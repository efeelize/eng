***Hey Linda, I want to talk to you about the PowerPoint Presentation you sent me. There are a few things you need to change.***

***Well, for starters you have way too much text on all these slides. Only add important points to each slide and some easy designs that’ll help illustrate what you are talking about.***

***Well I noticed you have many ideas on each slide. You need to stick to one idea per slide. The visuals are supposed to be there to supplement your presentation, not to make your presence unnecessary. You don’t want to read the text word for word during the presentation. So keep the text to a minimum.***

***Let me just add that your slide notes, which only you see, can contain a lot more information than your actual slides. So make sure to utilize your slide notes.***

***Now, I noticed you had a photo on one of the slides. Did you take the picture?***

***The photo is a bit blurry. I would suggest using a clearer photo; bear in mind that you should use high- quality photos on PowerPoint presentations.***

***Also this template that you’re using, is it from PowerPoint?***

***Well you’re showing this presentation to a group of people who have probably seen this template at least a dozen times. I’ll send you a link to a website that has a great deal of free PowerPoint templates that haven’t been overused.***

***Lastly, I would suggest using a story that illustrates your point. Some of these ideas are a bit complex, so giving examples or sharing a story that underscores the point might help. It should be short, intriguing and support your major points.***
