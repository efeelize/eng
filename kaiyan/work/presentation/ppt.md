# I.The original PowerPoint template /'tɛmplet/ [n. 模板]
> Microsoft PowerPoint was created thirty yearsago by Robert Gaskins [罗伯特] and Dennis Austin [丹尼斯·奥斯丁] at a software company called Forethought, Inc in1987 for Apple Computers. Just three monthslater, Microsoft acquired [v.买入] PowerPoint for $14 million. This was Microsoft's first significant acquisition[大型收购], and Microsoft set up a new business unit for PowerPoint in Silicon Valley where Forethought had been located.

> By 1997 PowerPoint sales[销量] had grown to morethan 4 million copies annually[年销量增长到400万以上], representing[占] 85 percent of the world market share. Also in 1997, an internal publication from the PowerPoint group said that by then over 20 million copies [2000万多份] of PowerPoint were in use, and that total revenues from PowerPoint during its first ten years (1987 to 1996) had already passed $1 billion[10亿美金]. Since the late 1990s, PowerPoint's market share of total world presentation software has been estimated /'estimetid/ [估计的] at 95 percent.

# II.do's
> PowerPoint is a great tool to enhance your presentations, but far too often we let it overwhelm us and our message.The following are some simple tips for making the best use of PowerPoint.

# 1.Use legible type size. 
> Titles should be at least 36 to 40 points, bulleted text or body copy at least 24 points.

# 2.Don't use too many words or include non-essential information.

# 3.Avoid hard-to-read color combinations

> 1)bulleted, there's also like dashes /dæʃ/ [n.破折号] or numbers or letters. This is for lists.So basically just means you put like a dot beside the text. And I mean I remember when we were in school, my teachers always told me anyway like you don't need to put a full sentence.

> 2)so you put a bullet point and then point form. You're going to making memos.So you don't need to put full ideas or sentences. You just kind of need to put like, you know, key words and things.

# 7.body copy & body text [n.正文]
> Right, there is one more term here body copy, this is just, another, another word we say is body text. And this is just like the main part, the main part of your presentation.So if it's an essay, your title, and then all of your esssay, that's the body.
