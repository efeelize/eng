# PPT
# I.The original PowerPoint template /'tɛmplet/ [n. 模板]
> Microsoft PowerPoint was created thirty yearsago by Robert Gaskins [罗伯特] and Dennis Austin [丹尼斯·奥斯丁] at a software company called Forethought, Inc in1987 for Apple Computers. Just three monthslater, Microsoft acquired [v.买入] PowerPoint for $14 million. This was Microsoft's first significant acquisition[大型收购], and Microsoft set up a new business unit for PowerPoint in Silicon Valley where Forethought had been located.

> By 1997 PowerPoint sales[销量] had grown to morethan 4 million copies annually[年销量增长到400万以上], representing[占] 85 percent of the world market share. Also in 1997, an internal publication from the PowerPoint group said that by then over 20 million copies [2000万多份] of PowerPoint were in use, and that total revenues from PowerPoint during its first ten years (1987 to 1996) had already passed $1 billion[10亿美金]. Since the late 1990s, PowerPoint's market share of total world presentation software has been estimated /'estimetid/ [估计的] at 95 percent.

# II.do's
> PowerPoint is a great tool to enhance your presentations, but far too often we let it overwhelm us and our message.The following are some simple tips for making the best use of PowerPoint.

# 1.Use legible type size. 
> Titles should be at least 36 to 40 points, bulleted text or body copy at least 24 points.

# 2.Be brief.
> A good rule of thumb is to cut paragraphs down to sentences, sentences into phrases, and phrases into keywords.

# 3.Use keywords to help your audience focus on your message.

# 4.Enhance readability.
> Don't crowd your slides. Use normal case (not all caps) and punctuate sparingly.

# 5.Make every word and image count.

# 6.Limit the number of slides.
> A good rule of thumb is one slide per minute.

# III.don'ts
# 1. Don't overuse special effects. 
> Use sound, animation, and other effects to emphasize major points, but don't let them become distracting.

# 2.Don't use too many words or include non-essential information.

# 3.Avoid hard-to-read color combinations 
> such as red/green, brown/green, blue/purple. Aim for high contrast between the background and text.

# 4.After you've created your slides, don't forget to go back and edit. 
> Take out sentences and replace them with keywords and phrases.

# 5.Don't include slides you can live without.

# 6.Don't make it too long. 
> Cut your presentation by as much as half so that your slides are streamlined.

# III.grammer

# 2.overwhemls [v.]
> 1)this is, can be used in war or battle with the enemy, has to, is too strong, and they defeat us because, you know, that's too much force.

# 3.making the best [phr.充分利用] & reach the potential
> 1)if you want to make something the best, you're making it better. You, you're certainly being very effective

# 4.legible [adj.易读的，能懂的] & illegible 
> 1)legible, now this is really specialized word like only for reading or writing.cause it means that it can be read.

> 2)illegible :so often doctors we say they have chicken scratch writing it's not legibly, can't read what the doctor writes on your prescription /prɪ'skrɪpʃən/ [n.处方].

# 5.type size
> so type size is basically if you use Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, that's just the number that you put beside, you know, what you've written.Exactly, so here they say title should be at least thirty six to forty points.

# 6.bulleted [adj.圆点符号] & point form [n.要点形式]
> 1)bulleted, there's also like dashes /dæʃ/ [n.破折号] or numbers or letters. This is for lists.So basically just means you put like a dot beside the text. And I mean I remember when we were in school, my teachers always told me anyway like you don't need to put a full sentence.

> 2)so you put a bullet point and then point form. You're going to making memos.So you don't need to put full ideas or sentences. You just kind of need to put like, you know, key words and things.

# 7.body copy & body text [n.正文]
> Right, there is one more term here body copy, this is just, another, another word we say is body text. And this is just like the main part, the main part of your presentation.So if it's an essay, your title, and then all of your esssay, that's the body.

# 8.rule of thumb /θʌm/ [phr.经验法则] & a good generanl rule
> we usually use this. It's just like a guideline that's easy to follow that you don't need any kind of special tool, like for example if you're measuring how much rice you need to make rice, you know, you use a good rule of thumb is use two handfuls of rice something like that.I think the rule of thumb is going to be twice as much water.Not exactly, you know, you can play with that. It's the good place to start from.

# 9.cut paragraphs down [phr.削减章节]
> Yeah trim /trɪm/ [v.削减] yeah, make it shorter or summarize.Yes, so if you get paragraphs when you change them to your PowerPoint, cut them down to sentences.If you've got sentences, cut them down to phrases. And if you got phrases, cut them down to keywords.

# 10.keywords
> so speaking of keywords, you want to use these to help your audience focus on the message.so you really don't want them to be looking and trying to read your PowerPoint, you just want some big keyboards so they can stay focused.

# 11.readability /ˌri:də'biləti/ [n.可读性] & readable  /'ridəbl/  & legible  /'lɛdʒəbl/ [adj. 易读的；清晰的]

> 2)Well, you see legible is more just like I can see clearly each letter.Yeah, this one just means the more, the flow, it's natural to read, yeah, it's comfortable.Right, cause some people, some people write, you know, like for example we said paragraph before.Some people write very bad sentences, very bad paragraphs.Right, kind of confusing, right?Confusing and you just don't really, there's a lot of we call them run-on sentences.Right, right, or wordy [adj.冗长的] sentences.

# 13.sparingly /ˈsp ɛrɪ ŋlɪ/ [adv. 节俭地;爱惜地]
> you should be sparing with punctuation,it's really a great phrase when use something sparingly.so use those sparingly which just means don't use too much, in fact use very little.Right, exactly, like I feel doctors, you know, they always prescribed  /prɪˈskraɪbd/ antibiotics /ˌæntɪbaɪˈ ɑtɪks/ [n.抗生素] .When you're sick. But sometimes, and sometimes people need that. But that's something that doctors do not prescribe, which not give out sparingly. And we might, you know, finding out in couple of years, oh, that's a problem.

# 14.punctuation /'pʌŋktʃʊ'eʃən/ [n] & punctuate  /tʃʊŋktjʊet/ [v.]
> 1)so punctuation, you guys probably know, is ,you know, commas, periods, dashes.

# 15.to make sth count [phr.重要，有意义]

# 16.convey & express
> Ok, so convey. That means like express.I always think of in an airport when you, when you go get your bags after you land, you gonna get your luggage there's this called the conveyor belt brings out your, your, your bags.or even if you put your bags through like a security check at a subway station or a train station, it's also a conveyor belt. It sends.It moves things from one to another. Yeah, so convey, you need, you want your meaning your message to be transferred to, move to the audience. So convey. so other ways we could use convey maybe convey meaning.convey an idea.

# 17.over+ [v.don't do it too much.]
> 1) Overuse[过度使用], now, you can probably see. Right there, we've got to the prefix[前缀] over and the word used.

> 3) overeat:Yeah, or if something is really delicious, you might overeat.

# 18.specoa effects [n.特效]
>  So special effects if you ever, ok, if you like movies with some of this CGI, yeah, like lasers /'lezɚ/ [n.激光] and spaceships, they have special effect.Kind of like just things that are not really there, that, that they make it look better like, like animation /ˌænɪ'meʃən/ [n.动画].
