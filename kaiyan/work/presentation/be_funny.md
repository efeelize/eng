# I.how to spice up a presentation
> If you want to be remembered and actually get people engaged, you need to make your presentation fun and enjoyable. Let’s look at some important aspects of giving a memorable and fun presentation.

# 1. Open up with a good ice-breaker
> To get some emotional response out of the audience right at the beginning, you can make a small, self-deprecating comment. You can also use sarcasm, open up with a short childhood story that taught you a lesson, quote a famous person and elaborate on it from personal experience [根据个人经历加以阐述]. 

# 2. Use a healthy dose of humor
> Some of the best speeches and presentations in the world all feature plenty of humor. No matter the subject, a great speaker will use natural charisma [n.魅力], humor and beautiful language [华丽辞藻] to convey their points and get the crowd [听众] excited about what they are saying. 

# 3. Engage the audience by making them relate [引起观众共鸣]
> Make comparisons to events from everyday life that most people are familiar with. In this way, you can help the audience understand the subject better and also draw a connection between you and your audience.[拉近你和观众之间的距离]

# II.grammar
# 1.while you're at it & “while you're doing that & doing that/it.
> 1)it is a simple and casual way to say, “while you're doing that.” In most cases, speakers use this phrase when adding suggestions or requests to a previous statement.

> 2)“at it” can also be used on its own to simply say, “doing that/it.” For example, “I’ve been working on this paragraph for an hour and I’m still at it.”

- 1. Maybe you could make a joke about a mistake that you made. And while you're at it, talk about how it inspired you to come up with this new idea. [或许你可以拿你犯的一个错误开个玩笑。这样做的时候，可以谈一下这件事是如何启发你想出这个新想法的] 

- 2. Could you grab some beer from the basement? Oh, and while you're at it, could you get the wine too? [你能从地库拿点啤酒来吗？对了，拿的时候，能也顺便带些红酒过来吗?] 

- 3. I thought it would take him 10 minutes to fix the problem, but he was at it for over an hour! [我原以为他只需要花10分钟来解决这个问题，但他却弄了一个多小时!]

# 2.humor
## 1) to add spice to sth & spice up [phr.增添趣味]
> 1)so to add spice to something like the pasta or a burger, means to add some chili peppers.

> 2)To spice up a presentation is to sort of make it more interesting and more fun,you could use this for something else as well. For example, you can spice up your resume, or you can spice up your house.or maybe you want to do something even bigger, like spice up your life.

## 2)crack a joke [phr.开个玩笑] & crack a smile / to crack (sb) up 
> 1)we usually say this as a chunk phrase because it's an idiom. So it's always "crack a joke."this is one of those idioms that it kind of sounds weird until you understand it, but essentially crack means to make, so crack a joke is like to make a joke.

> 2)sometimes we also say "crack a smile",or to crack up.To crack up just means to laugh. For example, he cracks me up, so he makes me laugh.It doesn't have anything to do with breaking though.

## 3)lighten the mood [phr.活跃气氛] & lighten up [phr.放轻松]
> 1)So when you lighten the mood, you make it a little bit less serious and a little bit more fun.this is really important when you kind of first meet people, or you're giving a presentation and you kind of wanna make a good impression at the start.

> 2)you don't want it to be depressing. You could also use "lighten" as a verb like, "Lighten up, don't be so serious."

## 4)ice-breaker [n.创造气氛之语(或动作)]
> so an ice breaker is something that is supposed to remove the awkwardness or tension when you first meet someone.That could be a joke, or maybe you want to do an activity, like an ice-breaker activity where everyone learns each other's names.

## 5)to acknowledge [承认；认可] & acknowlegment
> 1)So "to acknowledge it" means to kind of recognize something, and admit it. For example, if I acknowledge that I've made mistakes and I tell people, "Yes, that was a mistake. I'm sorry."

> 2)so we can acknowledge sort of negative things, but we can also acknowledge good things. So like, if someone does a good job at work, we can acknowledge it, we can tell other people about it.

> 3)we can give acknowledgment;maybe we'll say like."You did a great job,here's a promotion."

## 6)witty /ˈwɪti/ [诙谐的]

## 7)self-deprecating [adj.自嘲的] & to deprecate
> 1)so if you're making a joke at your own expense, you're probably being a little self-deprecating. We can make fun of ourselves. We can put ourselves down, and it can be funny. But sometimes it's not always funny, Like, maybe someone's too modest, and that's sort of been self-deprecating too. But in this sense, it's for humor.

> 2)Now to deprecate means to put something down,To talk about something like you don't approve of it.

# 3.lack of humor 
## 1)flops /flɑːps/ [v.失败；不奏效]
> a lot of different things could flop, like a presentation could flop, a speech could flop, or movie could flop at the box office.so if a movie flops at the box office [票房收入], it means not a lot of people went to see it. It didn't do well.

## 2)dad jokes [phr.老套尴尬的笑话]
> Dads jokes, these are just really really embarrassing jokes that your dad tells other people. So for example, a lot of them are puns [n.双关语], like "Why don't eggs tell jokes? They'd crack each other up." things like this.

## 3)dry [adj.枯燥的；乏味的]
> so when we use that word as an adjective, we're saying it's getting a little bit boring or dull. For example, if you have a book and it's kind of boring, we sometimes refer to that as a dry read. And one of the best ways to spice up something that's a little bit dry is to throw in some humor.

## 4)discouraged [受挫的，泄气的]

## 5)sarcasm /ˈsɑːrkæzəm/ [讽刺] & sarcastic /sɑːrˈkæstɪk/ [讽刺的；挖苦的]
> 1）So sarcasm is a type of humor, and it's when we say the opposite of what we mean actually.

# 4.feeling
## 1)to relate to sb/sth [v.认同；产生共鸣]  & relatable [adj.]
> 1)relate is the verb, and you always see "relate to someone" or "relate to something." it means to have a connection to this things.like on a personal level, so it's like "Yo, I really get you bro. I understand you.

> 2)empathy is more related to the emotions.Empathy really makes people feel more connected to you. A great way to create empathy is just to focus on a mistake that everyone makes, but while you're at it, you can also add some sarcasm.

## 3)to empathize with sb/sth [v.有同感，产生共鸣]
> That is the verb, to empathize with someone.because you have the same experience, so you can empathize with them. 

## 4）empathetic [adj.]
> if you have a lot of empathy, we call you empathetic.

# 5.at your own expense [phr.以自己为代价、自费] 
> 1)basically you're making fun of yourself.

> 2)at your own expense, this could also be related to money. For example, a company will pay for your trip, but all the sightseeing might be at your own expense, meaning that you have to pay for this yourself.

- 1. He made a joke at your boss's expense, and it flopped terribly. [他开了个你老板的玩笑，但是一点不好笑]

# 6.take yourself too seriously [phr.把自己看得太重] 
> That's like really good final bit of advice here, because if everything flops, he doesn't get the acknowledgment that he wants, at the end of the day, it's just another day. Life goes on. Don't take yourself too seriously.it will be all right.

- 1. Self-deprecation can be funny, but just make sure that you don't overdo it. [自嘲会很有趣，但要确保不要做得太过了]
