# I.The paid and unpaid leaves of absence in U.S.
> In the U.S., requirements regarding leaves of absence vary from state to state[因州而异] and some leaves of absence are required by Federal laws.

# 1.Bereavement time
> Bereavement /bɪ'rivmənt/ time [丧假] is an example of a leave of absence during which employers pay the employee for a certain number of days and then, the employee can extend the time away from work by applying for an unpaid leave.[然后可以申请无薪休假延长假期]

# 2. Jury duty 
> Jury /'dʒʊri/ duty [陪审义务假期] is another example of a paid leave of absence that is required by law in most jurisdictions, although the employer may set policies [规定] about how long they are willing to pay the employee's salary for an extended trial.

# 3.unpaid leaves
> Employees might want to take unpaid leaves of absence in the following cases: Caring for a sick family member who is not a member of their immediate family, obtaining medical treatment in another country, an extended visit to an employee’s home country to see family[延长回国探亲假], extra time for parental /pə'rɛntl/ leave [产假] past the 12 weeks that are allotted /ə'lɔtid/ by the Family and Medical Leave Act[家庭和医疗休假法案], and time away from work to deal with the estate /ɪ'stet/ of a loved one[处理亲属的遗产].

# II.grammar
# 1.Take ((time,, week,, day)) off
> When talking about vacation or holidays from work, try using the phrase “time off work.” For example, “I have time off work.” Also, try using the verb “take” before the phrase. For example, “Do you need to take time off work?” If it’s a different period of time, just replace the word “time” with that period of time: an hour, a day, a week, even a month. Finally, you don’t need to say “time off work,” you can just say “time off.” For example, “Do you need to take a day off?”

- 1. I need to take a few days off because I'm getting so stressed.

- 2. She took the morning off work to see the dentist.

- 3. We get a week off in the summer for vacation.

***Thanks for coming to today's presentation on leave policies. Before I start, does anyone know how much annual leave you're allowed?***

***Right, and that leads me to my first point. It's important to put in your holiday requests early, so we can schedule everybody's time off.***

***What if we take time off on a public holiday?***

***In that case, you still get holiday pay. Moving on, if you are a new mother, you can get a year of maternity leave.***

***Yep, it is. And finally, sick leave. Everyone gets nine sick days per year. Does anyone have any questions before we finish?***
