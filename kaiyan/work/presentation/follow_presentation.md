# I.The paid and unpaid leaves of absence in U.S.
> In the U.S., requirements regarding leaves of absence vary from state to state[因州而异] and some leaves of absence are required by Federal laws.

# 1.Bereavement time
> Bereavement /bɪ'rivmənt/ time [丧假] is an example of a leave of absence during which employers pay the employee for a certain number of days and then, the employee can extend the time away from work by applying for an unpaid leave.[然后可以申请无薪休假延长假期]

# 2. Jury duty 
> Jury /'dʒʊri/ duty [陪审义务假期] is another example of a paid leave of absence that is required by law in most jurisdictions, although the employer may set policies [规定] about how long they are willing to pay the employee's salary for an extended trial.

# 3.unpaid leaves
> Employees might want to take unpaid leaves of absence in the following cases: Caring for a sick family member who is not a member of their immediate family, obtaining medical treatment in another country, an extended visit to an employee’s home country to see family[延长回国探亲假], extra time for parental /pə'rɛntl/ leave [产假] past the 12 weeks that are allotted /ə'lɔtid/ by the Family and Medical Leave Act[家庭和医疗休假法案], and time away from work to deal with the estate /ɪ'stet/ of a loved one[处理亲属的遗产].

# II.grammar
# 1.Take ((time,, week,, day)) off
> When talking about vacation or holidays from work, try using the phrase “time off work.” For example, “I have time off work.” Also, try using the verb “take” before the phrase. For example, “Do you need to take time off work?” If it’s a different period of time, just replace the word “time” with that period of time: an hour, a day, a week, even a month. Finally, you don’t need to say “time off work,” you can just say “time off.” For example, “Do you need to take a day off?”

- 1. I need to take a few days off because I'm getting so stressed.

- 2. She took the morning off work to see the dentist.

- 3. We get a week off in the summer for vacation.

# 2.annual leave & holiday requests [n.休假申请] & public holiday [n.公共假期] & holiday pay [n.假期工资] & sick leave [n.病假]
> 1)so annual means every year.Annual we can use this word in almost any event that happens every year like the Academy Awards is an annual event. Music awards happen every year those are annual events.

> 2)So leave includes vacation time or time that you take off because you're sick.so every year the company gives you a certain number of days that you can go on vacation for.

> 3)request, wouldn't you say it's kind of a, a polite or a formal word?it is, and request can be used as a verb or a noun but ask, we usually just use it as verb.For sure, now so you can put in a request, in this case, it's a holiday request.but you could put in other kinds of requests as well, for example you could put in a request for overtime pay.

> 4)A public holiday is when everybody like the whole country has to take one day off.

> 5)So if if the government says you cannot come to work today we still give you money and that money is called holiday pay. You get paid to stay home.

> 6)We like to plan our holidays and when we're going to take a vacation, but we can never plan when we're going to be sick. And that's what this is all about. In this case, it looks like everyone gets nine sick days per year. I think after that, it's okay to be sick, but you're not gonna get paid.

# 3.that leads me to [phr.这就引导了]
> We use this, that leads me to, we use this phrase to introduce something, but it has to be connected to the last thing you said, and that's a good point Lisa, we also say that brings me to. So for example, that brings me to or that leads me to the next picture.

# 4.maternity /mə'tɝnəti/ leave [n.产假（妈妈）] &  paternity /pə'tɝnəti/ leave [n.产假（爸爸）] & sick leave [n.病假]
> 1)maternity leave is when you are pregnant or have just given birth to a child.so if your going to have a baby, well at this company, they can get a year of maternity leave and maternity just means mother.

> 2)paternity leave：That means father and when it's for both parents, it's called parental leave.

# III.pattern
***Thanks for coming to today's presentation on leave policies. Before I start, does anyone know how much annual leave you're allowed?***

***Right, and that leads me to my first point. It's important to put in your holiday requests early, so we can schedule everybody's time off.***

***What if we take time off on a public holiday?***

***In that case, you still get holiday pay. Moving on, if you are a new mother, you can get a year of maternity leave.***

***Yep, it is. And finally, sick leave. Everyone gets nine sick days per year. Does anyone have any questions before we finish?***
