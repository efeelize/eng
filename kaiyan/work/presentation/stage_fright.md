# I.What is Toastmasters？
> Toastmaster is a general term[通用的词], prevalent /'prɛvələnt/ [adj.普遍的,盛行的] in the United States in the middle 20th century[20世纪中期], referring to a person in charge of the proceedings of a public speaking event[需要公开演讲维持活动进程的人]. The toastmaster is typically charged with organization of the event[负责组织活动], arranging the order of speakers, introducing one or more of the speakers, and keeping the event on schedule[确保活动按时间安排进行].

> Toastmasters International (TI) is a US headquartered nonprofit educational organization [国际化的非营利教育组织，总部设立在美国] that operates clubs [分支俱乐部] worldwide for the purpose of promoting communication[宣传沟通], public speaking, and leadership skills.

> The organization grew out of [发展而来] a single club, Smedley Chapter One Club, which would become the first Toastmasters club. It was founded by Ralph C. Smedley on October 22, 1924, at the YMCA [基督教青年会] in Santa Ana, California, United States. It originated as a set of classes [有一系列的课程] with the aim of improving the communication skills of the young men under his charge.

> The first international chapter [国际分会] was established in Vancouver, Canada in 1932. The organization began admitting [招收] women in 1973.

> Throughout its history [纵观其历史], Toastmasters has served over four million people, and today the organization serves over 352,000 members in 141 countries, through its 16,400 member clubs. Toastmasters membership increased rapidly around the turn of the century [21世纪初], nearing 16,000 clubs worldwide by 2016.

# II.stage fright
> Also known as "performance anxiety," stage fright is the fear of having to perform in front of others. And don't let the name fool you, stage fright isn't just limited to people in the entertainment industry. Ever feel a bit shaky before having to give a presentation in front of your coworkers? Yep, that's considered stage fright too.

# 1.symptoms 
> Say, speaking of feeling shaky, let's go over some other symptoms caused by the stress of being the center of attention.

> 1)Racing pulse /pʌls/ [n.脉搏] and rapid breathing (you know, when your heart goes thump thump thump thump thump!).

> 2)Dry mouth and tight throat (this is the worst because it is a dead giveaway[n.彻底的出卖] of your anxiety, which causes you to become even more anxious because you know people can sense your anxiety!).

> 3)Sweaty and cold hands.

> 4)Nausea /'nɔzɪə/ [n.恶心] and an overall uneasy[adj.不舒服的] feeling in your stomach.

> 5)Vision changes (wow, talk about serious!).

# 2.tips
> The reason for these symptoms /'sɪmptəm/ [n.症状] is that stage fright causes your body to react much like if it were being attacked and thus go into "fight-or-flight" mode.OK, now that we know all of this, let's go over some tips that will help you conquer your stage fright.

> 1)Be prepared! Having practiced a lot before your performance should help you feel a lot more confident.

> 2)Limit your caffeine and sugar intake /'ɪn'tek/ [n.摄入量], and eat a sensible meal beforehand. Otherwise, being jittery /'dʒɪtəri/ [adj.紧张不安的] and hungry could sabotage /ˌsæbə'tɑʒ/ [v.破坏] your performance!

> 3)Don't focus on what could go wrong. Remain positive and envision /ɪn'vɪʒn/ [vt.想像] your success!

> 4)Practice controlled breathing, meditation  /ˌmɛdɪ'teʃən/ [n.沉思] or some other relaxation techniques that will redirect your thoughts and calm your nerves.

> 5)Connect with your audience by thinking of them as your friends. Do your best to smile and make eye contact with them.

> 6)And before I get out of here today, I'll let you guys in on an old trick [告诉大家一个古老的招数] that everyone used to say helps get rid of stage fright. Are you ready for it?OK, the trick is to picture the audience in their underwear. Sounds silly, right? The idea is that if you picture them in their underwear, you will see them as more vulnerable than yourself and therefore feel more comfortable in front of them.I'm not sure if it really works, but maybe you can give this trick a try next time you have to perform in front of others.
