# Giving a presentation

# I.Easy tricks to make your presentation interactive
> If you're looking for ways to make your presentation more engaging and interactive, try these ideas.

# 1.Ask for interaction[互动]
> It sounds too obvious – yet it works. Start your presentation by telling the audience you want their questions and that you expect interaction. Tell them when you’d like them to ask, and if you’ll have designated times for it.

# 2. Ask a great question at the beginning to get people talking
> When it comes to presentations, most of us are used to being talked to, rather than being asked to share our own thoughts. Opening with a question turns this idea on its head. You can ask the audience what they'd like to get out of the session or why they came. You can poll the group for their opinion about a topic.

# 3. Get people's opinion
> One evergreen rule of presenting is to know your audience. One way to do that is to ask them what they actually think. You can go so far as to point to a specific person and ask for their opinion (works best in a small group) or to query a portion of the room.

# II.give a confident and compelling presentation.
> Please note that, in our language of English, attention is paid because attention is a valuable currency. When listeners pay attention, they are rewarding you with arguably /'ɑrɡjuəbli/ [adv. 可论证地] the most valuable currency in the world.Here are some techniques that are guaranteed to earn you more attention without losing any of your professional credibility.

# 1. Start with the unexpected.  
> Start with a bang, not a whimper /'wɪmpɚ/ [n.平庸] . Smokers like matches that light with the first strike, and listeners like presentations that ignite interest with the first sentence.For instance: "We stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw and felt the worst of war."--President Ronald Reagan

# 2. Make it about them. 
> Now that you've gotten listeners' attention withyour magnetic /mæg'nɛtɪk/ [adj.有吸引力的] opening, make the story about them. Talk about their goals, their aspirations, their anxieties.

# 3. Get to the point. [直击重点]
> One of the great pleasures the audience has is quickly grasping what you're getting at. They resent [v.讨厌] you when you rob them of this pleasure.

# 4. Arouse emotion. [引发情绪]
> Humor is inherently /in'hiərəntli/ persuasive [自带说服力]. It gives the speaker an unfair advantage because it literally /'lɪtərəli/ [adv.确实地,真正地] changes the chemistry in the room, and in the brain of everyone present.

# 5. Write clear headlines. [列出清晰的关键句]
> Write headlines for your slides that express apoint of view[为每一页配一个关键句]. The audience will get the big idea and look at the body of the slide for evidence that supports your point.

# III.What's the key to giving confident and compelling presentations?

> Instead of seeing speaking as a performance, think of it as being in service of your audience's needs. Make the question " What does my audience need to hear from me? " your mantra.

# 1.being in service of your audience's needs
> Instead of seeing speaking as a performance, think of it as being in service of your audience's needs. Make the question " What does my audience need to hear from me? " your mantra.Probably without thinking about it, ok. So that is a very very very important thing to keep in mind your audience's needs, but of course as a presenter, as someone who is sharing information, it's very difficult to balance seeing your audience as a bunch of people that maybe don't know as much as you, or also seeing your audience as, you know, an intelligent group of people that are able to understand what you are saying.

# 2. walk a fine
> You need to walk a fine line between making it easy for them to understand your message, without " dumbing down " your content. Above all else, make sure that your content is relevant and easily accessible to them.

# 3.Emotion sticks
> People remember emotionally-charged messages much more readily than fact-based ones.

# 4.Using a memorized script
> Using a memorized script can actually increase performance anxiety. An outline, on the other hand, is a very practical tool to help speakers prepare and deliver.Right, so a lot of our speakers are plagued /pleɡ/ [v.困扰] by performance anxiety, and one way to get around that is to just make an outline.Yeah, that way you're not actually memorizing the words, you can memorize the ideas, the flow, the structure, right? That's something you don't even have to memorize it, because most people expect you to have some kind of paper, like some kind of script to on stage, but the script doesn't have to be like a movie script, now you must say all these lines.Right, that's really going to tie you down at the piece of paper.

> Yeah, this is kind of fun, right? Because obviously, these little questions are ones that we use every single day.You know like what, I didn't hear you, yeah, so what, I don't care or should I care and then you know, now what, what should we do.Implications   /'ɪmplɪ'keʃən/ [n. 暗示], exactly. Up now, just be able to kind of internalized /ɪn'tɝnəlaɪz/ [vt. 使内在化] that structure.

# 5.Structure will set you free!
>  A great structure to use is "What? - So what? - Now what?", which can also be useful in spontaneous speaking situations, such as job interviews.When using this structure, you start with your central claim ("I am qualified for this position because of my experience") and then explain its importance or value ("This experience will allow me to start contributing to your firm immediately") before concluding with a call to action or next steps ("So when can I start?").

# 6.parctice properly.
> Practice makes perfect,but many presenters don't practice properly.They use passive approaches like flipping through a slide deck, which doesn't really simulate the conditions of a presentation.To practice effectively, you also need to stand up, open your mouth and use appropriate /ə'proprɪət/ [adj.适当的] hand gestures.This improves memory consolidation, or the process by which a thought becomes cemented into your long-term memory.Yeah, this is a really good tip, and I didn't actually think about this until we started prepping /prep/ this lesson[备课], is when you are giving a presentation, your hands are always moving. So when you practice, you need to be moving your hands as such，in a natural way.

> Exactly. So one of the things here I do really find interesting is this idea of actually moving your hands standing up, simulating this presentation process just as a way that you can kind of remember all of your little cues. You know you move your hand like this, I means, ok, it's time to move on to the next topic. You you know, move your hand like that. It's time to make the joke that's going to make everyone laugh.

# 7. forgetfulness
> Drawing a blank when you're standing before an audience can have traumatic implications that can damage your credibility.If you must overtly acknowledge your forgetfulness, do it in a clever way that portrays this negative occurrence as a byproduct of a positive trait: "You'll have to excuse me, but I am so passionate about my topic that I sometimes get ahead of myself."Too often, people who blank out try to figure out what they need to say next. But you are more likely to get back on track if you reorient yourself by looking to what you said previously.

# IV.When Your Mind Goes Blank
> Imagine this scenario /sə'nærɪo/ : You’ve worked hard to prepare for an important presentation, panel /'pænl/ [小组讨论], or media interview. A lot is riding on your performance: – your company, and your own reputation. Then the big day comes, you walk into the room, and suddenly your mind goes blank … totally blank.Do you panic? Do you convey your fear? There are better ways to recover and get back on track.

# 1.Remember this swimming lesson rule: don’t panic
> Even when you are literally disoriented /dis'ɔ:rientid/ [adj.迷惑] and forget what you are supposed to say, the worst thing you can do is panic. Recall the swim lessons from your childhood. A panicking swimmer will find it more difficult to stay afloat /ə'flot/ [adj. & adv. 浮在水面(的)]. When you stay calm, you will recover much more quickly and easily.

# 2.Pretend you are in Las Vegas: keep a poker face
> Truth be told[说实话], mere seconds of silence can feel like an eternity when you are the focus of everyone’s attention[当你成为每个人关注的焦点时，仅仅几秒钟的沉默会感觉像是永恒]. Your own silence can feel deafening /'dɛfnɪŋ/ [adj.震耳欲聋的]. To your audience, however, those seconds are merely a pause. Unless you somehow indicate to your audience that you’ve lost your place or that your mind has gone blank, they won’t know!

# 3.Repeat, fast forward through, or glance at yournotes
> Jog /dʒɑɡ/ [vt.&vi.(使)慢走、慢跑] your memory by repeating the last thing you said (aloud or silently in your own mind) or by jumping forward to something else that you remember. If the point you forgot is important, you can later incorporate /ɪnˈkɔrpəˌret/ [v.把…合并] it in your presentation once that message comes back to you. Or, you can always bring up that message point during the Q&A.

# V.grammer
# 1.transitional words
> The words that kind of help us to move from one thought or one idea to the next.

# 2.presentation/speech
> 1)Alright. So we're back. And Tim is giving his opening sentence, he says, "My name is Tim and I'm here to give a presentation on why English is important".OK. So presentation, we all kind of know what a presentation is. Presentation, when I see this word, I think about PowerPoint, introducing something.Like in meeting, someone is always, you know, they're using their computer to show us maybe some pictures or just other things up on a big screen.

> 2)So a speech is just when you're talking.

# 3.comes to mind
> It just means what do you think of?

# 4.as you may know [phr.或许你们知道]
>  So as you may know, we often put this before some kind of information or statistic that we're giving our audience.Because maybe they know that already.A lot of people probably do know that but someone.Yes. So you'll hear this often in the presentation. Pretty formal, isn't it?

# 5.graph
> Right. There are many different kinds of graphs. But they always show like numbers or things, right? If they are going up or going down. The common one is the pie chart.That's good that you said chart, because basically when we're giving presentations, you could say graph, you could say chart, they're pretty much the same thing.Basically yes, and, and when we give these presentations they're usually on a slide.

# 6.significantly
> Right. This is a really great word to use in your presentation. Significantly. It means a lot.A lot, yeah. But there are a few really important, there are useful phrases that we use it in, like for example, numbers significantly reduced.Yeah. It's usually about numbers going up or down.Right. Here we have increased. You could say decreased or reduced like Connor just said. But really just any kind of change.

# 7.in other words
> So in other words, great phrase. You kind of want to repeat yourself, but of course you can't say the same thing twice, so you just decide to use other words.Yeah. In other words, saying it a different way, usually a little more simply, right?

# 8.opens up [phr.打开]
>  In other words, saying it a different way, usually a little more simply, right?Yeah. And that's simple way to say that is that it opens up many professional opportunities.OK. So let's use our brains for a second here, opportunities can be thought of as doors.

# 10.what's more
> It really just means furthermore.Yeah. Furthermore. Now the problem is in daily speech we don't really say furthermore very much, do we?It's too fancy, right? So we could say what's more, it's just like saying, "Oh, in addition to that, not only that".

# 11.require/need
> which means a need.And are there really any other differences between require and need?

> require.Not really. It's also a little more formal things, like what you required to get into university.

# 12.broaden your mind/horizon.
> I think so too. Exactly, yes. So broaden your mind, it's kind of like making it bigger.Right. If something is broad, it means that it is wide.

> It's wide. Exactly. So we use this phrase, broaden your mind. We also say broaden your horizon.Yeah. Don't be that frog in the well, you want to be the frog, look at the wide wide sky, the horizon.

# 13.compelling [adj.使人信服的] / compelled 
> 1)compelling:it just means that something it's hard not to believe.It's to force someone to do something, but if something is compelling…It almost like it forces you to pay attention.

> 2)You know exciting and excited, it's the same idea with compelling, you feel very compelled.

# 14.in service of/to  [phr.为他人服务] & sth in service
> 1)So I'm not there to perform, I'm there to serve.But it doesn't matter if you are giving a speech, if you're giving a presentation or if you're singing a song, the audience is so important.Yeah, you're there in service of their excitement and enjoyment.Right, exactly. Now, in service as a phrase, it's not something that we run across every day.

> 2)Like meaning available.It's available, it's being used like an old battleship /'bætlʃɪp/ [n.战列舰] or something that was in service but now it's out of service.or the service or out of service.

> 3)In service of and in service to both mean for the sake of or in order to serve or benefit. They are often interchangeable, although in service to is usually more limited to physical entities (people, government, country), while in service of can be used to talk about abstract things as well (e.g., in service of a higher purpose). However, there is no strict rule, so usage should be examined case by case.[两者是可以互换的，但in service to一般是指向实际主体（如：为了人、政府、国家），而in service of也可以指向抽象主体（如：为了更高的追求。]

- The soldiers died in service to their country.
- The researchers are doing the study in service of the public interest.
- Being in the service of others is a rewarding experience[获益颇多] that can lead to the betterment /'bɛtɚmənt/ [n.改进] of oneself and the community.
- She gave everything in service to her people.

# 15.mantra /'mæntrə/ [n.牢记的准则] &  catchphrase /'kætʃfreiz/ [n.标语]
> Your mantra, yeah. So it's like a sound in that case a sound, but it could be a word or a phrase that you say again and again.Right, that's the key you want to repeat it, it's this idea of kind of like meditating /'mɛdɪtet/ [vi. 冥想] on the phrase, you know.Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like we were talking about like catchphrase.

# 16.walk a fine line [phr.努力达到平衡]
> Right, and this is a wonderful phrase, walk a fine line between two things and that fine line again that you need to walk is between having them not understand at all, or only being able to communicate these dumbed-down ideas that don't even matter.

# 17.dumb down
> Right, so dumb down, this is a phrase we use a lot kind of in casual English, it just means make some technical term easier to understand.Right, right, like I could say like could you dumb it down for me please?Right, that's good, cuz it almost shows like modesty?It means humble. I'm not as smart as you .

# 18.above all else [phr.首先，高于一切的] / above all 
> 1)So when we use this phrase above all else, it just basically means most importantly.And we can use it at the beginning of a sentence.

> 2)Right, and you could take out the else too, you could just say above all,it's just a great little phrase there that means this is very important.

# 19.relevant[adj.相关的，有意义的] & related [adj.有关系,有关联的]
> But relevant is more like, it's useful.It's useful to our present conversations, now.So for example, Adam, if I asked you what do you like, coffee or tea?Yeah, and I answered that I don't like sugar in my drinks, it's related because of course you put sugar in tea, but just not relevant that wasn't the answer that the speaker was looking for.

# 20.accessible [adj.易懂的]
> Wasn't part of it, exactly. Now, one good thing about my answer there was that even though it wasn't relevant, it was probably pretty accessible. Well, accessible, kind of just means like usable or understandable.Yeah, understandable. Common people can access it kind of. Alright, so that's really important, but there's another thing that's really important and that is emotion.

# 21.sticks [v.保持持久]
> you know, when you evoke these kinds of emotions, it kind of activates /'æktə'vet/ [v. 触发] your memory, activates your brain in a more sort of engaged way.

# 22.emotionally-charged [adj.情绪强烈的]
> Right, and it could be for language, for messages, for a speech, for a phrase, politicians often use this kind of language.Yeah, all they do, for sure, cause they know that emotions sticks and and this word in this phrase "charged", it's like electricity, right?Yeah, sure. It's power, right? 

# 23.fact-based [adj.基于事实的]
> You think about it as power if it's emotionally-charged just giving a fact-based speeches, there not very powerful.They don't stick in the same way that emotionally-charged ones do.Right, cause facts are sometimes boring.

# 24. readily  /'rɛdɪli/ [adv.容易的]
> Yeah, readily available is a pretty common collocation there.Yeah, readily agreed, they readily agreed to the deal.

# 25.memorized [v.记忆]
> Yeah. memorizing means just remembering every single word.Right, but you're not really thinking about it, not very useful.Yeah, not very useful, you're just intentionally remembering it to just spit out later.Right, exactly, but this actually makes a lot of people nervous.They just, if you have your entire presentation memorized from start to finish, it actually doesn't help you.

# 26.performance anxiety [n.表演前怯场] & get stage fright /fraɪt/ & get butterflies in your stomach.
> Yeah, because when you get on stage and you're nervous, we call that performance anxiety.Right, and as you can probably guess, performance anxiety is just as you are giving a performance, you feel very anxious.You're nervous, you're probably speaking too quickly, you're sweating, forget lines that you thought you had memorized.

# 27.spontaneous /spɑn'tenɪəs/  [adj.自然产生的、即兴的]
> Yeah, meaning it's, it's random.good phrase there. So we use spontaneous in a lot of ways, a spontaneous person.Hmm, right, a spontaneous decision.

# 28.claim
> 1)I mean it could be negative, it could be positive. Again, it's something that the speaker is asserting is true, but maybe there's no obvious or clear proof.Right, it's not necessarily true, it's just saying.

> 2)Now in job interviews, it's up to you guys to decide if your claims are going to be true or false, you might want to embellish /ɛmˈbɛlɪʃ/ [vt. 美化] a little bit.you could think about that as what being, I am qualified for this position.

# 29.call to action [n.行动号召]
> This is a good buzzword /ˈbʌzˌwə..d/ [流行术语] for advertisers.Um it just means, you know, ask the listener to do something.For more information or to, you know, to sign up blah blah blah, because I mean again this what, so what, now what, you will also see this in advertisements, which are also really forms of presentations, right?Exactly, it's really easy to miss that because you think oh, the listener will know, that it's obvious, but actually it's not obvious, we need some kind of a cue, right?

# 30.flip through
> practice is boring, exactly, and again, we don't kind of practice the right stuff like, for example, if we're doing a presentation, we just might flip through the slides /slaɪd/ [n.幻灯片].Right, you're not really looking, or I think the word that we hear in the clip, passive/'pæsɪv/ [adj.消极的]. We do it passively. You're just kind of like, oh yeah, uh-huh, okay, okay. This page, that page, flip flip flip.

# 31.simulate
> Right, exactly, so simulate means make it seem real.Yeah, exactly, you're kind of imitating or copying some kind of real condition.Yeah, and I, I mean, in fact, like astronauts /'æstrə'nɔt/ [n. 宇航员, 太空人], when they practice, you know, like they have to go through all kinds of simulations to just experience what it would be like in space.Right, even pilots have to use flight simulators.

# 32.consolidation /kən,sɑlə'deʃən/ [n] & consolidated [v.]
> 1)consolidation means to make something stronger, usually by combining it.Right, well you see the word solid, right in the middle, so right away you should think ok, and 'con-' usually means together.So there's something here that is being joined, and and, and somehow getting stronger in that process.For sure. 

> 2)Things that get consolidated, like finances, you can consolidate a company.Right, exactly. Now, in this case we're basically talking about making your memories stronger and there's another word that comes up in the same line that means kind of the same thing.

# 33.cemented /sɪ'mɛnt/ [v.融合、粘合]
>  so cement is very strong. It doesn't change and that's kind of the meaning here. It's stuck.

# 34.long-term memory & short-term memory
> Exactly, well, like learning is not just about listening. It's a, can be like a total physical thing.Sure, and it can even sort of relate this to English. When you're practicing English, really open your mouth, really speak in an almost unnatural way. Just so you can get that muscle memory. Submit that into your brain.

# 35.drawing a blank [phr.忘词] & blank out [phr.头脑空白] & blanked 
> 1） so draw a blank just means it's when you're talking and suddenly your brain just kind of goes white.

> 2)And this is something you could actually use to if you are in a conversation with someone and maybe they ask you a question, maybe you don't quite understand what they asked you, maybe you if you forget somebody's name.That is a really good time. Yeah, you just you can just look at someone, just kind of smile and say you know I remember talking to you. We had a really interesting conversation.

# 36.traumatic  /traʊ'mætɪk/ [adj.创伤性] & trauma /'traʊmə/ [n. 外伤；创伤]
> 1)But when you're doing presentations, this is such a scary thing to think about, oh, what if I draw a blank, and if it happens, it can have traumatic implications. So it almost feels like that when you're in front of people because traumatic is like really shockingly bad.

> 2)It's the kind of things that soldiers feel. When they come back from war, they always talk about war is trauma.Yeah, and doctors talk about, oh, he had a trauma.Oh, yeah. If he got shocked or stabbed or something, that is trauma in a medical sense. It's really serious.Yeah, very emotional and long-lasting.That's it. Yeah, trauma does not go away.

# 37.credibility [n.可信度] & trustworthy /'trʌstwɝði/ [adj. 值得信赖的, 可靠的]
> Yeah, so credibility is just can I trust you.Can I trust you and in the presentation context, it's should I listen to you.

# 38.overtly /oˈvə..tlɪ/ [adv.公然的，明显的] & overly /'ovɚli/ [adv.过度的]
> 1）So the spelling here is O V E R T L Y.Right. And we don't really stress that T very much.They could be. Overtly means it's stated. It's now in the open. It's not a secret. It's obvious.

> 2) The problem is even a lot of native speakers confused this word with another very similar one overly.It's obvious. Yeah, exactly. Overly just means a lot, too much.

# 39.portrays /pɔr'tre/ [v.描绘] & portrait /'pɔrtrət/ [n. 肖像, 画像]
> 1)you gonna do it in a way that shows portrays this mistake as just a natural byproduct of a positive thing. 

> 2)Now, portray this word is actually very similar to the word portrait which is a type of painting.it shows somebody's face. Interesting enough in the history of painting in the west, there were always very strict rules about how Jesus could be portrayed. That's how he could be painted and even his death.

# 40.byproduct[n.副产品] & side effect
> 1) a good byproduct of sth.

> 2) So when you take medication there could be some results, right?You don't want to see, usually negative.So if you take the medicine, so that your hair will grow back or maybe it will also grow back in places you don't want it to grow.

# 41.go ahead of myself [phr.思绪太快]
> It is good. So, yeah, I just messed up. I just screwed up my mind is drawing a blank and instead of saying sorry. You have to excuse me. I'm so passionate about my topic. I love this topic so much that I sometimes get ahead of myself.Right, it's like you're getting too excited you jumping ahead.A lot of times I think when my friends don't think something through. That's why I think they are getting ahead of themselves.They more like too fast, right?

# 42.get back on track [phr.回到正轨] & get off track & derailed /di'reild/ [v.脱轨]
> 1)It means You're on the right way.Yes, if you're doing some work and you get side track. Yeah, you could say, well I got off track. And now I'm back on track.

> 2)Derailed. Right, exactly, and now, of course, if you are off track or if you somehow got ahead of yourself, if you somehow got off track, the way to reorient yourself is to go back to what you said previously, which I think is really smart. Because a lot of people are going to try to save the next thing. But really if you just go back and say, and what was on.

# 43.reorient /ri:'ɔ:rient/ [v.重新调整]
> Takes me a second to reorient. So reorient, this is just about direction, right? So reorient means to find the right direction again.Yes, exactly. I'm going to thinking like with all the GPS stuff we have now. Sometimes when you lose your connection, but it it just takes a moment to send the signal back to the satellite /'sætəlaɪt/ [n.卫星], and ok ok, we know where you are.
