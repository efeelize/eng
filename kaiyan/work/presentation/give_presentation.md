# Giving a presentation

# I.Easy tricks to make your presentation interactive
> If you're looking for ways to make your presentation more engaging and interactive, try these ideas.

# 1.Ask for interaction[互动]
> It sounds too obvious – yet it works. Start your presentation by telling the audience you want their questions and that you expect interaction. Tell them when you’d like them to ask, and if you’ll have designated times for it.

# 2. Ask a great question at the beginning to get people talking
> When it comes to presentations, most of us are used to being talked to, rather than being asked to share our own thoughts. Opening with a question turns this idea on its head. You can ask the audience what they'd like to get out of the session or why they came. You can poll the group for their opinion about a topic.

# 3. Get people's opinion
> One evergreen rule of presenting is to know your audience. One way to do that is to ask them what they actually think. You can go so far as to point to a specific person and ask for their opinion (works best in a small group) or to query a portion of the room.

# II.give a confident and compelling presentation.
> Please note that, in our language of English, attention is paid because attention is a valuable currency. When listeners pay attention, they are rewarding you with arguably /'ɑrɡjuəbli/ [adv. 可论证地] the most valuable currency in the world.Here are some techniques that are guaranteed to earn you more attention without losing any of your professional credibility.

# 1. Start with the unexpected.  
> Start with a bang, not a whimper /'wɪmpɚ/ [n.平庸] . Smokers like matches that light with the first strike, and listeners like presentations that ignite interest with the first sentence.For instance: "We stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw and felt the worst of war."--President Ronald Reagan

# 2. Make it about them. 
> Now that you've gotten listeners' attention withyour magnetic /mæg'nɛtɪk/ [adj.有吸引力的] opening, make the story about them. Talk about their goals, their aspirations, their anxieties.

# 3. Get to the point. [直击重点]
> One of the great pleasures the audience has is quickly grasping what you're getting at. They resent [v.讨厌] you when you rob them of this pleasure.

# 4. Arouse emotion. [引发情绪]
> Humor is inherently /in'hiərəntli/ persuasive [自带说服力]. It gives the speaker an unfair advantage because it literally /'lɪtərəli/ [adv.确实地,真正地] changes the chemistry in the room, and in the brain of everyone present.

# 5. Write clear headlines. [列出清晰的关键句]
> Write headlines for your slides that express apoint of view[为每一页配一个关键句]. The audience will get the big idea and look at the body of the slide for evidence that supports your point.

# III.When Your Mind Goes Blank
> Imagine this scenario /sə'nærɪo/ : You’ve worked hard to prepare for an important presentation, panel /'pænl/ [小组讨论], or media interview. A lot is riding on your performance: – your company, and your own reputation. Then the big day comes, you walk into the room, and suddenly your mind goes blank … totally blank.Do you panic? Do you convey your fear? There are better ways to recover and get back on track.

# 1.Remember this swimming lesson rule: don’t panic
> Even when you are literally disoriented /dis'ɔ:rientid/ [adj.迷惑] and forget what you are supposed to say, the worst thing you can do is panic. Recall the swim lessons from your childhood. A panicking swimmer will find it more difficult to stay afloat /ə'flot/ [adj. & adv. 浮在水面(的)]. When you stay calm, you will recover much more quickly and easily.

# 2.Pretend you are in Las Vegas: keep a poker face
> Truth be told[说实话], mere seconds of silence can feel like an eternity when you are the focus of everyone’s attention[当你成为每个人关注的焦点时，仅仅几秒钟的沉默会感觉像是永恒]. Your own silence can feel deafening /'dɛfnɪŋ/ [adj.震耳欲聋的]. To your audience, however, those seconds are merely a pause. Unless you somehow indicate to your audience that you’ve lost your place or that your mind has gone blank, they won’t know!

# 3.Repeat, fast forward through, or glance at yournotes
> Jog /dʒɑɡ/ [vt.&vi.(使)慢走、慢跑] your memory by repeating the last thing you said (aloud or silently in your own mind) or by jumping forward to something else that you remember. If the point you forgot is important, you can later incorporate /ɪnˈkɔrpəˌret/ [v.把…合并] it in your presentation once that message comes back to you. Or, you can always bring up that message point during the Q&A.

# IV.grammer
# 1.transitional words
> The words that kind of help us to move from one thought or one idea to the next.

# 2.presentation/speech
> 1)Alright. So we're back. And Tim is giving his opening sentence, he says, "My name is Tim and I'm here to give a presentation on why English is important".OK. So presentation, we all kind of know what a presentation is. Presentation, when I see this word, I think about PowerPoint, introducing something.Like in meeting, someone is always, you know, they're using their computer to show us maybe some pictures or just other things up on a big screen.

> 2)So a speech is just when you're talking.

# 3.comes to mind
> It just means what do you think of?

# 4.as you may know [phr.或许你们知道]
>  So as you may know, we often put this before some kind of information or statistic that we're giving our audience.Because maybe they know that already.A lot of people probably do know that but someone.Yes. So you'll hear this often in the presentation. Pretty formal, isn't it?

# 5.graph
> Right. There are many different kinds of graphs. But they always show like numbers or things, right? If they are going up or going down. The common one is the pie chart.That's good that you said chart, because basically when we're giving presentations, you could say graph, you could say chart, they're pretty much the same thing.Basically yes, and, and when we give these presentations they're usually on a slide.

# 6.significantly
> Right. This is a really great word to use in your presentation. Significantly. It means a lot.A lot, yeah. But there are a few really important, there are useful phrases that we use it in, like for example, numbers significantly reduced.Yeah. It's usually about numbers going up or down.Right. Here we have increased. You could say decreased or reduced like Connor just said. But really just any kind of change.

# 7.in other words
> So in other words, great phrase. You kind of want to repeat yourself, but of course you can't say the same thing twice, so you just decide to use other words.Yeah. In other words, saying it a different way, usually a little more simply, right?

# 8.opens up [phr.打开]
>  In other words, saying it a different way, usually a little more simply, right?Yeah. And that's simple way to say that is that it opens up many professional opportunities.OK. So let's use our brains for a second here, opportunities can be thought of as doors.

# 10.what's more
> It really just means furthermore.Yeah. Furthermore. Now the problem is in daily speech we don't really say furthermore very much, do we?It's too fancy, right? So we could say what's more, it's just like saying, "Oh, in addition to that, not only that".

# 11.require/need
> which means a need.And are there really any other differences between require and need?

> require.Not really. It's also a little more formal things, like what you required to get into university.

# 12.broaden your mind/horizon.
> I think so too. Exactly, yes. So broaden your mind, it's kind of like making it bigger.Right. If something is broad, it means that it is wide.

> It's wide. Exactly. So we use this phrase, broaden your mind. We also say broaden your horizon.Yeah. Don't be that frog in the well, you want to be the frog, look at the wide wide sky, the horizon.
