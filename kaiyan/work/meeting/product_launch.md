# 1.Water-related metaphors about the economy
## 1)make a big splash
> means to really get people’s attention, like someone jumping into the water.

- The movie failed to make a big splash [The movie did not receive much attention].[电影没能引起注目。（电影没什么关注度）]

## 2)prime the pump
> means to get ready or prepare.

- We don’t have the liquidity to make that big of an acquisition [We don’t have the cash].[我们手上没有流动资金做那么大的收购。（我们没钱]

- The company became insolvent shortly after the merger [The company started to fail financially].[公司在并购后很快就资不抵债了。（公司的财务状况无法支撑下去)]

- Lately, the market has been flooded, so the price has remained low[There is an excess of products on the market].[最近市场供应充足，所以物价一直很低。（市场上供大于求）]

# 2.theater-related expressions
> The speakers in today’s dialogue are planning to release a new product into the world. However, they aren’t thinking of the product release as just some kind of boring or everyday event; they are thinking of it in terms of spectacle and theater. For example, one of the speakers says that they want to leave the curtains closed a bit longer, meaning that they don’t want any information to leak. 

> The reason for that is, when you raise the curtains, the show begins, whether or not the actors (or in this case, the executives) are ready.“Pulling back the curtains” means to reveal more than was originally shown. Similarly, when the curtains close, the show is over: so when we say “bring down the curtain” on something, we mean it’s time to end it.

- 1. I want to keep the curtains closed a bit longer: we want to build more hype.[我想对细节再保密一段时间，来营造更多期待]

- 2. We pulled back the curtain to reveal the real criminals in the case.[我们揭开谜团，揭晓谁是案件中真正的嫌犯]

# III.grammar
***I'm sure everyone in this room is excited about launching our new product. I've called this meeting to make sure we're all on the same page to deliver a successful launch. Dan is going to lead the meeting today with a launch plan.***

***Thanks, Jim. I'd like to start by saying that I believe we have a superior product on the market. We've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback from focus groups and seed users. Our priority now is to make sure that we plan and execute the launch to maximize the impact and return for our company.***

***Right. The launch is critical to the future of our company. Many see a product launch as just an event that makes a big splash. But I'd like to approach it as a holistic process.***

***To expand on what Jim just said: the launch is a process that has its own life cycle. I'd like to highlight a few key things here. First and foremost, the launch needs to build sales momentum.***

***Absolutely. That all starts with having a product that meets a concrete market need. And we've already validated that.***

***Yes. And it takes me to my next point, which is that we need to develop a crystal-clear position and message. It needs to communicate both the benefit of our product and also how it's going to help solve users' problems.***

***That's right. Now I don't want our messaging to be bogged down by features and functions of the product. It needs to reinforce the value of the product for the user.***

***We also need to set clear targets and goals for what needs to be done. I've prepared a launch status report. Let's work off the list and more importantly, measure results and adjust our steps accordingly.***

***Have you sent out the report to everyone at the table?***

***Yes, I have. And I'll talk to each department head in the following week to make sure we deliver.***

***Sounds great. Now, general principles aside, I'd like us to really get started priming the pump. That is to say we need to start preparing both internally and externally to build excitement and create demand for the product before it hits the market.***

***Yes. Let's start with internal work...***

# IV.pattern
***Now, let's talk about the specifics of the launch. Dan, start with internal work.***

***Ok. The three main areas are: communications, customer support, sales and distribution. Elaine, I'll need a draft press release. Support: Jack,please give me a list of top 10 questions you might receive from customers and answers. Robin, we'll need a detailed plan of how you're going to work with our distributors on the launch.***

***And the deadline for these is Thursday, correct?***

***That's right. Thursday morning please, so that Jim and I have time to look at everything and work with you to finalize things by the end of Friday.***

***I know this might be a crunch. But I'm sure we can all deliver. And I appreciate all of you going above and beyond for the launch.***

***That's right. Now, I'd like to briefly touch on the actual launch event. This would be the first time where we hold a physical launch event.Marketing has been working closely with an event agency on this. From what I've seen so far, I think it's gonna be a killer.***

***Yeah, I agree. But we'll leave the curtains closed for a bit longer. We want you to be wowed along with the consumers and press.***

***I just want to add that the launch will not only be a spectacular event for those who will be attending, we'll also be streaming it to our users and syndicating it on few targeted media outlets.***

***With that, I hope everyone is feeling pumped about the launch and our future. We've been working very hard on the new product and it's about time to unveil it to the world.***
