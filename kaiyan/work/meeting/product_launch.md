# I. Steve Jobs 
> Generating buzz for your product launch is never easy. For every Steve Jobs launching the iPhone, there are dozens if not hundreds of unknown people who tried to launch forgotten products. Here are a few tips to make sure that you and your product remain on the successful side of product marketing history. First, get the media on your side. 

> It’s one thing to have a good social media presence, but you are still going to have to rely on other forms of media (newspapers, magazines) to get people talking about your product. Second, don’t make your launch only about the product: make it about the people using it. 

> Most people don’t care about the technical aspects of the product: they want to know how it will change their life. Finally and perhaps most importantly, the product launch is an event. An event isn’t just some boring thing happening on some ordinary day: it needs to be BIG. Even if you don’t have the kind of money that a company like Apple can pour into a launch event, find a way to use your resources so that you can maximize the impact of the launch and make it something to remember. 

> Not everyone can be Steve Jobs, but if you follow these steps, you’ll be well on your way to creating not just a product that people will want to use, but an event that people will be talking about well into the future.

> So far in this series, we’ve touched on generating buzz and creating a spectacle. It is worth keeping in mind, however, that, when you are focused on the spectacle, it may be easy to overlook the more humdrum aspects of the product launch. One such example is the positioning statement: both a clear and concise description of your product’s target market, as well as the compelling picture of how you want the market to perceive your brand, it one of these sometimes-forgotten, but absolutely essential aspects. 

> Although the positioning statement may seem dry or boring, but it can keep you and your products grounded. Cornell University provides a template to help brands create effective positioning statements [from blog. ecornell.com]: For [insert Target Market], the [insert Brand] is the [insert Point of Differentiation] among all [insert Frame of [insert Frame of Reference] because [insert Reason to Believe]. The point of differentiation (POD) describes how your brand or product benefits customers in ways that set you apart from your competitors. The frame of reference (FOR) is the segment or category in which your company competes. 

> The reason to believe is just what it says. This is a statement providing compelling evidence and reasons why customers in your target market can have confidence in your differentiation claims. 

> The wording of your positioning statement doesn’t have to match this template exactly, but to be effective, it must contain the five main components in brackets above.Occasionally, a positioning statement will contain a point of parity, when it is central to a product’s positioning. 

> Remember that in the end, your positioning statement has two audiences: of course, it must reach the public, who ultimately will decide whether your brand is successful. It must also, however reach its second audience, which is your company. This is not just an advertising document: this is something that will keep you grounded and focused throughout the buzz and the spectacle.

# 2.theater-related expressions
> The speakers in today’s dialogue are planning to release a new product into the world. However, they aren’t thinking of the product release as just some kind of boring or everyday event; they are thinking of it in terms of spectacle and theater. For example, one of the speakers says that they want to leave the curtains closed a bit longer, meaning that they don’t want any information to leak. 

> The reason for that is, when you raise the curtains, the show begins, whether or not the actors (or in this case, the executives) are ready.“Pulling back the curtains” means to reveal more than was originally shown. Similarly, when the curtains close, the show is over: so when we say “bring down the curtain” on something, we mean it’s time to end it.

# III.grammar
***I'm sure everyone in this room is excited about launching our new product. I've called this meeting to make sure we're all on the same page to deliver a successful launch. Dan is going to lead the meeting today with a launch plan.***

***Thanks, Jim. I'd like to start by saying that I believe we have a superior product on the market. We've gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback from focus groups and seed users. Our priority now is to make sure that we plan and execute the launch to maximize the impact and return for our company.***

***Right. The launch is critical to the future of our company. Many see a product launch as just an event that makes a big splash. But I'd like to approach it as a holistic process.***

***To expand on what Jim just said: the launch is a process that has its own life cycle. I'd like to highlight a few key things here. First and foremost, the launch needs to build sales momentum.***

***Absolutely. That all starts with having a product that meets a concrete market need. And we've already validated that.***

***Yes. And it takes me to my next point, which is that we need to develop a crystal-clear position and message. It needs to communicate both the benefit of our product and also how it's going to help solve users' problems.***

***That's right. Now I don't want our messaging to be bogged down by features and functions of the product. It needs to reinforce the value of the product for the user.***

***We also need to set clear targets and goals for what needs to be done. I've prepared a launch status report. Let's work off the list and more importantly, measure results and adjust our steps accordingly.***

***Have you sent out the report to everyone at the table?***

***Yes, I have. And I'll talk to each department head in the following week to make sure we deliver.***

***Sounds great. Now, general principles aside, I'd like us to really get started priming the pump. That is to say we need to start preparing both internally and externally to build excitement and create demand for the product before it hits the market.***

***Yes. Let's start with internal work...***

# IV.pattern
***Now, let's talk about the specifics of the launch. Dan, start with internal work.***

***Ok. The three main areas are: communications, customer support, sales and distribution. Elaine, I'll need a draft press release. Support: Jack,please give me a list of top 10 questions you might receive from customers and answers. Robin, we'll need a detailed plan of how you're going to work with our distributors on the launch.***

***And the deadline for these is Thursday, correct?***

***That's right. Thursday morning please, so that Jim and I have time to look at everything and work with you to finalize things by the end of Friday.***

***I know this might be a crunch. But I'm sure we can all deliver. And I appreciate all of you going above and beyond for the launch.***

***That's right. Now, I'd like to briefly touch on the actual launch event. This would be the first time where we hold a physical launch event.Marketing has been working closely with an event agency on this. From what I've seen so far, I think it's gonna be a killer.***

***Yeah, I agree. But we'll leave the curtains closed for a bit longer. We want you to be wowed along with the consumers and press.***

***I just want to add that the launch will not only be a spectacular event for those who will be attending, we'll also be streaming it to our users and syndicating it on few targeted media outlets.***

***With that, I hope everyone is feeling pumped about the launch and our future. We've been working very hard on the new product and it's about time to unveil it to the world.***
