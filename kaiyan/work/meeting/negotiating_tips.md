# negotiating tips 
# I.A complete guide to BATNA
# 1. Coinage /'kɔɪnɪdʒ/ [起源] of the term BATNA
> Negotiation researchers Roger Fischer and William Ury, of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON)[哈佛谈判项目(PON)], are the pioneers of BATNA. They introduced it in their best-selling [畅销书] 1981 book, Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In[谈判协议的最佳替代方案]. BATNA—Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement—is your trump /trʌmp/ card [王牌] when the negotiation starts to turn unfavorable [不利]. It focuses on the psychology [心理] of negotiators. BATNA does not necessarily guarantee an agreement in your favor [不一定保证最终达成理想的协议], but it prevents the agreement from going against your terms[至少能防止协议走向对己方不利的境地].

# 2.Process of BATNA
> Clearly Define your Purpose. You need to understand what you are trying to get from the negotiation.

## 1)Brainstorming. [集思广益]
> You cannot begin without brainstorming all the possible alternatives [所有可能的备选方案] you can use during the negotiation.

## 2)Evaluation.
> Assess each of the options very carefully. Do some research about the options you have[现有的选择].

## 3)Setting the Reservation Point. [设置保留点]
> A reservation point is the breaking point of the negotiation. At this point the deal will no longer be profitable for you [在此刻交易将不再对你有利，谈判也无需继续下去]. Great negotiators never reveal their reservation point.

# 3.Importance of BATNA
> At times it is better to turn down the negotiation and look for another one. It can be nerve-wracking [伤脑筋] to walk away from the table [离开谈判桌会] if you only have one option. Having a strong [稳妥的] alternative to the current negotiation will help you walk away [全身而退]from a bad deal. Additionally[此外], when the other side [另一方] sees that you are ready to walk away, it can lead to them agreeing to your terms.[做好了退出的准备，有可能利于场上优势向己方发展.]

# II.MESOs in negotiation
> Multiple Equivalent Simultaneous Offers (MESOs) [同时提供多个等价条件] is one of the most powerful negotiation tactics because it is a covert /'kovɝt/ [adj.隐密的] information gatherer that leverages human choice, flexibility, and interest-based framing [利益导向型框架].

> MESOs equates to presenting multiple “package deals” [“一揽子交易”] at the negotiation table [谈判桌] and is seen as an excellent indirect information gatherer [有效的间接信息收集装置], conversation tool [对话工具], and storytelling platform [叙事平台]. MESOs is performed by simultaneously offering three package options that are of the same value to the proposer.

> This is in stark contrast to the typical single-issue negotiation tactic [单一问题谈判策略] in which one side presents only one package offer [一方只提出一种方案] and the bargaining stand off begins with little optionality to aid in the process [讨价还价的对峙一开始就缺少其他选项来促成谈判]. This old-school style is analogous /ə'næləɡəs/ [adj.相似的] to an arm-wrestling match [掰手腕] or tug-of-war [拔河比赛]. One side wins and the other loses.[一方获胜而另一方完败]

# III.grammar
# 1.I'd say/I would say
> the subjunctive /səb'dʒʌŋktɪv/ [虚拟语气词] "would" is used in the phrase "I would say" (I'd say). This phrase is a polite but friendly way to give advice.

> It's essentially a shorter version of "if I were to give advice, I would say this.[要是我来给建议，我会这么说]" In this lesson, it's used in a nominal clause (The biggest thing I would say...), but it's more commonly used before a conjunctive "that" clause (I'd say that you should…). Other nominative pronouns (we, they, etc.) are possible, but "I" is the most common.

> Aside from giving advice, the phrase "I'd say[要我说]" is also used to make guesses. For example: "I'd say there are about 100 people working for my company."

- 1. If you're feeling pretty tired, I'd say you should get more sleep. (advice)

- 2. The most important thing I'd say is to believe in yourself. (advice)

- 3. I'd say it will take about two hours to get there, but I'm not sure. (guess)

# 2.a rhetorical /rɪ'tɔrɪkl/ device [修辞手法] called the "rule of three."
> Saying things in groups of three [事情重复讲三次] gives the sentence a kind of rhythm [有一定的节奏感] that makes it pleasing to hear, easier to remember, and better to  [朗朗上口，便于记忆，说服力更强]. (Did you notice the "rule of three" in the last sentence?) For example, the phrase “location, location, location” is used in the real estate industry [房地产行业] to emphasize that location is by far the most important factor in determining a property's value. Also, on Apple's iPhone homepage, the slogan “Pro cameras. Pro display. Pro performance.” was prominently featured.[“摄像头、显示屏、性能，样样Pro如其名”。]

> The "rule of three" doesn't have to be the same word or phrase repeated. It can just be a group of related ideas [相关的想法]. For example, children are taught to "stop, look and listen" [一停，二看,三听] before crossing the street or a railroad [在过马路或铁路]. Advertisements also use this strategy to market their new products, such as "thinner, lighter, faster."

# IV.pattern
***Hey Taylor, I have a business deal coming up and could use some help with negotiating***

***Sure. The biggest thing I'd say is that negotiations don't have to be adversarial. Try to sympathize with them and know what their goals are.***

***Okay, I'll do my homework. But what if things do go south during negotiation?***

***You need to figure out the minimum outcome you'll accept, and if that isn't met, you need a BATNA ready.***

***best alternative to a negotiated agreement. Knowing you can walk away is your best friend in a negotiation.***

***Got it. And what about keeping it non-confrontational?***

***First off, no finger-pointing. Getting emotional will cloud your judgment.***

***Okay, so should I just be like a robot?***

***Not at all. Building rapport is essential. A little small talk will make them more collaborative.***

***Thanks. I'll try to remember that.***

# IV.pattern
***Hey, Carly. How's the prep coming along for your business deal?***

***Pretty good, but I'm still scared about not getting the best deal.***

***Remember that it doesn't have to be a zero sum game. Don't focus on making concessions and demands on a single issue.***

***Okay, so look for other trade-offs besides price?***

***Exactly. Get creative. And don't forget to listen, listen, then listen some more.***

***Okay, I'll make sure I paraphrase what I heard. What if my counterpart rejects everything?***

***Well, have you thought about MESOs?***

***Multiple equivalent simultaneous offers? Yes, but it's still so easy to get stuck.***

***Hmm, okay. Any other advice that helped you?***

***For sure. If you get bogged down, don't be afraid to take a break or postpone the meeting.***

***Wow, thanks. Can I take you to the meeting?***
