# I.hold effective meetings
- 1. State views and ask genuine questions. This enables the team to shift from monologues and arguments to a conversation in which members can understand everyone's point of view.

- 2. Share all relevant information to help the team develop a more comprehensive perspective.

- 3. Explain reasoning and intent to help team members understand how others reached their conclusions.

# III.pattern
***If you want your team to be effective in meetings, having meeting ground rules that you can consistently enforce is crucial.***

***Some ground rules are procedural, such as "Start on time and end on time". There are also abstract rules,such as "Treat everyone with respect" and "Be constructive."***

***These rules focus on a desirable outcome but can create problems if group members have different ideas about which behaviors are most appropriate.***

***Behavioral ground rules on the other hand are more useful. They describe specific actions that team members should take to act effectively, such as "explain your reasoning".***

***For example, instead of calling someone out, you can say, “Can you help me understand how your comment is relevant here, or can we figure out another time to address your topic?”***

***You may learn that your team member is thinking more systematically and has identified an important issue that no one else has thought of.***

***Raising concerns like this leads to a better team decision, better working relationships and reduced frustration for everyone.***
