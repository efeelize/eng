# hold_meetings
# I.most meetings waste time 
> In a survey reported in Industry Week, 2000 managers claimed that at least 30 percent of their time spent in meetings were not constructive at all. According to another survey, 25-50 percent of the time people spend in meetings is considered a waste. And according to another survey, 45 percent of senior executives said that their employees would be more productive if their companies banned meetings for at least one-day a week.

> A study by Microsoft and others studied the amount of time workers worked in an average day and week. It concluded that the average worker actually worked only three days per week or about 1.5 hours per day. The study identified that the rest of the working time was “wasted,” and unproductive meetings heading the list.

> In addition, a study by psychologist Kathleen Vohs found that workers have a limited amount of cognitive resources in a given day. By having meetings that run multiple hours, workers run out of their mental resources and meetings can become fruitless. Al Pittampalli, author of Read This Before Our Next Meeting, presents that traditional meetings create an unnecessary culture of compromise and kill our sense of urgency. He has a list of ways to have effective meetings, such as: only meet to support a decision that has already been made, and never hold a meeting for informational purposes.

# I.hold effective meetings
- 1. State views and ask genuine questions. This enables the team to shift from monologues and arguments to a conversation in which members can understand everyone's point of view.

- 2. Share all relevant information to help the team develop a more comprehensive perspective.

- 3. Explain reasoning and intent to help team members understand how others reached their conclusions.

# III.pattern
***If you want your team to be effective in meetings, having meeting ground rules that you can consistently enforce is crucial.***

***Some ground rules are procedural, such as "Start on time and end on time". There are also abstract rules,such as "Treat everyone with respect" and "Be constructive."***

***These rules focus on a desirable outcome but can create problems if group members have different ideas about which behaviors are most appropriate.***

***Behavioral ground rules on the other hand are more useful. They describe specific actions that team members should take to act effectively, such as "explain your reasoning".***

***For example, instead of calling someone out, you can say, “Can you help me understand how your comment is relevant here, or can we figure out another time to address your topic?”***

***You may learn that your team member is thinking more systematically and has identified an important issue that no one else has thought of.***

***Raising concerns like this leads to a better team decision, better working relationships and reduced frustration for everyone.***
