***So is everyone excited about our first project in the new year?***

***Of course! We had a great year last year. It's time to kick things off with a bang in the new year.***

***Agreed. Today we'll go over project objective, roles and responsibilities and project milestones. Ben, why don't you start with the project objective?***

***Ok. The new campaign is designed to increase the number of shares of our social media content. Over the past year, we managed to build a sizeable social media following. This year, we need to leverage that to reach more people.***

***Exactly. We'll need to come up with a few clear steps in order to achieve that.***

***The first step is of course research. Amy, I'd like you to look at the most successful campaigns in our industry and come up with top 5 things we should do in our campaign.***

***Actually, I think we should look beyond our industry and look at other industries that serve the same segment. It might give us some fresh ideas.***

***That's a good point. Now in terms of milestones, since it's the first time we're doing this type of campaign, we don't have any baseline data. Let's look at some industry numbers first to help us determine our targets.***

***Sounds good. Let's get started.***
