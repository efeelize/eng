# Participating in a meeting
# I.Tips on how to participate in a meeting
# 1.Be prepared
> Prepare for the meeting by reading the agenda and brushing up on what's going on. If you’re not sure what the meeting is about, ask someone so you can prepare.

# 2.Pick your battles
> If you disagree with someone, think before you speak. Don't show someone up if you can correct him later, even if the person is a subordinate or someone you don't like.

# 3.Contribute
> Don’t leave a meeting without contributing, if it’s appropriate. Take an opportunity to ask a question, make a comment or just lend your support.

# 4.Don't dominate
> Even if you have several valuable questions and comments that contribute to the meeting, don’t dominate the discussion. After you make a point, wait for others to chime in.

# 5.Soften objections
> If you see problems with ideas or proposals, try to frame your concerns in a positive way. Instead of telling someone he or she is wrong, point out the problem by asking a question. This gives the person a chance to show they have the situation covered, and covers you if it turns out you were wrong.

# II.grammar
# 1.“where (someone) is coming from” &“Where did you get this idea?”
> it’s common for speakers to say that they understand “where (someone) is coming from” to
express that they understand why someone thinks this way. In this case, the phrase“where (someone) is coming from”is metaphorical and refers to the ideas or feelings that cause someone to have a certain opinion. Similarly, speakers often ask the question“Where did you get this idea?” when they want to want to know the cause or origin of an idea.

> On the other hand, the phrase “where (someone) is going with (something)” metaphorically refers to the next point in a person’s argument/plan, the ultimate point they want to make, or the end goal in their plan. In today’s lesson, Annie said “I see where you are going with this” to show that she could predict the next points that Keith wanted to make in his argument.

- 1. I'm not sure where he's going with this plan. I guess we'll find out at the meeting.

- 2. I understand where he's coming from, but I have to disagree. In my opinion, there are better solutions to this problem.

- 3.We argued for an hour. I tried to explain where I was coming from but he just didn't understand.

# 2.had sb do sth [phr.让某人做某事]
> “Had” someone do something is a commonly-used expression to mean “made” someone do something.The tone is slightly more passive and less direct than “made” someone do something.

- 1. I had my son pick up his room after he made me messy.[我儿子让我很忙乱，我让他自己去收拾自己的房间]

- 2. She had the waiter bring my dish back to the kitchen.[她让服务员把我的盘子带回厨房]

- 3. Eileen had the doctor check her blood levels one more time, just in case.[艾琳让医生再一次检查了她的血液指标，以防万一]



where do you stand [phr.你对此持什么立场] & what’s your take [phr.对此你持什么看法] & where you are going with this [phr.你接下来要说什么]
>1)And this is an excellent phrase it just means like do you like it or do you not like it.you could imagine they always talk about drawing a line in the sand. Yes. Right you can stand on this side of the line means you're for something or you can be on the other side of the line and you are totally against it.

> 2)so what's your take on this just means what's your opinion? so imagine that same situation where there is a line in the sand and there are people standing over here on the one side and there are people standing on the other side well maybe you're standing far away just watching them you know. What's your opinion on this whole situation.

> 3)this is really interesting because we just talked about that phrase where you're coming from as you kind of understand someone's reasons but here just like Lisa says you kind of understand what their next point is going to be.so you know what a friendly competition is good because it increases motivation and to increase it further, well, you can add a reward.nothing motivates people more than rewards.

# 3.all for it [phr.完全支持] & I can see where you are coming from,but .... 
> 1)all for it: It's a phrase that you can use at work but you can also use it casually too. Yeah, so I could say like I'm all for going to the pub.Or another example like if the company wants to add a gym hey I'm all for. If they want to give raises to the staff I am all for that too.

> 2)so if he says I can see where you're coming from then he means that I can understand why you think that way. I'm thinking about your reasons I can understand your reasons now of course we do see that little three letter word after this phrase again "but". often this comes together.

- 1. I can see where you're coming from, but what would you suggest?

- 2. I can see where you're coming from but I don't agree.

# 4.engaging [adj.吸引人的;v.] & passive [phr.被动的] & ease [v.缓解]
> 1)engaging is a little bit formal,engaging the staff is a very very good goal to have especially when it comes to English learning but there is another goal here as well.

> 2) Now all on something like Facebook or maybe on Wechat, really the only way we can engage with the material like that on posts is just to like them. but your not really engaging.exactly again this idea of engaging means you're really you're having a kind of a back and forth communication. There is just more going on. when you learn from videos is pretty passive like you're listening it's fun it's enjoyable but you're not really using that information.if you have a teacher like a real life teacher you know maybe they can engage you a bit more because they can point at you and say like Lisa where do you stand ah…then you have to use your information you have to be an active learner.

> 3)ease always has that meaning of kind of like reducing or lessening pain. usually something terrible, Pain, pressure, stress. So one of those and easing fears of a communication you know what that can really help your confidence levels and confidence is really important when you're speaking to others.

# 5.inspiration & inspire & motivate &motivation
> 1)for some reason I'm thinking about the very famous inventor Leonardo Da Vinci, who was very very inspired by you know the human body and science and probably God in there too somewhere.

> 2)Right but we don't really know where his motivation came from, like maybe he made a lot of money doing that maybe that was his motivation the thing that actually made him move like you can study the human body you can study music and arts and that will be very inspiring. 

> 3)But then if you don't actually do anything about it, you're probably not motivated.

> 4)so motivation focuses more on the actual action but inspiration focuses on creativity and the desire to make something.

# 6.pass it along [phr.转交、传递]
> we always use this phrase pass it along with information or a message of some sort.so maybe like if I can't make it to a meeting right I'll tell Adam hey sorry I can't make it today and Adam will say. I'll pass it along. well it looks like Tim likes this idea, so he says I'll pass it along and see what head office says.So he likes it but he probably doesn't have the power to actually do anything about it. he is going to pass it along he's going to give the message to head office.

# III.pattern
***Ok, everyone. In today's meeting, I'd like to discuss promoting English learning at the office. Annie, where do you stand on this?***

***Personally, I'm all for it. I think we should introduce videos that will engage the staff and help ease fears over communication problems with clients.***

***Ok, and what's your take on this Keith?***

***Well, I think Annie made an excellent suggestion, but I think videos are a bit passive. They can teach us expressions, but we need more real application.***

***Ok, I can see where you're coming from but what would you suggest?***

***One option is to add online chats and quizzes with department competitions. A little friendly competition can increase interest and motivation.***

***I see where you're going with this. We could even give a small reward to the winning department.***

***Well, it's certainly a good idea. I'll pass it along and see what head office says.***

# III.pattern
***I’d like to start discussing the plan for the upcoming Pacific Northwest Health Care Conference.***

***As you know, this will be the first time we’ll have a booth on the exhibition hall floor, so we’re really trying to make a splash with the attendees.***

***What’s size booth we were able to get?***

***It’s one of the smaller sizes, unfortunately, so that won’t be working in our favor. But we’re going to make up for it.***

***What are you planning?***

***Our booth is going to be delineated into two spaces-an interactive area and a customer feedback area. In the interactive area, we're going to have mobile devices set up to allow attendees to try out our new app.This will be the focal point of the booth, with bright banners advertising that you can get a code for a week of complimentary use of the app if they sign up for our mailing list.***

***Alright. Feel free to use iPads from the tech department for that. You can contact the design department to get the ball rolling on creating banners. What about in the customer feedback area?***

***Well, we're going to have a few people onhand in the interactive area to answer questions and get feedback, but on the other side of the booth we'll have a dedicated area for networking with potential clients and answering questions more in-depth.***

***Good. Don’t forget that networking and getting sales leads was a main impetus for us signing up for a conference, so don’t neglect this section of the booth.***

***Of course. We’re planning on bringing some of our most knowledgeable staff with us to man that side of the booth.***

***Sounds good. Also, we still have a few thousand three-fold brochures from the Southern California Medical Professionals Conference in March. Can you use them?***

***I already checked them and decided that some key information was out-of-date, so I’ve had them updated and re-ordered.***

***Thanks for being so on top of the ball. Let’s check in again this time next week.***
