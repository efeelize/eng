# Take_meeting_notes

# I.Four tips to take meeting minutes effectively
> Here are some points to remember if you are to take down notes in meetings effectively:

# 1.Use pen and paper.
> Using pen and paper is less intrusive /ɪn'trusɪv/ and easier to use [便携易用] . Using a tablet, notepad or laptop while taking notes can create a wall between you and the person talking.It’s also easier to get distracted with all those browsing windows [浏览窗口] and other files in your device.

# 2. Learn shorthand./'ʃɔrthænd/ [速记]
> It’s not just for court clerks[[法] 法庭书记员]or secretaries. Shorthand is still relevant especially when you’re listening to a speaker who talks fast.It may appear daunting /'dɔntɪŋ/ [使人气馁的] at first, but like learning typewriting /'taɪp'raɪtɪŋ/ [n.打字] , shorthand is easy to learn.

# 3. Just highlight the key points.
> Plot /plɑt/ [v.绘制;标出] the outline of your notes even before the meeting starts. As the meeting rolls on [phr.继续前进], just fill in the important notes under each of the main points.

# 4. Prepare a written report immediately after the meeting.
> Don't wait for the day to pass. Prepare a written report based on your notes right away while everything is still fresh in your mind[要趁着记忆还鲜活].

# II.grammar
# 1.go hand in hand & hand in hand 
> 1)it is used to express that two or more things are closely associated，related,or linked.Note that when the phrase is placed between the two things, the preposition “with” must follow the idiom, e.g., “Poor health tends to go hand in hand with lack of exercise.” [要注意，如果该短语位于两个事物之间，其后必须加介词“with”。]So here we can say that knowing the purpose of the meeting goes hand in hand with being prepared, so...

- Economic success and job creation go hand in hand.

- Does money really go hand in hand with happiness?

- Prime location and high rent go hand in hand.

> 2)But there are other verbs we can use as well, like two companies, or two employees might work hand in hand.but that's also a little different, isn't it? It's kind of like working together, like, if two people are holding each other's hands, it's kind of like... Yes, they're linked, but it's like they support each other, you know, they work closely to do something together. 

# 2.pointers [n.指示、建议] & clarification [n.说明] & clarify [v.]
> 1）so basically a pointer is a tip, some advice.And I always think about like, pointing someone in the right direction. Like "How do you get to the mall?" "Oh, it's that way." Pointing towards the mall. That's what I think of when I think "pointer".

> 2)So "clarification" just means to be clear.so if you need, or you want clarification, you need something to be clarified.

> 3)So clarify is the verb. It can be used in a passive way, something needs to be clarified, but you can also use it in an active way, clarify something.

# 3.for one thing [phr.首先]
> 1)So here we have this phrase, "for one thing", and this kind of means like, well, one problem I feel like I'm having, or one thing I think I should talk to you about, it's kind of like, this is the first thing she wants to talk about, but there's probably other things she will also talk about.usually we don't say "and then the second or the third..." But when we do say "for one thing", usually, it's probably like the biggest problem or the most important thing that you think you should talk about. 

> 2)Just whenever you need to give a reason for something, you could always use this phrase.And I should mention that you can use this phrase to also start talking about good things, right?so maybe someone is asking, "Why should I go on a date with Spencer?","For one thing, he is an amazing actor."Right, and then afterward, you might say, "Oh yeah?" And say, "Oh yeah, he's also a great singer." Right?it's just- you're giving a reason for something.

# 4.cramming [v.匆匆忙忙做某事] & cram for a test & cram 
> 1) "cramming". So this is an expansion word today, or "cram" is an expansion word today, and this just kind of means to like, fit a lot of stuff into a small place maybe?
So, we might cram for like a test for school?So when we say "cramming for a test", it's like trying to remember or learn a lot of things in a short time. Basic, it's not really a good way of learning, right?

> 2)What's most important is the preposition, it's always the preposition. So for a test, you want to say you cram FOR a test, but when you're cramming, what you're doing is cramming knowledge into your brain, not FOR your brain, it's INTO your brain.

> 3)But not only do we just cram for tests, you can also like, cram actual things. So you could say, "How are you going to cram all of those boxes into that tiny car?"

# 5.schedule [n.] & schedule for [v.]
> 1)As a noun, a schedule is just basically how your time is decided, like to be used.In the way we see it in the dialogue is Stanley saying "make a schedule".

> 2)you can also use this as a verb.So you should schedule for turning in notes.or schedule something: schedule an appointment, schedule a meeting. You could schedule a deadline.lots of things you can schedule. 

# 6.summarizing [v.] & concise  /kən'saɪs/ [adj.简练的] & precise /prɪ'saɪs/ [adj. 精确的；明确的] & clear-cut [adj.清晰的]
>1）summarizing ：This is always important. Actually, it's a really important skill to have in life, in school, in work: Can you take information, lots and lots of information, find the main points of that information, and just get rid of all the other stuff?So if you read like a book, maybe the book is very long, and we don't need you to write the book again. We just need you to tell us the important things that happened, so that's like summarizing the story, right?

> 2) "concise", you also want to be accurate, but it's really just as important that you are short and clear, right? You just want to get something really really really... The phrase I want to use is "narrowed down". It's just, this is what it means.So basically when you're concise, you don't say a lot, you just say what's important and you say it in a very short way.

> 3)"precise", which basically means to be accurate. 

> 4)clear-cut:so clear-cut, it just means like, right to the point. You see it and you get it, it's easy to understand, right? So "clear-cut" just means, kind of just easy to understand. And here so, talking about a clear-cut format just means having like a clear-cut style, like a note style.

# 7.CON-
> a lot of these words that start with "C-O-N", you might think that they are pronounced /kɑn'saɪs/, like our friend Connor, but these words are almost always pronounced /kən/, /kən'saɪs/.Except for words like "conference" (/'kɑnfərəns/).

# 8.action items [n.任务项] & next steps [n.后续步骤]
> 1)So "action item" is kind of a buzzword, in my opinion, and it really just means like, task.Tasks, things you should do, or things that need to be done.The things I have to do. So really, action items are kind of like, it's something we would list, we would just write down in the notes, and they're tasks for people, basically.

> 2）and I will say here, I do think when we use this phrase or this term, "action items", I feel like we only really use it in a meeting. And then outside of the meeting. I kind of feel like you would just say, "Oh, my job this week..."“the things I have to do...”

> 3)So maybe next, a next step could help you to achieve an action item?I would say that most next steps are action items or would be action items, but not all of them.

# 9.purpose /'pɝpəs/
>  I am gonna try my best here to bite my tongue. The purpose of the meeting. Sometimes there's a good purpose to the meeting, you want to meet a new co-worker, or there's a big project that's coming. Sometimes you really want to know the "why" of the meeting.

# III.pattern
