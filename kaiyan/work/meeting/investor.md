***Jonathan, thanks for coming today; after receiving your investor deck and business plan, we’re eager to hear more about your company.***

***Mark, I'm thrilled to be here. Today I'd like to introduce you to the BetterBright: an industrial-strength lightbulb that uses no electricity! BetterBright's goal is to make the world a brighter place through environmental sustainability and radical innovation.***

***That sounds impossible. Do you have a working prototype?***

***We do - but let's not get ahead of ourselves. As you can see, the team behind BetterBright is a diverse group of engineers and biologists. The credentials of our team are unparalleled in the industry.***

***It’s an impressive team. Tell me about your target market.***

***Because this technology is so new and advanced, scalable production is only possible for high-end,industrial users. Our target market is industrial manufacturing sites, where energy costs and usage play a significant role in overheads.***

***What about competitors and barriers to entry?***

***Because we use a sophisticated, patented technology, barriers to entry are extremely high. Direct and indirect competition exist in other lighting solutions, but no other technology claims the same level of energy savings.***

***So, you feel you have a sustainable competitive advantage?***

***Yes. The team that developed this product is incredibly difficult to recreate, and the patents we have secured make BetterBright very difficult to replicate, and substitute technologies are rare.***

***Have you secured a previous capital raise? And what is the plan for the use of proceeds?***

***Previous capital raise included a startup infusion from an angel investor, but we are seeking an additional $50 million in VC investment for this round. The use of proceeds will go towards manufacturing infrastructure that will allow us to scale production to achieve full market penetration.***

***What is your exit strategy?***

***We expect that once sales show market viability, we will be acquired by a major energy conglomerate.***

***This sounds like a very promising opportunity indeed!***
