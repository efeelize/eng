***Hey, Alana. I haven’t seen you here since you started your new business. I guess you’ve gotten pretty busy.***

***Yeah, it’s great but there are a million little menial tasks that I get bogged down in, so I end up working late every day.***

***Have you tried applying the 80/20 rule?***

***You mean the Pareto Principle of the vital few and trivial many?***

***That’s the one. Don’t you agree that 80% of your results come from 20% of your work? The rest is not nearly as important.***

***In theory, yes. But it’s super hard to put it into practice. I would love to only focus on the most important 20%. The problem is there’s no one to pick up the slack.***

***I get it. But you should still force yourself to examine your time allocation and mental energy. Don’t let low-impact activities make you lose sight of the big picture.***

***You see, most people run into the temptation to clear up the small things first, but then end up busying themselves all day with those trivial tasks.***

***Yeah, I’m guilty of that.***

***I was too, but using the 80/20 rule has really helped me focus and upped my productivity.***

***Maybe if I do the same then I’ll have to come to the gym more often.***
