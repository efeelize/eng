# 80/20 rule
# I.Vilfredo Pareto and his 80/20 rule
> The Pareto principle [帕累托法则] (also known as the 80/20 rule) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes [仅有20%的变因操纵着80%的结果]. This principle was named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted [发现了] the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne [洛桑大学] in 1896.

> Vilfredo Pareto was born in Italy in 1848. He would go on to become an important philosopher and economist. Legend has it that one day he noticed that 20% of the pea plants in his garden generated 80% of the healthy pea pods /pɑd/ [n.豆荚] [80％的健康豆荚是从20％的豌豆植株产出]. This observation caused him to think about uneven distribution [不均匀的分布].

> He thought about wealth and discovered that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by just 20% of the population [意大利80％的土地仅由20％的人所有]. He investigated different industries and found that 80% of production typically came from just 20% of the companies. The generalization became: 80% of results will come from just 20% of the action.[80％的结果是由20%的行为导致的]

> While it doesn’t always come to be an exact 80/20 ratio [严格遵从二八比例], this imbalance is often seen in various business cases:

- 20% of the sales reps [推销员] generate 80% of total sales.

- 20% of customers account for 80% of total profits.[20%的客户带来80%的总收益]

- 20% of the most reported software bugs cause 80% of software crashes.

# III.pattern
***Hey, Alana. I haven’t seen you here since you started your new business. I guess you’ve gotten pretty busy.***

***Yeah, it’s great but there are a million little menial tasks that I get bogged down in, so I end up working late every day.***

***Have you tried applying the 80/20 rule?***

***You mean the Pareto Principle of the vital few and trivial many?***

***That’s the one. Don’t you agree that 80% of your results come from 20% of your work? The rest is not nearly as important.***

***In theory, yes. But it’s super hard to put it into practice. I would love to only focus on the most important 20%. The problem is there’s no one to pick up the slack.***

***I get it. But you should still force yourself to examine your time allocation and mental energy. Don’t let low-impact activities make you lose sight of the big picture.***

***You see, most people run into the temptation to clear up the small things first, but then end up busying themselves all day with those trivial tasks.***

***Yeah, I’m guilty of that.***

***I was too, but using the 80/20 rule has really helped me focus and upped my productivity.***

***Maybe if I do the same then I’ll have to come to the gym more often.***
