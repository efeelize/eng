# Aviod an awkward conversation with a foreigner

# I.Getting over the language barrier
> Here are five great tips for overcoming shyness because of a language barrier.

> Realize that only you care about your mistakes. Nobody else is analyzing your grammar. If it’s a big mistake, just keep talking and everyone will forget.

> Get comfortable with non-native speakers [非英语母语人士] first. Build your confidence by speaking English with non-native speakers.

> Build your understanding. Listen to podcasts, watch movies, and repeat.

> Improve your accent. Listen to poetry, podcasts, rap music. Record yourself and listen. When you hear your own mistakes, you can get better.

> Talk to yourself. You don’t need a listener to practice your speaking. Read an article or watch a movie then summarize it to yourself, or your cat.

# II.grammar
# 1.(it‘s)all good [phr.没事]
> 1)"All good." So all good is really like this expression. Because its so short and it just means that "you know what? It's fine, everything is good. "Yeah we often also say "It's all good". But it's just a little bit shorter, "all good."That's right. And we frequently use it to respond to apology.

> 2)We can also use this in a question. For example, "Are we all good? Are we all good to go?"Yeah yeah. Like "Are we ok?" "Are we ready?", right?

# 2.talk shop [phr.三句话不离本行] & shoot the breeze [phr.闲聊] & go have a chat
> 1)Basically when your talking shop, it just means that you're talking about work.

> 2)So "shoot the breeze" is the opposite of talking shop. Basically you are kind of just chatting in you, getting to know each other."Shoot the breeze", that's a little tip for you guys. But we don't really say shoot the breeze. It's just kind of a fun expression, it's kind of old.You'll see it a lot in like articles I guess?But most of the time we just say "chat", "go have a chat".

# 3.initiate /ɪ'nɪʃɪet/ [v.发起、开始] & initial [adj.] & take initiative [带头] & initiating 
> 1)So when you initiate something, you basically started. This is kind of the verb "born". 

> 3)we also say "take initiative". Like at work if you're the person who is kind of proactive, you want to like begin a new project, and you know, you go to your boss with the proposal. You're taking initiative. You're the first one to have this idea and start it.

> 4)Exactly. And so here "initiating" kind of means to start the conversation.

# 4.cultural barriers & language barrier 
> 1)A barrier just means like a wall essentially, right?Exactly. So it's something that is blocking you from connecting to the other person.Yeah. When there's construction on the road, there are road barriers. When there are huge cultural differences that prevent you from, like kind of… sort of understanding each other, that's called a cultural barrier.

> 2)sometimes there's a language barrier between generations.So like a lot of those slang words that younger people use is really confusing to the older generation.

# 5,let off steam [phr.宣泄情绪] & blow off steam 
> 1)Oh letting off steam. So this basically means that you're just kind of relaxing, you're getting rid of your stress.I just had a fight with my wife, and I need to go let off steam or something.Yeah or maybe you're just really stressed out so you need to let off some steam

> 2)Yeah we also say "blow off steam". It's kind of the same. And it's when you're... like you have this sort of emotion inside. It could also be anger, when you're really angry.

# 6.looking over our shoulders 
> 1)so this is kind of straight forward. You know, if you're sitting at your desk, you can imagine sometimes the manager walks by to check, to check if you're doing your work. And they're looking at your computer screen.

> 2)we also use this the opposite way. If I'm walking down the street and I think somebody's following me like a thief. I keep looking over my shoulder back to see if he is still there.

- And we've been looking over our shoulders ever since.[从那以后我们每天都要提心吊胆]

- So we didn't have anybody looking over our shoulder, we didn't have anybody telling us what to do, what not to do.[没有人替我们保驾护航]

# 7.when it comes down to it [phr.归根到底] & the bottom line [重点]
>  So "when it comes down to it", this is kind of a long expression is just a chunk, we always say it together like this "when it comes down to it". And it's just like the general idea.

# 8.vicious /'vɪʃəs/ cycle [phr.恶心循环]
> So this happens a lot. A vicous cycle is when one problem causes another problem, and that problem makes the first problem worse.Exactly. So it is like a repeating circle.

# 9.lossen up [phr.放松] & at ease [phr.放心] & put sb at ease
> 1）So "loosen up" is kind of the opposite of tense, you're kind of relaxed here?So to make loose your body, loose up your mind, we say, hey man loosen up, don't be so tense.That's right. And you can kind of think about it in a situation. Where you're kind of maybe loosening your tie, so you might be uncomfortable, loosen up by loosening your tie.

> 2）So when you feel like you have been put at ease, it means that you feel more relaxed and maybe your mind is not so troubled.So when you feel like you have been put at ease, it means that you feel more relaxed and maybe your mind is not so troubled.This is commonly used in the army. When the soldiers are standing before like their commander, captain, or whatever they're standing really still, they can't move. And then the commander of captain says "At ease. " Just means relax right?

> 3)And we don't really say make me at ease, just puts me at ease.for example, like parents or something like this. Knowing that someone is taking care of their child will put them at ease.

# 10.cold one [n.冰镇啤酒]
> A cold one, this is another way to say beer.Oh yeah. Just a cold beer. I mean you could say, it's something other cold thing, but generally this just means cold beer.

# III.pattern
***Hey Sam, thanks for inviting me out for a beer.***

***All good, man. We chat at work all the time, so I figured we could grab a beer so we don’t have to talk shop.***

***I totally agree. I think most of us don’t initiate because we’re afraid of being awkward.***

***Well, although there might be some cultural barriers, we’re just like everyone else. We want to talk about the same things.***

***And let off steam without our managers looking over our shoulders?***

***Exactly. When it comes down to it, we’re far more similar than different.***

***Good point. I think there’s also the language barrier as well.***

***That I can understand. Although, honestly, when we’re out having a beer, who cares about English grammar?***

***Haha, I see what you mean. But I’m so afraid of not communicating correctly that I don’t even dare to try. Then it becomes a vicious cycle.***

***Well, after a beer or two, you’ll loosen up.***

***Thanks, that definitely puts me at ease. So, how about ordering a cold one?***

***You read my mind.***
