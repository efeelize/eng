# I.Getting over the language barrier
> Here are five great tips for overcoming shyness because of a language barrier.

> Realize that only you care about your mistakes. Nobody else is analyzing your grammar. If it’s a big mistake, just keep talking and everyone will forget.

> Get comfortable with non-native speakers [非英语母语人士] first. Build your confidence by speaking English with non-native speakers.

> Build your understanding. Listen to podcasts, watch movies, and repeat.

> Improve your accent. Listen to poetry, podcasts, rap music. Record yourself and listen. When you hear your own mistakes, you can get better.

> Talk to yourself. You don’t need a listener to practice your speaking. Read an article or watch a movie then summarize it to yourself, or your cat.

***Hey Sam, thanks for inviting me out for a beer.***

***All good, man. We chat at work all the time, so I figured we could grab a beer so we don’t have to talk shop.***

***I totally agree. I think most of us don’t initiate because we’re afraid of being awkward.***

***Well, although there might be some cultural barriers, we’re just like everyone else. We want to talk about the same things.***

***And let off steam without our managers looking over our shoulders?***

***Exactly. When it comes down to it, we’re far more similar than different.***

***Good point. I think there’s also the language barrier as well.***

***That I can understand. Although, honestly, when we’re out having a beer, who cares about English grammar?***

***Haha, I see what you mean. But I’m so afraid of not communicating correctly that I don’t even dare to try. Then it becomes a vicious cycle.***

***Well, after a beer or two, you’ll loosen up.***

***Thanks, that definitely puts me at ease. So, how about ordering a cold one?***

***You read my mind.***

***I'm Carl. Good to meet you. What kind of field are you in?***

***Oh, I'm in project management at a multinational. My team is based in London, Beijing and LA.***

***That must be hard coordinating when your team members are on the other side of the planet. I mean the timezones alone must be a challenge!***

***Yeah, and that's not the half of it. There are linguistic and cultural barriers as well.***

***I bet. How do you get around that?***

***Well, English being a lingua franca helps a lot, but the company also stresses getting to know our team personally.***

***That's good considering you don't get real face time with colleagues. Those exchanges are really important.***

***They really are, I'm finding. That is one of the downsides of collaboration like this: It's so easy to fall into this "us" and "them" attitude.***

***I can imagine. That can creep in and kill team spirit even when you're in the same office.***

***Right, so we have to be extra dedicated and focus on the positives, which far outweigh the cons***

***Oh, in what sense?***

***Well, working across different geographies lets you expand your horizons.***

***Hmm, that's a good point. You could say global teams have much more global knowledge.***
