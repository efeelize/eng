# I.Getting over the language barrier
> Here are five great tips for overcoming shyness because of a language barrier.

> Realize that only you care about your mistakes. Nobody else is analyzing your grammar. If it’s a big mistake, just keep talking and everyone will forget.

> Get comfortable with non-native speakers [非英语母语人士] first. Build your confidence by speaking English with non-native speakers.

> Build your understanding. Listen to podcasts, watch movies, and repeat.

> Improve your accent. Listen to poetry, podcasts, rap music. Record yourself and listen. When you hear your own mistakes, you can get better.

> Talk to yourself. You don’t need a listener to practice your speaking. Read an article or watch a movie then summarize it to yourself, or your cat.

# I.





# II.grammar
# 1.(it’s)all good [phr.没事]
> 1)"All good." So all good is really like this expression. Because its so short and it just means that "you know what? It's fine, everything is good. "Yeah we often also say "It's all good". But it's just a little bit shorter, "all good."That's right. And we frequently use it to respond to apology.

> 2)We can also use this in a question. For example, "Are we all good? Are we all good to go?"Yeah yeah. Like "Are we ok?" "Are we ready?".

# 2.semicolon [分号]
> 两句中间，连词省略时，用分号代替句号。一串分句中，如果分句内部有句号，则分句间用分号。分号位于两个由连词 连接的句子之间，如果第一句话中包含句号的话。两个主句中，如果第二个主句开头是需要由句号分开的副词 （however, in fact, therefore），那么两个主句之间也用分号。

# III.pattern
***Hey Sam, thanks for inviting me out for a beer.***

***All good, man. We chat at work all the time, so I figured we could grab a beer so we don’t have to talk shop.***

***I totally agree. I think most of us don’t initiate because we’re afraid of being awkward.***

***Well, although there might be some cultural barriers, we’re just like everyone else. We want to talk about the same things.***

***And let off steam without our managers looking over our shoulders?***

***Exactly. When it comes down to it, we’re far more similar than different.***

***Good point. I think there’s also the language barrier as well.***

***That I can understand. Although, honestly, when we’re out having a beer, who cares about English grammar?***

***Haha, I see what you mean. But I’m so afraid of not communicating correctly that I don’t even dare to try. Then it becomes a vicious cycle.***

***Well, after a beer or two, you’ll loosen up.***

***Thanks, that definitely puts me at ease. So, how about ordering a cold one?***

***You read my mind.***

# III.pattern
***I'm Carl. Good to meet you. What kind of field are you in?***

***Oh, I'm in project management at a multinational. My team is based in London, Beijing and LA.***

***That must be hard coordinating when your team members are on the other side of the planet. I mean the timezones alone must be a challenge!***

***Yeah, and that's not the half of it. There are linguistic and cultural barriers as well.***

***I bet. How do you get around that?***

***Well, English being a lingua franca helps a lot, but the company also stresses getting to know our team personally.***

***That's good considering you don't get real face time with colleagues. Those exchanges are really important.***

***They really are, I'm finding. That is one of the downsides of collaboration like this: It's so easy to fall into this "us" and "them" attitude.***

***I can imagine. That can creep in and kill team spirit even when you're in the same office.***

***Right, so we have to be extra dedicated and focus on the positives, which far outweigh the cons***

***Oh, in what sense?***

***Well, working across different geographies lets you expand your horizons.***

***Hmm, that's a good point. You could say global teams have much more global knowledge.***

# III.pattern
***Hey Janet! I'm glad you could stop by my office today.***

***No problem, Ben. I'm anxious to get started on brainstorming some ideas about how to manage our new remote team.***

***Let's familiarize ourselves with everyone and their locations. I have Dan and Lisa in Chicago and Justin and Larry from Miami working in marketing.***

***For the sales department I will be managing Scott and Dora from Los Angeles, as well as Natalie and Jessica from New York.***

***Okay, I believe the first thing we need to do is get better acquainted with our team members. I think we should call each of them individually to welcome them to the team.***

***I agree. This will allow us to get a feel for their personalities and how they interact with us. What do you think our next step should be?***

***We need to have regular meetings in order to keep everyone updated on the status of projects, go over any issues or concerns, and to get feedback from everyone on the team. It may be a challenge to coordinate something with everyone located in different time zones. Do you have any suggestions?***

***Let's do it through a webinar which would allow us to set a particular time for the meeting and give everyone an access code and teleconference number.***

***Sure. We should also send a summary email after each webinar to make sure everyone is clear on the action items and what they are each responsible for. But how do we monitor team member's daily activities and their utilization?***

***Well I don't think we should focus on micromanaging people's daily activities since they work remotely. Instead, we should focus on the results and make sure we give them clear targets early on.***

***That makes sense. But I do think measuring productivity is important. Let’s look at some software that would help us do that.***

***Right. We must also make sure that we are available to our team in case of important questions or emergencies. Let's plan to keep ourselves logged in on Skype and check our emails for a few extra hours a day. Otherwise, we might lose a day because of time zone issues.***

***Yes. I’d also like to propose weekly one-on-ones with the team members early on to develop a close working relationship and help us catch problems before they escalate. This will also help us determine whether the team members are up to speed or if they need additional training.***

***Agreed. We've come up with some really good ideas so far. Let's go ahead and get started on what we've discussed today.***
