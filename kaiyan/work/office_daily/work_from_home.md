Work from home
# I.Working from home: the pros and cons
> Many people are dreaming of working from home. However, in a Stanford study, 50% of home-based workers asked to return to the office. Here are a few pros and cons of working at home to consider.

# 1.pros
> You'll have greater flexibility. Working at home allows you to adjust your schedule from day to day. Of course, many appreciate the flexibility for more practical reasons[现实原因]: to provide childcare or eldercare [在家照顾孩子和老人] or simply to be at home when the plumber shows up.

> You'll save money. Commuting costs go away[通勤零成本]. Your professional wardrobe goes seriously downscale. Whether you're a business owner or an employee, there are incidental costs to showing up at work five days a week that disappear when you stay home.

# 2.Cons
> Staying motivated isn't easy[很难保持积极性]. Are you an extrovert /ˌɛkstrə'vɝt/ [n.性格外向的人] who thrives on collaborating with others on projects? Do you get energy and inspiration from the kind of impromptu /ɪm'prɑmptu/ [adj. & adv.事先无准备(的), 临时(的)] socializing that occurs among colleagues? If so, the solitary /'sɑlətɛri/ [/'sɑlətɛri/ ] nature of working from home might drain rather than augment your energy.

> There are distractions. Your home circumstances might have built-in distractions. These might include family members or roommates around the house. In any case, if you can't set aside time to devote to work and only work, you can't pull this off.

# II.grammar
# 1.as though
> 1)"As though," along with it's cousin "as if," is a phrase that is very difficult to explain, but very easy to use. It means "as would be the case if," but it's almost easier to understand it as "like."

> 2)we see the phrase "I'm still dressing as though I were going to work." The person is not going to work, but they are dressing like they are going to work.

> 3)When you hear native speakers use this phrase, you will hear a lot of different verb tenses. It's quite common to hear people say "as though I am," but it's also common to hear people say "as though I were." The latter is an example of the subjunctive mood [虚拟语气] in English, something that signals a more advanced level of speaking. And it describes an unreal or improbable situation.
