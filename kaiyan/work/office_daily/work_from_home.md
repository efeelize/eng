Work from home
# I.Working from home: the pros and cons
> Many people are dreaming of working from home. However, in a Stanford study, 50% of home-based workers asked to return to the office. Here are a few pros and cons of working at home to consider.

# 1.pros
> You'll have greater flexibility. Working at home allows you to adjust your schedule from day to day. Of course, many appreciate the flexibility for more practical reasons[现实原因]: to provide childcare or eldercare [在家照顾孩子和老人] or simply to be at home when the plumber shows up.

> You'll save money. Commuting costs go away[通勤零成本]. Your professional wardrobe goes seriously downscale. Whether you're a business owner or an employee, there are incidental costs to showing up at work five days a week that disappear when you stay home.

# 2.Cons
> Staying motivated isn't easy[很难保持积极性]. Are you an extrovert /ˌɛkstrə'vɝt/ [n.性格外向的人] who thrives on collaborating with others on projects? Do you get energy and inspiration from the kind of impromptu /ɪm'prɑmptu/ [adj. & adv.事先无准备(的), 临时(的)] socializing that occurs among colleagues? If so, the solitary /'sɑlətɛri/ [/'sɑlətɛri/ ] nature of working from home might drain rather than augment your energy.

> There are distractions. Your home circumstances might have built-in distractions. These might include family members or roommates around the house. In any case, if you can't set aside time to devote to work and only work, you can't pull this off.

# II.grammar
# 1.as though
> 1)"As though," along with it's cousin "as if," is a phrase that is very difficult to explain, but very easy to use. It means "as would be the case if," but it's almost easier to understand it as "like.""As if" is almost easier to understand. Because this really is just an "if" situation. 

> 2)we see the phrase "I'm still dressing as though I were going to work." The person is not going to work, but they are dressing like they are going to work.

> 3)One thing that we really do want to focus on is the tense of the verb that goes after.When you hear native speakers use this phrase, you will hear a lot of different verb tenses. It's quite common to hear people say "as though I am," but it's also common to hear people say "as though I were." The latter is an example of the subjunctive mood [虚拟语气] in English, something that signals a more advanced level of speaking. And it describes an unreal or improbable situation.

> 4)In the dialogue, we see the word "were." "I am dressing as though I were..." Don't ask too many questions about this. This is the smart-person way to say it.But you'll also hear "As if I was..." And you'll even hear people say, 'I'm doing it as though or as if I am going to work."So there's more than one way to use it.

- 1. I feel as though I've become a new person.

- 2. Our little dog is so cute! He always looks as though he were smiling.

- 3. You should always dance as if no one were watching.

# 2.working form home & working at home 
> 1) usually "working from home" is a more temporary situation.

> 2) "working at home" is more permanent. Now, that's not all the time, but that's just the sense that these phrases can give other people.

# 3.remotely [adv.远程的] & virtual /'vɝtʃuəl/ meetings 
> 1)it just means you're not in the city. You're outside of the city somewhere. It could be even far off in the forest somewhere.It's definitely far off, whether it's on a mountain or in the forest or at the bottom of the sea. Basically just means "from a distance and without any physical contact."

> 2)you can lock your doors remotely and unlock your doors. or you can even control another computer remotely through your computer. so these are words that we often use with "remotely," "control." In fact, there is a thing called "a remote control." That is a pretty common thing to have in your home.

> 3)"Virtual meetings." Yeah, almost anything we do online can be described as "virtual" something. Here in Vancouver, a lot of people that buy homes or apartments will first take a virtual tour. So someone will just take out their iPhone, and you know, I just give someone a look at this apartment.

# 4.roll out of bed [phr.起床] & commute /kə'mjʊt/ [n.通勤、上下班时间] & slobs /slɑb/ [n.懒散邋遢的人] & sloppy [adj.]
> 1)"roll out of bed" give me that impression of "I don't care what time it is. It's very casual. I just slept in for an hour."So, because he's not having to wake up early to travel to work, Jack can just kind of wake up anytime he wants.

> 2)a commute is just the amount of time it takes us to go from our house to our office and our office to our house.

> 3)Basically a slob is someone who's lazy and just kind of messy. If you stay in your pajamas all day, I mean you're kinda lazy. It doesn't mean you're necessarily messy, but people might still describe you as a slob. And Jack says, "At first, people were in their pajamas and relying on app filters /filtə/ [n.滤镜], but they're getting better."

> 4) We have an adjective form of this word, too, which is sloppy.

# 5.stay on track [phr.保持前进、保持进展] & keep on track
> 1) so "on track" basically means going in the right direction. you don't want to get off track. That means you're distracted. You're not focusing. It's kind of like the phrase we saw earlier, "to stick to it."

> 2)There's no difference. You can say both. "I had to stay on track. I had to keep on track so that I could get the job done."

# 6.phone it in [phr.敷衍了事]
> To phone something" basically means to make the least effort possible or to do something without any enthusiasm.But you can use this phrase whenever you're talking about your job. Maybe you're not really working very hard at all. "Jeez, Tom really phoned it in today."

# III.pattern
***Jack, I heard that you're working from home these days.***

***Yeah, the whole team has been working remotely for a while now.***

***Are you finding it easy to adjust?***

***Well it's nice to roll out of bed a bit later and not have to worry about the commute.***

***No doubt! Although I'd imagine it's hard to stay productive all day long.***

***It's easy to get distracted, sure. But I have my routine and I stick to it.***

***You probably don't have to worry about your physical appearance though, right?***

***I'm still dressing as though I were going to work. It helps me to stay on track.***

***A lot of workers must attend virtual meetings dressed like slobs.***

***At first people were in their pajamas and relying on app filters, but they're getting better.***

***I guess the lesson is, don't phone it in, even when you're phoning it in!***
