# Age_discrimination
# I.What is age discrimination in the workplace?
> Age discrimination is an adverse /'ædvɝs/ [不利的] work treatment of an employee based on a class or category that the employee belongs to—employees over age 40—rather than on the employee's individual merit.

> People who are age 40 and older are protected from employment discrimination based on age by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) [《雇佣年龄歧视法》(ADEA)] of 1967. The ADEA’s protections [保护] apply to both employees and to people who are applying for a job. Age discrimination is prohibited [禁止] in any term [条款], condition [条件], or privilege [特权] related to employment.

> Age discrimination is unlawful [非法] in any phase of employment including job postings, job descriptions, interviews, hiring, salaries, job assignments [工作任务], merit increases [功绩调薪], performance management and evaluation [绩效管理和评估], training, disciplinary actions, promotions, demotions, benefits, employment termination, and layoffs.

> Any action that an employer takes that adversely affects [不利影响] a disproportionate [不成比例] number of employees over 40 is also age discrimination. In fact, according to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), [美国平等就业机会委员会(EEOC)]" the ADEA allows employers to favor [优待] older workers [年长员工] based on age even when doing so adversely affects a younger worker who is 40 or younger."

> 3) my dad is pushing 70 at this point, so he is an old geezer /ˈɡizɚ/ [n.老家伙].Now my dad just turned 80, we don't say “he pushed 80”, We just say he turned eighty.

# 6.ageism /'edʒ'ɪzəm/ & age discrimination [n.年龄歧视] & prejudice /'prɛdʒədɪs/ [n.成见,偏见] & ageist [adj.年龄歧视者]
> 1) so ageism is something that basically every company, every industry runs into regarding their workforce.it's age discrimination, but the kind of new word for that is called ageism.so age discrimination became illegal in 1967, as Ben says here. Actually like the gender and racial discrimination, that was like 12 years before that. So this took a long time to happen.so it sounds like before that workers as early as 45 could be fired.

> 2)we already have racism, sexism, we needed more "-ism"s.it is just any kind of philosophy or practice and these are bad things, you've got like professionalism, that's a good thing. it's hard to say that all "-ism"s are bad, a lot of people will make that claim,anything that is an "-ism" or ends with an "-ism" is bad, but exactly, professionalism, patriotism /'petrɪətɪzəm/ [n.爱国主义] is a good one.

> 3)So there are many kinds of discrimination, there is gender discrimination, racial discrimination. It's when you don't treat someone a certain way because you have some beliefs, usually negative about the person.

> 4)Prejudice, which is very related, Now prejudice is more about your attitude,your beliefs, your thoughts, you know, I believe that younger people are better than older people.and those prejudices, they lead to discrimination.

# 8.counterparts [n.对应的人或物]

# 9.yikes 
> it just means wow,but I think it’s usually for negative things, like...you would say "Hey Connor, I won the lottery." I'm not gonna say yikes, I'm gonna say:" Well cool!" Maybe I could say like:" Oh, Connor, I went to the casino and I lost, you know, all of my lottery winnings." That's when you'd say yikes.

***Hey, Ben. Did you see all the fresh recruits HR just hired?***

***Yeah. They look really ... young.***

***Haha, tell me about it. I'm not accusing anybody of ageism, but it seems like half our workforce is under 30.***

***I agree. I'm only pushing 40 and already feeling like an old geezer around here.***

***Well, at least they can't let us go for us being too old?***

***Once upon a time, companies could do that, actually. We only got the ban on age discrimination in 1967. Before that, companies fired workers as early as 45 to replace them with more youthful counterparts.***

***Yikes! 45!? My poor grandparents! Well, we've come a long way.***

***You could say that, but even Mark Zuckerberg once said that young people are just plain smarter.***

***Wow, that's just so wrong. You know, I bet these ageist ideas creep in from our own culture.***

***Probably. I heard about a guy who wants to change his legal age from 69 to 49 because he can't find any Tinder dates.***

***Hmm, well I'm not sure that's the answer, but if society just won't accept him, I can see why he would resort to that***
