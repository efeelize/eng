# I.How to create a renovation plan to match your budget
> As a client, you may feel like you have little influence over whether your remodeling project [装修项目] stays on budget [符合预算] and hits the finish line on time [按时完工]. But you have more control than you might think.

# 1.Who will help you build your vision?
> Before you meet with a professional, you should know what you want to accomplish [装修期望]. Some homeowners know only that the current home isn’t working for them but aren't sure how to fix it [如何修整]. You may need to work with professionals who can help you develop a plan and advise you on cost.

# 2.What exactly do professionals do?
> The most important documents you will need are the construction plans [建筑计划]. Your building plans must be approved by an agency to make sure the home is safe and meets local codes [地区政府的通过]. So unless you are familiar with building codes [建筑标准] and construction methods [施工方法], you will want to hire a professional to draft these plans.

# 3.Be upfront [坦白] about your number
> It’s helpful to be honest about your budget with the professionals you contact. Professionals typically work with clients whose budgets are within a certain range [在一定预算范围内进行合作]. If you fall in love with a pro whose projects start at $50,000, but you have $5,000 to spend, you’re probably not a match.

# II.grammar
# 1.I’m more than + willing/happy/excited/ready/impressed
> 1)This phrasal pattern is used to express exceptional willingness or eagerness to do something, or the approval of something. It's most often combined with the adjectives "willing" or "happy," but can also be followed by adjectives such as "excited," "ready," or "impressed."

> 2)"I'm more than", and it's really common, it's really a polite way to say that you're flexible you know.You're willing to do something.

- 1. I'm more than happy to give you a helping hand.

- 2. I'm more than excited to meet your family.

# 2.renovating /ˈrenəˌveɪtɪŋ/ [装修] & renovations /ˈrenəˌveɪʃənz/ [翻新]
> so if you have a house, it's kind of old, or let's say your kitchen is old, you want to make it nice and new. So you don't just get rid of the whole house. Instead you go and renovate their kitchen.Those are called renovations.

# 3.squared away [phr.准备就绪] & still working on it
> 1)it kind of means finish dealing with something,so it's basically ready. It's OK to go.So you can square away things like a project or like an idea for a project at work. even travel plans like oh, did you figure out all your travel plans? I know we haven't gotten it squared away yet. we haven't bought the plane tickets. We don't know which hotel to stay at, nothing has been squared away. 

> 2)the opposite is I’m still working on it.

# 4.second thoughts [phr.重新思考] & think twice & cold feet
> 1) When you have a second thought, it means you have some hesitation.You're basically changing your mind.so you get worried and like I don't know if I should do this. So second thoughts, basically when you first thought about something, you thought it was a good idea. But now you're thinking I don't know if that's a good idea and that feeling of not being sure, those are your second thoughts. I mean they really may be your fifth or sixth or tenth thoughts, but they use a second thought.

> 2)if you're about to get married and you have some second thoughts. I don't know if I should, is this the right choice? That means you have cold feet.

# 5.unexpected [出乎意料的] & having concerns [担忧] & worried 
> So having concerns, it really just means that you're worried. It's almost a bit more formal than worries.It's not as strong as saying I'm worried about. This is just something that kind of makes me concerned. this is something parents kind of say in the west to their kid's lie. I'm just concerned if you hang out with those kids.You are going to get into trouble. so a boss might say to you: I'm having some concerns about your work.About your work ethic.

# 6.mutually beneficial & win-win [两全其美]
> 1)mutually beneficial is a really fancy-looking phrase,it just means win-win,it just means good for me and good for you.it just means good for me and good for you.So people can be mutually happy, like happy in a relationship.

# 7.postpone /poʊstˈpoʊn/ [推迟]
> it just means delay.You can postpone meetings. You can postpone a dentist, an appointment. the key thing here is you're not cancelling it, you're still going to do it, just later.

# 8.valid /ˈvæləd/ [合理的] & invalid /ˈɪnvəlɪd/ [不合理]  & propose /prəˈpoʊz/ [提议]
> if he had invalid concerns, it'll almost like be crazy and be talking nonsense. But here he's just worried, oh maybe it's a little expensive, He's concerned about the budget. I don't know if I really like the design that much. So valid concerns.and it does sound kind of like a a formal word, but we do use it like you could say it that's a valid argument or something.We say like arguments can be valid, a question can be valid, but also other things, like for example, a driver's license,or a ticket,the coupon.

- 1. I don't think that's a valid argument.

- 2. This coupon is no longer valid.

# 9.transparency /trænˈsperənsi/ [透明] & transparent [adj.透明的]
> 1)transparency：It means like basically if something is transparent, it's clear.so you can see through something if it's transparent, a physical thing, that's transparent.

> 2) if you have transparency about like business or plans, it means nobody is hiding anything from you. Everyone is clear on what is going to happen, how much things cost, things like that. there's no secret. So we use this word a lot, corporate transparency, or maybe there's a lack of transparency at a company.But here she wants to alleviate his concerns, so she thinks that being making everything transparent, providing transparency.

# 10.you can rest assured /əˈʃʊrd/ [完全放心] & in good hands  [可以放心]
> 1)you can rest assured :this just means you can relax,you don’t have to worry so much.

> 2)you're in good hands. This just means that you can trust the people that are working with you.you are well taken care of.A lot of people, for example, let's say, I feel like doctors will say this. you're in good hands. or even like the family, oh you have such a good doctor, don't worry you're in good hands.

# 11.strive /straɪv/ [争取] & strive for excellence/your best

# 12.alleviate /əˈliviˌeɪt/ [减轻、缓解] & aggravate /ˈægrəˌveɪt/ [恶化，加剧] & exacerbate /ɪgˈzæsərˌbeɪt/ [恶化，加剧]
> 1)alleviate just means to make something better, but maybe not totally fixed.it’s not like totally healed or if it’s actually pain,it’s just makes it a little bit less severe /sɪ'vɪr/ [adj.严厉的] . So this just means to make something a bit better.especially things like problems or pain, if you're sick, like alleviate your suffering.nd you said pain, so actual physical pain, like if you have a headache, you can, you know, maybe sleeping will help alleviate your headache.

> 2) The opposite of alleviate is probably like aggravate.or exacerbate.

- 1. Exercise can help you alleviate stress.
- 2. What can we do to alleviate her worries?

# 13.to propose [v.提议] & proposition /ˌprɑpə'zɪʃən/ [n.论点;主张]
> 1)so to propose is like to give someone an idea or a plan. to suggest something. So a proposal is kind of like when you make a proposal, it should be something that's actually mutually beneficial.if it's a job proposal or something. 

> 2) proposition, And there's a kind of a small difference but it doesn't always matter between proposition and proposal. If I work at a company and I have this new plan for a new product, that's usually called a proposal. Proposition is just like an offer.So there's like business proposals and business propositions.If you make a business proposition, it might be like "Hey, I have this job, you can do this job, and I'm gonna make more money than you, but you're gonna make some money too. What do you think?"
