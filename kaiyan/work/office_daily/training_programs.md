# Corporate training programs
# I.grammar
# 1.gamify [v.游戏化]
> 1)gamify is a verb and it comes from the noun, gamification. It’s a new term, coined in a few years ago. It means to adapt game attributes to non-game activities, such as education.[让游戏进入非游戏的领域，比如在教育领域使用寓教于乐的方式];

> 2)gamify means to turn an activity that is not a game into a game. So they can add some games to some of their learning programs.

- 1. I want to gamify our classroom material.

- 2. Can you gamify this activity?

- 3. The company gamified half of their corporate training programs, to see how people would react to it.

# 2.absorb & soaks up 
> 1)a sponge can absorb water.And your brain is like a sponge, it needs to absorb information and knowledge.

> 2) it can soak it up, which is a word that actually we see later on, but it's soaks up knowledge or absorbs knowledge.

# 3.cater /'ketɚ/ to 
> So when they say "cater to", they mean that, well, tools that have been specially made for these types of learners.Yeah, they work especially well for different types of learners. So if you cater to everyone's needs, it means you're making changes to help each different type of person, each different type of learners.you’re adjusting it.

# 4.instructional designer & instructional design & third-party solutions 
> 1)so an instructional designer is a person whose job..it is to create the training program. 

> 2)we also talk about instructional design, like how do you create the stuff. 

> 3)So third-party means that they're going to go outside of their company and find another company that specializes in making this sort of content.they're not going to do it themselves. They're not going to do it internally /ɪnˈtə..nəlɪ/ [adv.内部地]. And when they say solution they mean a solution for their training problems. so a company that can deliver the right material in the right way.

# 5.integrated [v.整合]
> so can the third-party solution be integrated into the learning management system of the company already has. So the company has some way of keeping track of which employees know what, what level of training they have. And they want the new third-party solution to work with that.to work well , to adapt well.

# 6.implementation [n.启用] & to run a pilot /'paɪlət/ [n.试用]
> 1)Implementation means how they start using it. So implementing the third-party solutions with the learning management system.

> 2) Now the plan is to first run some limited pilots. So to run a pilot means to let someone try it for the first time, just to see how it is. it's like an experiment. you're gonna test it with a few people. So limited pilots,not too many.

# 7.rolling it/something out & launching it
>  So, rolling it out is almost the same as launching it.to implement it across the whole company. So when you say roll something out, you feel that it's a big thing, right? It's not just a small scale test, it's a big operation.

# II.pattern
***Greg, my problems with our corporate training program are it’s too inconvenient; and it’s mostly classroom-based and paper-based with only a few software programs. That’s all outdated now.***

***Well, what would you suggest?***

***I recommend an app for an iPad or iPhone. And other features like videos, links, eBooks, forums, etc. We need a variety of online reference tools to help learners absorb knowledge quickly and conveniently.***

***Those are good ideas, especially since not everyone learns from sitting in a classroom all day. We definitely need lots of tools that’ll cater to all different types of learners.***

***We’ve received feedback in the past about how mundane the courses are. We have interactive whiteboards in our classrooms, but we aren’t taking advantage of all their capabilities.***

***We need to gamify some of our material; add fun games to our interactive whiteboards. Games will help the learners stay engaged and stimulated, so they can soak up the knowledge.***

***Yes, we definitely need to get learners engaged with the content. But I doubt our instructional designers have the skills to deliver that. That’s why I suggest we look at third-party solutions.***

***Do you have any recommendations?***

***I looked at quite a few. There are some good solutions out there. The key is that we choose programs that enhance the learning experience and effectively track performance.***

***Can they be integrated into our learning management system?***

***Many can. The implementation doesn’t seem to be that complicated. But I will need to get IT to take a closer look.***

***What about costs?***

***Many of these solutions have a subscription model. So we pay for the number of accounts we’d like to have. It will give us the flexibility to run limited pilots before rolling it out company wide.***

***Sounds like you’ve got a plan. For our next meeting, can you give me a detailed proposal for how you’d like to improve our training program? We’ll take it from there.***
