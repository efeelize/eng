# Type A personality
# I.Type A and B personality theory
> The type A and B personality theory is quite well-known both in the medical community [医学界] and pop culture[流行文化]. It was formulated by two cardiologists /'kɑrdɪ'ɑlədʒɪst/ [n.心脏病专家], Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman, during the 1950s. The research was originally conducted to investigate how different types of personalities can increase the risk of coronary /'kɔrənɛri/  disease [n.冠心病]. In psychology /saɪ'kɑlədʒi/ [n.心理学], this personality theory is mainly concerned with how people respond to stress.

# 1.Type A personality
> Type A individuals tend to be very competitive and self-critical[自我批判]. They are usually high-achievers and are in a race to achieve higher goals.[为了达成更高的目标而不懈奋进]

> Type A individuals experience a constant sense of urgency [总是处于紧迫感之中] - they seem to be in a constant struggle against the clock. They also tend to be easily aroused to anger [激怒] or hostility /hɑ'stɪləti/ [心怀敌意].

# 2.Type B personality
> Type B individuals are quite the opposite of Type A's. They tend to be more tolerant of others, are more relaxed, experience lower levels of anxiety [自身的焦虑水平更低] and display higher levels of imagination and creativity.

> Type B individuals sometimes are too relaxed and laid-back.[有时会过于放松，太过四平八稳] As such[就其本身而论], they may lack the drive [缺乏动力] to fully realize their career potentials.

> 1)if she does everything to a T and she's really focused on those details.OK, so she is a detail-oriented worker. She pays a lot of attention to detail. Maybe these kinds of people would be like good at design and something.Yeah or you know what most jobs cause a lot of jobs require a lot of attention to detail especially if you are in the office.But either way to do something to a T just means to always pay attention to little details and not miss any small thing.

> 2)Either way balance is important. You don't want to have be too much of one thing. But yes so she's super ambitious and she's a perfectionist she wants everything to be perfect.being perfect can be good sometimes, but you know what, it's not always possible and this can drive a person really crazy. I say most of the time things can't be perfect.So you gotta just gotta learn to let go.

# 6.touchy [adj.敏感易怒的]
> here it means to be sensitive like I can say something about you, and if you were touchy your feelings get hurt easily, you get sad easily.
