# Type A personality
# I.Type A and B personality theory
> The type A and B personality theory is quite well-known both in the medical community [医学界] and pop culture[流行文化]. It was formulated by two cardiologists /'kɑrdɪ'ɑlədʒɪst/ [n.心脏病专家], Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman, during the 1950s. The research was originally conducted to investigate how different types of personalities can increase the risk of coronary /'kɔrənɛri/  disease [n.冠心病]. In psychology /saɪ'kɑlədʒi/ [n.心理学], this personality theory is mainly concerned with how people respond to stress.

# 1.Type A personality
> Type A individuals tend to be very competitive and self-critical[自我批判]. They are usually high-achievers and are in a race to achieve higher goals.[为了达成更高的目标而不懈奋进]

> Type A individuals experience a constant sense of urgency [总是处于紧迫感之中] - they seem to be in a constant struggle against the clock. They also tend to be easily aroused to anger [激怒] or hostility /hɑ'stɪləti/ [心怀敌意].

# 2.Type B personality
> Type B individuals are quite the opposite of Type A's. They tend to be more tolerant of others, are more relaxed, experience lower levels of anxiety [自身的焦虑水平更低] and display higher levels of imagination and creativity.

> Type B individuals sometimes are too relaxed and laid-back.[有时会过于放松，太过四平八稳] As such[就其本身而论], they may lack the drive [缺乏动力] to fully realize their career potentials.

# III.grammar
# 1.Not all that  & never all that [不完全;不是特别]
> that mean "not completely" or "not very". Sometimes, speakers will remove "all" and just say "not that satisfied" but the meaning is the same. 

> 1)Not all that / never all that + adjective 

- I went to an amusement park on the weekend, but it wasn’t all that fun.[没那么有趣]

> 2)Not all that / never all that + many + countable noun 

- There weren’t all that many places to eat in the town.[镇上没有那么多可以吃饭的地方]

> 3)Not all that / never all that + much + uncountable noun

# 2.hyper- & hyper-organized [adj.非常井井有条的]
> 1)hyper means over or just very.we use hyper for a lot of different words like I could also say like hyper-energetic.Or like hyper-active.

> 2)in this situation right hyper-organized means a very organized person. when I look at this another like spoken way of saying this you could say she's super organized.

> 3)we use hyper for a lot of different words like I could also say like hyper-energetic.Or like hyper-active.And actually a lot of times especially for hyper-active kids, we might just call them hyper.Yeah that's true or you might be a little hyper after some coffee.

# 3.to a T [phr.追求极致] & perfectionist 
> 1)if she does everything to a T and she's really focused on those details.OK, so she is a detail-oriented worker. She pays a lot of attention to detail. Maybe these kinds of people would be like good at design and something.Yeah or you know what most jobs cause a lot of jobs require a lot of attention to detail especially if you are in the office.But either way to do something to a T just means to always pay attention to little details and not miss any small thing.

> 2)Either way balance is important. You don't want to have be too much of one thing. But yes so she's super ambitious and she's a perfectionist she wants everything to be perfect.being perfect can be good sometimes, but you know what, it's not always possible and this can drive a person really crazy. I say most of the time things can't be perfect.So you gotta just gotta learn to let go.

# 4.all that [phr.那么]
> that's the problem here that we're talking about because she is a perfectionist she wants everything to be great so she's not completely happy she's not all that satisfied.

> 1)competitive. So they compete with other people, they want to do better than other people.Yeah which is good, I mean like, you need some competitive spirit especially when you're like playing a game right?Like a sport and stuff, felt like at work you know sometimes it's not great for teamwork.but it's good if your company is competing against another company.

> 2）touchy： it means to be sensitive like I can say something about you, and if you were touchy your feelings get hurt easily, you get sad easily. One downside here of being a Type A or potential downside is being touchy. they might be a little bit sensitive, easily annoyed.so this touchy this doesn't mean to like touch things.

> 3)If someone is pushy, it means they make you do something, like a salesperson is pushy.we have this word here, "push." It just means to make somebody do something or try to make somebody to do something. So basically, a pushy person is someone who's telling you what to do. so if someone is pushy, bossy, they're rude, and they're trying to make you do something.

> 4)your boss might be bossy, but that's okay. But if they're your coworker, they shouldn't really be telling you what to do because a bossy person they give you orders. They're always telling you what to do.I'd actually argue that a boss shouldn't be bossy. It's a boss—I mean, their job is to tell people what to do, to give orders, right? But when someone is bossy, it usually means they're pushing you too much. They try to control you too much, t's a little more than you should be doing.

I don't wanna make it too confusing here guys, but just remember this word means "it is really easy to like."and we only use it to describe people. You couldn't say, "Oh! This restaurant is likable.

> 2)So, personable is a lot like likable, And if you're personable, it means you have a good personality. You're like a really nice and friendly person.so basically, if you're personable, it's usually like it's easy for people to come and talk to you, they are friendly. So, basically, when people are personable, they're easy to get along with.we say they have good people skills, and these kinds of people are really good in business. You know they can make people like them, and then people will agree with them and they'll do what they say or whatever.

> 3)if someone's "attentive," it means they pay attention. They listen to you. They observe you. They don't ignore you.

> 4)They can also be really attentive with their work, right? Not just with people, but when they're doing their work, they probably pay a lot of attention to details and stuff like that. 

# 7.obsessive /əbˈsɛsɪv/ [adj.执拗的] & obsess /əb'sɛs/ [v.迷恋] & obsess over [phr.着迷]

> 1)so laid back ,easy-going this all means like relaxed.And they're not, they don't care about perfection.For sure, often it means that they are like, they don't have as much stress.

> 2) So this just means like if you're a slacker you don't work hard. Your're probably lazy.

> 3)you're probably slacking off. So to slack off just means to not work hard. it's not work hard to maybe even procrastinate. 

> 4)so you're putting off that work. you have to turn it in on Friday and then you wait until Thursday to start doing it when you could have started it on Monday. You just put off put off put off, yeah you procrastinate.here is just to remember that we use the word by. so I could say I was procrastinating by watching TV.

# 10.loosens up [phr.松弛下来]
> 1)so you guys can remember this cause, you know what, maybe at the end of the day you want to loosen up your tight, so stop so tight.

> 2) You don't want to say this to like your boss, you only really want to say this to friends.or when the person you're talking about is not around. It should only be to someone you're close with, otherwise if you want to tell someone that you don't know too well to relax, you should just tell them relax. either way if you say loosen up to someone you're not close with they might get kind of upset.Yeah, I'd say so yeah, specially a coworker.

# 11. - aholic & workaholic & alcoholic & shopaholic
> so aholic just means that you love to do something.

# 12.a big fan of...
> 1) So basically we just use "big fan" to express really liking something."big fan" is a colloquial term that is used to express that someone really likes something or someone. It can also be used negatively to express dislike.if you're a fan of something, it means you like it. You know, you don't have to just be a fan of a person. I could say, "Johnny, I'm a real big fan of Chinese food."

> 2)Just note that saying "I'm not a big fan of sth./sb." is softer and more indirect than saying "I don't like sth./sb."

- 1. I'm a big fan of his music.

- 2. She's not a big fan of his.

- 3. My dad is a big fan of Japanese food.

> 1)If someone's a team player, well, they work well with a team of people,it just means they work well with other people or they really help other people out. Someone who's not a team player, they might seem kind of selfish. You know they really kind of just focus on theirself. But someone who's a team player doesn't just work hard to help themself but to help the people they're working with,they support the team.

> 2)if you get along well with someone like you said, you don't have disagreements, you're not gonna fight, you probably like the same stuff and probably think the same about a lot of things, right? So when you get along well with someone, it basically feels like you have a very friendly relationship with someone.
