# Dealing with difficult people at work 
# I.Type A and B personality theory
> The type A and B personality theory is quite well-known both in the medical community [医学界] and pop culture[流行文化]. It was formulated by two cardiologists /'kɑrdɪ'ɑlədʒɪst/ [n.心脏病专家], Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman, during the 1950s. The research was originally conducted to investigate how different types of personalities can increase the risk of coronary /'kɔrənɛri/  disease [n.冠心病]. In psychology /saɪ'kɑlədʒi/ [n.心理学], this p ersonality theory is mainly concerned with how people respond to stress.

# 1.Type A personality
> Type A individuals tend to be very competitive and self-critical[自我批判]. They are usually high-achievers and are in a race to achieve higher goals.[为了达成更高的目标而不懈奋进]

> Type A individuals experience a constant sense of urgency [总是处于紧迫感之中] - they seem to be in a constant struggle against the clock. They also tend to be easily aroused to anger [激怒] or hostility /hɑ'stɪləti/ [心怀敌意].

# 2.Type B personality
> Type B individuals are quite the opposite of Type A's. They tend to be more tolerant of others, are more relaxed, experience lower levels of anxiety [自身的焦虑水平更低] and display higher levels of imagination and creativity.

> Type B individuals sometimes are too relaxed and laid-back.[有时会过于放松，太过四平八稳] As such[就其本身而论], they may lack the drive [缺乏动力] to fully realize their career potentials.

> The Analytical person is normally neat and orderly [整洁有序] and approaches situations [应对不同情况] with a fully formed plan [完整的计划]. They are quiet and often enjoy working alone. These individuals are often perfectionists /pɚ'fɛkʃənɪst/ [完美主义者]. On the negative side, these are the individuals that can appear moody [情绪化], judgmental and seemingly unable to make decisions.[似乎无法做出决定]

# 2.The Driver [驾驭型]
> The Driver is energetic [精力充沛], positive and the visionary [有远见的] of all the personality types. They don't give up quickly or easily. Their manner can appear harsh [苛刻] to the sensitive personalities in the workplace. 

# 3.The Amiable [平易型]
> The Amiable /'emɪəbl/ person is often the most-liked person in the workplace. They always have a kind [友善的], encouraging word, are quiet and agreeable and try to avoid conflict at all costs.[并尽一切努力避免冲突]

# 4.The Expressive [表现型]
> The Expressive personality is the one that gathers enthusiasm [充满热情] for a project, convinces investors that a project will be successful and is genuinely interested in being part of a team. But they are not very organized.

# hyper- & hyper-organized [adj.非常井井有条的]
> 1)hyper means over or just very.we use hyper for a lot of different words like I could also say like hyper-energetic.Or like hyper-active.

> 2)in this situation right hyper-organized means a very organized person. when I look at this another like spoken way of saying this you could say she's super organized.

> 3)we use hyper for a lot of different words like I could also say like hyper-energetic.Or like hyper-active.And actually a lot of times especially for hyper-active kids, we might just call them hyper.Yeah that's true or you might be a little hyper after some coffee.

# 3.to a T [phr.追求极致] & perfectionist 
> 1)if she does everything to a T and she's really focused on those details.OK, so she is a detail-oriented worker. She pays a lot of attention to detail. Maybe these kinds of people would be like good at design and something.Yeah or you know what most jobs cause a lot of jobs require a lot of attention to detail especially if you are in the office.But either way to do something to a T just means to always pay attention to little details and not miss any small thing.

> 2)Either way balance is important. You don't want to have be too much of one thing. But yes so she's super ambitious and she's a perfectionist she wants everything to be perfect.being perfect can be good sometimes, but you know what, it's not always possible and this can drive a person really crazy. I say most of the time things can't be perfect.So you gotta just gotta learn to let go.

# 4.all that [phr.那么]
> that's the problem here that we're talking about because she is a perfectionist she wants everything to be great so she's not completely happy she's not all that satisfied.

> 2）touchy： it means to be sensitive like I can say something about you, and if you were touchy your feelings get hurt easily, you get sad easily. One downside here of being a Type A or potential downside is being touchy. they might be a little bit sensitive, easily annoyed.so this touchy this doesn't mean to like touch things.

> 3)If someone is pushy, it means they make you do something, like a salesperson is pushy.we have this word here, "push." It just means to make somebody do something or try to make somebody to do something. So basically, a pushy person is someone who's telling you what to do. so if someone is pushy, bossy, they're rude, and they're trying to make you do something.

> 4)your boss might be bossy, but that's okay. But if they're your coworker, they shouldn't really be telling you what to do because a bossy person they give you orders. They're always telling you what to do.I'd actually argue that a boss shouldn't be bossy. It's a boss—I mean, their job is to tell people what to do, to give orders, right? But when someone is bossy, it usually means they're pushing you too much. They try to control you too much, t's a little more than you should be doing.

I don't wanna make it too confusing here guys, but just remember this word means "it is really easy to like."and we only use it to describe people. You couldn't say, "Oh! This restaurant is likable.

> 2)So, personable is a lot like likable, And if you're personable, it means you have a good personality. You're like a really nice and friendly person.so basically, if you're personable, it's usually like it's easy for people to come and talk to you, they are friendly. So, basically, when people are personable, they're easy to get along with.we say they have good people skills, and these kinds of people are really good in business. You know they can make people like them, and then people will agree with them and they'll do what they say or whatever.

> 3)if someone's "attentive," it means they pay attention. They listen to you. They observe you. They don't ignore you.

> 4)They can also be really attentive with their work, right? Not just with people, but when they're doing their work, they probably pay a lot of attention to details and stuff like that.

# 8.laid back [phr.悠闲地、懒散的] & easy-going & slacker [n.懒鬼] & slacking off [phr.偷懒] & procrastinate by doing sth /pro'kræstɪnet/ [vi.拖延,耽搁] & flaky /'fleki/ [adj.不可靠的、薄而易剥落的]
> 1)so laid back ,easy-going this all means like relaxed.And they're not, they don't care about perfection.For sure, often it means that they are like, they don't have as much stress.

> 2) So this just means like if you're a slacker you don't work hard. Your're probably lazy.

> 3)you're probably slacking off. So to slack off just means to not work hard. it's not work hard to maybe even procrastinate. 

> 4)so you're putting off that work. you have to turn it in on Friday and then you wait until Thursday to start doing it when you could have started it on Monday. You just put off put off put off, yeah you procrastinate.here is just to remember that we use the word by. so I could say I was procrastinating by watching TV.

> 5)if someone's "flaky," it means they don't do what they say they're going to do.It basically means it's hard to depend on them.someone who's flaky.

> so to be fair so this is to like admit or agree with what someone else has said.Yeah so for example, so one might say, "It's a really good movie." You know, but maybe I don't agree it's a bad movie to me. But to be fair, the main actor is really good.

# 10.loosens up [phr.松弛下来]
> 1)so you guys can remember this cause, you know what, maybe at the end of the day you want to loosen up your tight, so stop so tight.

> 2) You don't want to say this to like your boss, you only really want to say this to friends.or when the person you're talking about is not around. It should only be to someone you're close with, otherwise if you want to tell someone that you don't know too well to relax, you should just tell them relax. either way if you say loosen up to someone you're not close with they might get kind of upset.Yeah, I'd say so yeah, specially a coworker.

# 11. - aholic & workaholic & alcoholic & shopaholic
> so aholic just means that you love to do something.

# 12.a big fan of...
> 1) So basically we just use "big fan" to express really liking something."big fan" is a colloquial term that is used to express that someone really likes something or someone. It can also be used negatively to express dislike.if you're a fan of something, it means you like it. You know, you don't have to just be a fan of a person. I could say, "Johnny, I'm a real big fan of Chinese food."

> 2)Just note that saying "I'm not a big fan of sth./sb." is softer and more indirect than saying "I don't like sth./sb."

- 1. I'm a big fan of his music.

- 2. She's not a big fan of his.

- 3. My dad is a big fan of Japanese food.

> 1)If someone's a team player, well, they work well with a team of people,it just means they work well with other people or they really help other people out. Someone who's not a team player, they might seem kind of selfish. You know they really kind of just focus on theirself. But someone who's a team player doesn't just work hard to help themself but to help the people they're working with,they support the team.

> 2)if you get along well with someone like you said, you don't have disagreements, you're not gonna fight, you probably like the same stuff and probably think the same about a lot of things, right? So when you get along well with someone, it basically feels like you have a very friendly relationship with someone.

# IV.pattern
***Oh, man. I’m doing a project with Alyssa, but I’m worried because she’s so type A.***

***Isn’t that a good thing? I mean, she’s a hyper-organized workaholic and does everything to a T.***

***Yeah, but because she’s overly ambitious and a perfectionist, she’s never all that satisfied.***

***Oh. I see what you mean. She’s also pretty competitive and doesn’t accept failure very well.***

***Exactly! She’s touchy and so obsessive, especially about time management!***

***Right! Since you’re type B and laid back, she’s probably going to think you’re a slacker.***

***Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I do procrastinate. But, at the end of the day, I do get things done.***

***True. Well, she may be hard to work with, but she is really is proactive and does get results.***

***I know. I know. I just hope she loosens up!***

# V.pattern
***Hey Michael, I heard you had a disagreement with Pam the other day. What happened?***

***Oh, let's just say Pam isn't a big fan of mine.***

***But you're so likable. How could that be?***

***Apparently, she thinks I'm pushy and bossy.***

***Oh well, she's flaky. Say, I've always wondered, do you have a favorite coworker?***

***Other than you, Emily? I'd have to say Jim. He's always so enthusiastic. How about you?***

***Yeah, that Jim is a real team player. As for me, I get along well with Kelly***

***Kelly is really warm and personable, which is why we have her in customer service.***

***Agreed. I'd even say she's the most attentive employee at the company.***

***Sounds like we may have a new employee of the month.***

# V.Pattern
***William, thanks for taking the time to meet with me today. I wouldn't have bothered you if I had other options.***

***No problem. I understand that this is a delicate issue. So you have some concerns about the way Amanda works.***

***First of all, let me say that I have the utmost respect for her professionally. She's done some really amazing things since she got here and the numbers speak for themselves. But I also have some serious reservations about how she has been managing the team, namely her communication style and how she interacts with people.***

***I know she's a straight-shooter and that could rub people the wrong way.***

***And that's fine. We don't expect to be coddled. But I think there's a line between pushing your team to get the most out of them and outright disrespect for people.***

***Of course. So how has Amanda treated you or people on your team with disrespect?***

***I don't want to be a tattle-tale. I'm simply recounting events that happened. On more than one occasion,she has openly insulted members of the team, myself included. She has used abusive language such as 'dumb', 'mediocre'.***

***Greg, I'm not siding with Amanda. I just want to get the details. So I'm gonna have to ask you, did she use those words to critique the work or people?***

***Well, both. And even if she's talking about work, this kind of attitude and language is extremely damaging and demoralizing.***

***Of course. And I'm really glad you've brought it to my attention. You've been with us for a long time, Greg.You know the kind of organization that we want to build here.***

***Yes. That's' why I wanted to talk to you about this, because I know why people love working here and when they do their best kind of work. I don't want to see that lost.***

***Again, I really appreciate your frankness and loyalty. I'll have a thorough conversation with Amanda and work with her to better integrate with the team.***

***Thanks for your time, William. One more thing, you know this could potentially be risky for me.***

***Of course I do. You have my word this will be kept confidential.***

# V.pattern
***William, you wanted to see me?***

***That's right. Would you like some coffee or tea?***

***No, I'm fine. So what is it?***

***Well, you're crushing it here. We've had the best quarter in the company's history. And you've played an instrumental role in that.***

***I'm very glad to hear that. But we still need to do a lot more if we want to sustain the growth.***

***So how are you finding working with your team? Do you think you have the people and support to achieve what we set out to do?***

***In general, yes. I know I can be demanding on my team. But if we are striving to do big and groundbreaking things, we all need to push ourselves far beyond what we're comfortable with.***

***Yes, and that's why we brought you here. We believe you are exactly the kind of leader we need in order to realize our ambitions. But I'm also aware that some of our people might find it hard to adjust to a new style and pace.***

***William, when you’re shooting for the moon, the nature of the work is bound to be challenging.***

***Yes, I agree. But I'd also like for us to coach our team members and help them elevate themselves in order to continue our success.***

***I get that. But I also do believe that we need to set higher expectations for our employees. It's easy to be cuddly and pleasant, but you risk creating an environment where people are content with just good enough.***

***Amanda, I admire your grit. We're all working towards the same goal here. I'd like to see how we could work together to get our team members to think the same way rather than feeling negative about it.***

***I believe it requires a cultural shift. People need to understand that we are trying to do exceptional things, for the company as well as for their professional development.***

***Yeah, I agree. But I'd still like to strike a balance between extracting the most out of our employees and creating a cohesive workplace.***

***Ok, William, I get it. I'll make adjustments where necessary. But I hope you can also take the lead in creating a company culture where everyone strives for the best.***

***Of course. Please trust me on that. I appreciate your candidness as always.***
