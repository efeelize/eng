# Type A personality
# I.Type A and B personality theory
> The type A and B personality theory is quite well-known both in the medical community [医学界] and pop culture[流行文化]. It was formulated by two cardiologists /'kɑrdɪ'ɑlədʒɪst/ [n.心脏病专家], Meyer Friedman and R. H. Rosenman, during the 1950s. The research was originally conducted to investigate how different types of personalities can increase the risk of coronary /'kɔrənɛri/  disease [n.冠心病]. In psychology /saɪ'kɑlədʒi/ [n.心理学], this personality theory is mainly concerned with how people respond to stress.

# 1.Type A personality
> Type A individuals tend to be very competitive and self-critical[自我批判]. They are usually high-achievers and are in a race to achieve higher goals.[为了达成更高的目标而不懈奋进]

> Type A individuals experience a constant sense of urgency [总是处于紧迫感之中] - they seem to be in a constant struggle against the clock. They also tend to be easily aroused to anger [激怒] or hostility /hɑ'stɪləti/ [心怀敌意].

# 2.Type B personality
> Type B individuals are quite the opposite of Type A's. They tend to be more tolerant of others, are more relaxed, experience lower levels of anxiety [自身的焦虑水平更低] and display higher levels of imagination and creativity.

> Type B individuals sometimes are too relaxed and laid-back.[有时会过于放松，太过四平八稳] As such[就其本身而论], they may lack the drive [缺乏动力] to fully realize their career potentials.

***Oh, man. I’m doing a project with Alyssa, but I’m worried because she’s so type A.***

***Isn’t that a good thing? I mean, she’s a hyper-organized workaholic and does everything to a T.***

***Yeah, but because she’s overly ambitious and a perfectionist, she’s never all that satisfied.***

***Oh. I see what you mean. She’s also pretty competitive and doesn’t accept failure very well.***

***Exactly! She’s touchy and so obsessive, especially about time management!***

***Right! Since you’re type B and laid back, she’s probably going to think you’re a slacker.***

***Yeah. I mean, to be fair, I do procrastinate. But, at the end of the day, I do get things done.***

***True. Well, she may be hard to work with, but she is really is proactive and does get results.***

***I know. I know. I just hope she loosens up!***
