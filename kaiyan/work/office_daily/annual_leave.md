# I.Here's how many paid vacation days the typical American worker gets
> As summer heats up, workers across the country are enjoying some well-earned time off. People who take vacations report higher productivity.But compared to employees in other nations, Americans take significantly fewer days off.

> One reason for this is that American companies offer fewer vacation days. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 76 percent of private industry workers (who make up 84.7 percent of all workers) receive paid vacation days. After one year of employment, these workers were granted 10 days of paid vacation, on average.

> This number grows modestly as years of tenure with an employer increase. In 2017, the average worker with five years of experience at a company was given 15 days of paid vacation and the average worker with 20 years of experience was given 20 days.

> What's more, according to a study from the U.S. Travel Association’s Project Time Off, 52 percent of Americans didn't even use all of their vacation days in 2017.

> Americans used to understand the importance of getting away from the office. From 1976 to 2000, the average working American took off more than 20 days a year. Starting in 2000, workers have been taking fewer days off. In 2015, American workers took an average of just 16 days off.

> The United States is the only advanced economy in the world that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation days and paid holidays,” says John Schmitt, Vice President of the Economic Policy Institute. As a result, businesses must voluntarily provide paid leave.

***Hi Tina, is this a good time?***

***I was wondering if I could take some time off at the end of next month?***

***How much time are we talking about here?***

***Two weeks. I'd be using my annual leave.***

***Hmm. That's right in the middle of peak season, Mark.***

***I'm aware of that. I've asked Paul to cover some of my responsibilities while I'm gone.***

***Will he be able to handle the extra workload?***

***I have complete faith in him. Besides, he's been looking for opportunities to step up here at the office.***

***Well I'd really like to accommodate you, Mark. Maybe there is some way we could meet in the middle?***

***I suppose I could take two long weekends, and then take off the week in the middle. That should give me enough time.***

***Okay, that sounds a bit more doable. And I appreciate you giving plenty of notice. Would you mind sending me an email with your dates just so I have a copy?***

***I'll get right on it!***
