# 1.a little & a few
> 1)A little is used with uncountable nouns[不可数名词], such as water. But in this dialogue we see it used differently. A little is used with the adjective “more formal.” [A little和形容词“more formal”连用] Here is another example of a little being used with an adjective:

- Can you make it a little spicier?

- She had a little more fun once her friends arrived.

> A few is used with countable nouns[可数名词]. Countable nouns mean that when the noun is plural numbers can be used in front of it[复数情况下前面能加上数字表示数量的名词]. If that’s the case, then a few can also be used with it. For example:

- I have 12 documents = I have a few documents.

- They want a few copies of this page.

- Sally has a little more patience than Dan.

***Hey Jennifer, I took a look at the document. There are a few things that need to be revised.***

***Since this document is for a meeting, the title font should be a little more formal.***

***Good. Also, this data would be easier to comprehend if it was displayed as a table.***

***Ok. I’ll convert that information into a table.***

***Also, the formatting here is different from the rest. We need to adjust that.***

***This information is copied from another document. The document had a completely different format. I wasn’t able to change it.***

***You can use the format painter. It’s the icon that looks like a paintbrush. First, select the text whose format you want to copy, click on the format painter, and then select the text that you want to change. And there you go!***
