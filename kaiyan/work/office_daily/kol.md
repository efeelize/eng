# 1.hands on/off
> 1)When we describe something as being hands-on, it means that it involves or offers active participation. As we heard in this lesson, it can describe experiences. Hands-on parenting would describe parents who are actively
involved in their child's life by staying up to date and establishing rules. Similarly, a hands-on manager would be involved in the day-to-day business, and provide employee training.

> 2)Hands-off, on the other hand, means that there is no involvement. Hands-off parenting involves fewer rules and more freedom for the child, while hands-off managers let their teams accomplish things on their own.

> 3)Another meaning of "hands off" means "don't touch," usually referring to someone's prized possession.

***Thanks for taking the time to meet me, Jason.***

***No problem. Jim mentioned you’re looking for some digital marketing advice.***

***Yes, I am. Jim speaks very highly of your work.***

***That’s very kind of him. Can you give me a few bullet points regarding your marketing needs in terms of goals, channels and trends?***

***Well, my ultimate goal is to increase new user acquisition to our existing social media channels.***

***Can I ask what your daily average number is?***

***We're currently getting about 1000 new followers every day. We don't advertise. It's all through word of mouth.***

***That’s pretty good considering it’s all organic. But I think you should start testing paid options to broaden your reach.***

***That’s exactly what I’d like to do. What would you say is the best way to get started?***

***If you want to test it out, I'd suggest trying with mobile ad networks. Plan for at least two months to test,analyze and optimize.***

***Ok. Got it.***

***KOL is a second option, but much more challenging to optimize if you choose larger size KOLs. If you use smaller ones, you'll need to build in around a week to capture initial impact.***

***Thanks for your insight! We just started a few campaigns on a mobile ad network. We’ll see how those go.***

***Sounds like you’re on the right track. As long as you keep AB testing through different types of copy,offers, and images, it should be more than enough to get some hands-on learning.***

***Will do. Really appreciate your help!***
