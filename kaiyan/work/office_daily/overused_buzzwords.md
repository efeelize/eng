# Overused buzzwords
# I.Buzzwords and their definition
> Buzzwords are terms and phrases that sound impressive, cool, or even exciting, but not everyone always understands the definition of them.

> Buzzwords can either be cringe /krɪndʒ/ -worthy[让人难堪], overused, or irrelevant, or they can be valuable and have merit. Ultimately, there are a lot of buzzwords in the business world – especially in marketing, sales, and service.

# 1.Big data [大数据]
> The massive collection of structured [大量结构化] and unstructured data [非结构化数据] that is often difficult to process through traditional means[很难通过传统方法处理]. Data collected from mobile, web browsing, voice data, etc.

# 2.Leverage
> It refers to the situation when one person has an advantage over another. Additionally, this term can be used when referring to taking advantage of a great opportunity or using a feature/product to its full extent.

# 3.Quota [配额]
> A target that sales reps try to reach over a certain period of time, often on a monthly or quarterly basis. A quota can be measured in both dollar amount or in number of deals closed.

# 4.Customer lifecycle [客户生命周期]
> A customer lifecycle outlines the stages a prospect goes through before, during, and after completing a transaction with a company [潜在客户在与公司完成交易之前、期间和之后经历的各个阶段]. Number of stages can vary depending on your business and industry.[根据你的业务和行业，阶段的数量可能会有所不同]

# II.Buzzwords you need to forget 
# 1.Digital transformation
> This seemingly cutting-edge [前沿] phrase dwells /dwɛl/ [vi.居住,住] in obscurity /əb'skjʊrəti/ [n.晦涩或不明的事物]. It's a throwaway /'θroəwe/ [宣传小册子] line. Instead of using it as a blanket statement of your technological intentions, be specific. Talk about how your teams will use artificial intelligence [人工智能] or cloud-based platforms [云的平台]. Without context, "digital transformation [数字变革]" says little.

# 2.Crushing it [干得漂亮]
> You'd be surprised how often people say this. Even if they use it ironically [讽刺意味], "crushing it" always sounds a little too macho /'mɑtʃo/ [adj.大男子气概的]. If you or someone else has done an amazing job, be forthcoming and explain why.

# 3.Girl boss
> It is believed that woman's leadership should not be diminished /də'mɪnɪʃ/ [adj.减少了的,被贬低的] by qualifying her position with a gender-focused term [聚焦性别]. If you feel like it's a good way to recognize a leader like Arianna Huffington [《赫芬顿邮报》], then maybe you should also start referring to Jeff Bezos as a "boy boss."

# III.grammar
# 1.something needs doing...
> When we want to express what an object needs, we often use the phrase "something needs doing." Some examples from our daily lives might include "the laundry needs doing," "the dishes need washing," or the "bed needs making."

> We can see a slightly more advanced use of this phrase in our dialogue: The envelope needs pushing. This is just a play on the phrase "push the envelope" and in fitting with the theme of our lesson sounds a bit like a buzzword!

- 1. Honey, what time are you coming home? The dog needs walking. [狗需要遛一遛]

- 2. Could you help us while we're on vacation? Our plants need watering. [植物需要浇水]

- 3. If you can't see where you are walking, your hair probably needs cutting.[头发可能需要修剪]

# 2.cram in  [v.塞入、挤入]
> so "cram in" basically means to force, to put something in with force, something that's maybe a bit too big. I think of when I go traveling, I pack my suitcase and I keep wanting to put more stuff in. I try to cram too much stuff into my suitcase.And in this speech, it seems like the CEO crammed too many of these buzzwords in.

# 3.think outside the box [phr.跳出思维定式]
> "Think outside the box." This is a really old one, isn't it?I mean somewhere in the nineties, maybe it was a tech company or I think Apple, right? Apple always said think different.But thinking outside the box really just means think in a different way."the box" kind of means tradition. So really, this just means be creative.

# 4.life cycle [n.生命周期]
> so "a life cycle" is a good phrase. You can almost see the word circle in there.and circles and cycles can be fairly similar. A cycle does not need to be a perfect circle, but it does kind of go around and around like a circle.Right, but you can also think about the life cycle of a product. 

# 5.cliché & buzzword
> 1)this really just means overused phrase.in the beginning, it sounds really cool and original, but later it just sounds kind of not interesting.

> 2)basically, the difference between a buzzword and a cliché. Cliché has been around for a long time.sometimes maybe it's because they're true, as well.It's just that we're kind of bored of hearing them.

# 6.take actionable steps [phr.采取行动] & push the envelope [phr.挑战极限]
> 1)"Take actionable steps." This just means take practical steps.And we keep going back and forth with this idea of buzzwords being new and clichés being old. I don't remember the word "actionable" when I was a kid. no, neither did I. I don't think anyone ever said it.

> 2)"Push the envelope." Okay, basically, instead of thinking outside of the box, it's almost like making the box bigger.you're trying to push the limits of the box.at work, we always use this phrase when we're talking about science and technology.

# 7.collaborate & get along 
> 1)in fact, we use it a lot in our lessons, so you know, we don't really want to tell you guys don't use it. It's just that if you are in an office, my goodness, are you going to hear this a lot! it's really just "work together, help each other, you know, work closely."We have been asked a few times what's the difference between collaborate and cooperate. Truth is, with cooperation or cooperating, you don't really need to work all that closely.

> 2)Get along or just have some kind of agreement, whereas like Connor says, this one really means work closely with.

# 8.do sth with nuance /ˈnuˌɑns/ [n.细微差别]
> 1)so it's kind of an uncountable noun.so this is another French word. "Nuance," it really just means looking at the details carefully.So, we can say do something with nuance, but we also use this a lot as an adjective "nuanced." We're having a nuanced conversation where we are talking about the details.

> 2) the opposite of a nuanced conversation or a nuanced idea is a black and white conversation. You are either team A or team B. Well, you know, life has a lot of room for nuance.In fact, it's usually a lot of gray area.Exactly, that's what comes to mind, too. So, if anyone ever tries to tell you that life is black and white, you can either say, "No, no, there's lots of gray area." Or you can say, "There is a lot of nuance."

# 9.synergy /'sɪnɚdʒi/ [n.协同作用;协同;增效] & synergistic [adj.] & synergize [v.]
> 1)So "synergy" is this thing that just appears or occurs when teams work well together. if we look at the beginning of the word, is S-Y-N. We get this idea of kind of being together, like sync. And this word is used in companies all times because companies are made of teams and teams work together. They can create more power if they work together.

> 2)So we tend to use this word in phrases like "they have synergy." "There's no synergy."

> 3) I've even heard the adjective "synergistic."

> 4)Synergize. Yeah, "let's synergize this meeting."

***I feel I've experienced the whole life cycle of that phrase, from buzzword to cliché.***

***Well, we all need to take actionable steps to push the envelope!***

***And if I hear the word "collaborate" or "disrupt" one more time, I'm gonna be sick!***

***Remember, we need to do all of this with nuance.***

***She sounds like a friend of mine who calls himself an influencer.***

***I'm sure he influences someone. So then she took me to a new restaurant that has all kinds of superfoods. I thought to myself, "You mean salads?"***

***Wow, I bet she's pretty woke, too.***

***Yep. When I ordered chicken wings, she said she was almost triggered because she's vegan.***
