***Henry, I’ve been thinking a lot about our new plan. To be honest, I think we need to revisit some of our ideas before implementing it.***

***What do you mean? I thought we had agreed on expanding the product portfolio.***

***Well, I just want to make sure that we evaluate things properly before committing to such a big decision.***

***Ok. What exactly are your concerns?***

***I'm not entirely sure that we've correctly identified the customer pain points. To quote Henry Ford, "If I had asked what people wanted, they would have said faster horses."***

***You're saying our decision is taking customers' needs at face value? But we've done surveys throughout the year. They kept saying yes to more products.***

***That's true. But didn't we frame the question in a way that might have led them to give the answer we wanted to hear?***

***Um. I see your point. I mean we've always thought the logical next step to grow the business is to add more products, which might have clouded our judgment.***

***I've been digging into the survey results and other customer behavior data. What seems to frustrate our customers the most isn't having more products to choose from, but rather lacking a trusted source like ours to buy products they wouldn't find elsewhere.***

***I hear what you're saying. I'll need some time to analyze the data myself. Let's meet on Thursday to pick up the discussion.***
