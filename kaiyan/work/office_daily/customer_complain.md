# Customer_complain
# I.customer's pain
> In this lesson we’ve talked about identifying customers’ pain points. But how exactly do you identify them? First and most obvious, you need to properly target the right customers. Once you’ve done that, you need to put yourself in their shoes. What are their needs? What frustrates them? 

> Hardly anyone buys a product or a service unless they want to satisfy a particular need or solve a particular problem. So, to quote former American President Bill Clinton, show them that you “feel their pain”. Just as importantly, when searching for their needs, you need to ask the right questions. 

> Don’t try to frame the questions in such a way that you get a desired response. Rather, genuinely ask the customers what their concerns are. Remember that the questions need to be part of a conversation. If you can demonstrate that you are committed to solving your customers’ problems, then you will find your customer base expanding.

# III.pattern
***Henry, I’ve been thinking a lot about our new plan. To be honest, I think we need to revisit some of our ideas before implementing it.***

***What do you mean? I thought we had agreed on expanding the product portfolio.***

***Well, I just want to make sure that we evaluate things properly before committing to such a big decision.***

***Ok. What exactly are your concerns?***

***I'm not entirely sure that we've correctly identified the customer pain points. To quote Henry Ford, "If I had asked what people wanted, they would have said faster horses."***

***You're saying our decision is taking customers' needs at face value? But we've done surveys throughout the year. They kept saying yes to more products.***

***That's true. But didn't we frame the question in a way that might have led them to give the answer we wanted to hear?***

***Um. I see your point. I mean we've always thought the logical next step to grow the business is to add more products, which might have clouded our judgment.***

***I've been digging into the survey results and other customer behavior data. What seems to frustrate our customers the most isn't having more products to choose from, but rather lacking a trusted source like ours to buy products they wouldn't find elsewhere.***

***I hear what you're saying. I'll need some time to analyze the data myself. Let's meet on Thursday to pick up the discussion.***
