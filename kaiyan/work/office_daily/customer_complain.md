# Customer_pain_points/loyalty
# I.customer's pain
> In this lesson we’ve talked about identifying customers’ pain points. But how exactly do you identify them? First and most obvious, you need to properly target the right customers. Once you’ve done that, you need to put yourself in their shoes. What are their needs? What frustrates them? 

> Hardly anyone buys a product or a service unless they want to satisfy a particular need or solve a particular problem. So, to quote former American President Bill Clinton, show them that you “feel their pain”. Just as importantly, when searching for their needs, you need to ask the right questions. 

> Don’t try to frame the questions in such a way that you get a desired response. Rather, genuinely ask the customers what their concerns are. Remember that the questions need to be part of a conversation. If you can demonstrate that you are committed to solving your customers’ problems, then you will find your customer base expanding.

# II.5 types of customer loyalty programs
## 1)points prpgrams [积分制度]
> Points programs are among the most popular types of customer loyalty programs. Simply put, every time your customer makes a purchase, they earn points. The points can be redeemed for credit toward their next purchase, discounted services, or giveaways.

## 2)tier-based programs [等级制度]
> Tier programs start with a points program that allows customers to earn rewards with every purchase. However, tier programs are like video games; once you complete one level of spending, loyal customers can unlock a new level that gives them access to bigger benefits and more perks.

## 3)value-based programs [基于创造价值的制度]
> A value-based rewards program offers your company an opportunity to build customer engagement through your shared commitment to a project or cause. The benefit of the value-based customer loyalty program is that it allows customers to feel like their purchase, whether big or small, is connected to a larger mission that improves the lives of others.

## 4)spend-based programs [基于花费的制度]
> How do you reward those customers who are spending more money in a shorter period of time? Spend-based customer rewards programs allow companies to reward their highest paying clientele. Airlines, in particular, are transitioning from the points method to spend-based programs. Those travelers who reach elite status sooner are rewarded with perks like complimentary lounge access and early boarding.

## 5)gaming programs
> Gaming programs introduce an element of fun into the mundane task of making a purchase. Gaming-based customer loyalty programs allow customers to get excited about spending money at the places they love the most.

# III.grammar
# 1.quotes
> Quoting someone is a great way to sound knowledgeable. Remember that quote is both a noun and a verb.so someone’s words can be called a quote, and when you say those words, you are quoting them. If you quote somebody incorrectly, that is called a misquote.

# 2. shoudn't we be giving 
> The truth is that native speakers love to use progressive tenses. In many cases they sound less direct than simple ones [进行时态在许多情况下，听起来比一般现在时要委婉], which is why we often say things like "I was wondering" and "I was thinking" instead of "I wonder" and "I thought." And even though Randy is asking a legitimate question here, he could also use this same pattern to offer suggestions to other people.

> If you don't use a progressive tense here, don't worry. You're not committing some terrible infraction.Remember, there are often many ways to express the same thing in English.

# III.pattern
***Henry, I’ve been thinking a lot about our new plan. To be honest, I think we need to revisit some of our ideas before implementing it.***

***What do you mean? I thought we had agreed on expanding the product portfolio.***

***Well, I just want to make sure that we evaluate things properly before committing to such a big decision.***

***Ok. What exactly are your concerns?***

***I'm not entirely sure that we've correctly identified the customer pain points. To quote Henry Ford, "If I had asked what people wanted, they would have said faster horses."***

***You're saying our decision is taking customers' needs at face value? But we've done surveys throughout the year. They kept saying yes to more products.***

***That's true. But didn't we frame the question in a way that might have led them to give the answer we wanted to hear?***

***Um. I see your point. I mean we've always thought the logical next step to grow the business is to add more products, which might have clouded our judgment.***

***I've been digging into the survey results and other customer behavior data. What seems to frustrate our customers the most isn't having more products to choose from, but rather lacking a trusted source like ours to buy products they wouldn't find elsewhere.***

***I hear what you're saying. I'll need some time to analyze the data myself. Let's meet on Thursday to pick up the discussion.***

# IV.pattern
***Randy, we've looked at your customer loyalty program, and we think that you'd benefit from using Net Promoter Score data.***

***Right, we've discussed using NPS before, but we're unsure how to best implement it in our program.***

***Not all customers are created equal, nor is their level of loyalty. If you want to optimize your program, you need to segment your customers better.***

***That's where the "detractors," "passive" and "promoters" distinction of NPS comes in, right?***

***Exactly. Each type of customer values different things. For example, detractors and passives both tend to see value in price discounts.***

***But shouldn't we be giving the highest discounts to the promoters?***

***Price doesn't really incentivize promoters. For them, you can best add value by offering them nonmonetary perks.***

***Kind of like what Amazon does with its Prime program right?***

***Exactly. It gives customers tons of value-added services like free upgrades, exclusive content, and extra-fast shipping.***

***Well if it's good enough for Amazon, it's good enough for us. Let's get started!***
