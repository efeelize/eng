***Henry, I appreciate your point of view, but unless we make some significant cutbacks the whole company could go under.***

***Well, I'd hate to see layoffs; I think there are other ways to reduce costs like cutting all overtime pay. Then hopefully…***

***I’m sorry Jessica, but I think that’s completely out of the question. Without overtime pay we cannot continue production. If we don’t keep the production going then...***

***Please Henry, let's not exaggerate here. I don’t think it's so black and white. The point I'm making is…***

***Okay guys, we've got to stop arguing. Let's all calm down, work together, and we can find a way out of this mess, okay?***
