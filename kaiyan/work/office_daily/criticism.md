# Criticism
# I.Tips for how to handle criticism
> Being sensitive to criticism can be a sticky situation. Sometimes people may even stop working toward a goal out of fear of being critiqued. Here are some helpful tips to handle any kind of criticism that heads our way.

# 1.Listen up
> Figure out whether the criticism is constructive [有益] or simply rude [单纯的无理宣泄]. You may feel hurt when your partner says you're controlling [强势], but having him point out this flaw [指出你的缺点] may help you change and ultimately save the relationship. If criticism could be helpful, lend all ears [洗耳恭听] and try to learn from it instead of getting defensive [心怀戒备].

# 2.Don't take it personally [不要把批评当成私人恩怨]
> Try to remove yourself from the situation and focus on what's being critiqued /krɪ'tik/ [vt.批判]. That C+ midterm [期中考试] doesn't reflect your A+ personality [A+人格]! Instead, it's a reminder to study a little harder next time, skip all that partying the night before, or realize that calculus /'kælkjələs/ [微积分] simply isn't your biggest strength.

# 3.Manage stress [控制压力]
> When we're constantly on edge, we can feel out of control [失控] and unable to respond to criticism with a clear head. So take a deep breath to keep those stress levels in check.

# II.How to evaluate an employee's performance
> Employee performance evaluation is a key factor to inspire your employees, improve the quality of work, and keep them motivated. There are some important points to consider when you evaluate a team member.

# 1.Quality of work
> In the world of web, our most important data point is the quality of work that our employees create.This is measured through regular review of our client deliverables, their role in client efforts, stability of the production changes/platform, best practices, and feedback from the client.

# 2. Level of creativity
> Creativity is one of the most important points in evaluating employee performance.How often did the employee question basic assumptions about a problem and come up with a new solution? Did they think outside of the box and successfully take risks on their own?

# 3.Amount of consistent improvement
> No employee has the capacity to be truly excellent at every evaluation point on our quarterly review form; however, every employee has the opportunity to improve each day, month, quarter, and year.The desire and effort to become better is the most rewardable quality.

# III.grammar
# 1.I couldn’t help (but) + v./ + reflexive /rɪ'flɛksɪv/ pronoun [反身代词].
> 1)The base of the phrase “I couldn’t help but + verb” means that you cannot control this action and did this unintentionally.  it means that "I had no control over this."

> 2)So, by saying “I couldn’t help but notice,” you are showing that you were not actively looking for this person’s mistakes.The phrase “I couldn’t help but notice” can be used to politely bring up a problem. For example, “I couldn’t help but notice that your reports have been a bit late.”

> 3)Note: It’s possible to omit “but” and say “I couldn’t help + verb-ing” (e.g, I couldn’t help noticing). However, adding “but” makes it more polite and formal.

> 4)We can also say, “I couldn’t help + reflexive /rɪ'flɛksɪv/ pronoun.” This means that the person has no control over themselves. (I couldn’t help myself! I ate the entire box of cookies.)

- 1. I couldn't help but notice that you've been looking really tired.

- 2. I couldn't help but notice that she's been really upset.

- 3. They were so loud when they were talking. I couldn't help but overhear their conversation.

# 2.performance [n.表现、业绩]
> 1)so your performance is how well you do something.A job or an activity or a task. If you did it well, then your performance was good.you performed well. But you could perform poorly. If you perform poorly, then you might get a bad performance review.So that's when—at like the end of the year, —they look over how well you did at work.But it can be used for other things too, like a machine or a phone. Maybe your smartphone is not performing well.

> 2)Or when we talk about cars, we can say that maybe, "I bought a high-performance car."Like a race car.

# 3.regarding [prep.关于] & in regards to 
> 1)So "regarding" just means "about," kind of "related to this." For example, "I wrote an email regarding my new car."Or when you start a job, you might have questions regarding your pay.about your pay. It can also be used to introduce something. For example, maybe in an email I write, "Hey, regarding the budget, we need to spend less money."

> 2)Now you could also say "in regards to," but that is more formal.

# 4.timeline [n.时间线、时间表] & schedule 
> 1)the timeline is just the schedule or plan.We often use it when we're asking, for example, how much time something will take, like "What's your timeline?"or you might ask someone to make more detailed timeline.And verbs we use with this, you can provide a timeline. But timeline can be too short, so you need to make it more detailed. 

> 2)But here it just means schedule. Sometimes it takes people a while to get used to the new timeline.

# 5.to clarify [v.澄清、确认、说明] & clarification [n.]
> "To clarify" means to "make this clear."To make it clear, to explain something that might be confusing.To make it clear, to explain something that might be confusing. So for example, if you're in a meeting you could say, "Could you clarify that? I didn't quite understand."Or if you said something confusing which I often do, I might say, "Oh, wait wait wait, let me clarify that."

> 2)and so one might say, "Thanks for the clarification."This is a pretty polite word. It's kind of similar to that phrasal verb "clear up."

# 6.accordingly [adv.相应的]
>  this just means the correct way or appropriately. or following this schedule. when you get a new job, there might be a dress code. Maybe you have to dress according to that dress code. You have to dress accordingly. so you have to follow the rules.Follow the rules, exactly, Or I think of, if someone goes to dinner at a guesthouse, they have to act accordingly. They have to behave well.you have to be polite. And in situations like this, you also have to act accordingly.

# 7.workload [n.工作量]
> This is a great noun. It just means you know how much work you're getting, how much work you have to do. so you could have a heavy workload—you can have a lot of work to do—or a light workload.

# 8.thorough /'θɝo/ [adj.详细的、细致的]
> If you are thorough,  it means you're careful, you look at all the details and you don't make any errors.So you can check something "thoroughly," that is the adverb version.

# 9.feedback [n.反馈]
> 1)So "feedback." This is just opinions. like you did a good job. You did a bad job. This is all feedback. if I do some work, I usually ask somebody else for feedback. Just "What you think about this, is it good? Is it bad? Tell me how to make it better."so you could also get customer feedback, Like companies, in order to make their product better, they need to get feedback. They need to get the opinions of the customers.that's really important. And hopefully they get a lot of positive feedback.

> 2)So if she said, "I appreciate the criticism." It might feel like she's taking it a little personally, like she's sad.A little rude as well. It's like "Hey, it's not criticism, it's feedback, it's positive."So it's better to just say "I appreciate the feedback." Don't say "I appreciate the criticism."
