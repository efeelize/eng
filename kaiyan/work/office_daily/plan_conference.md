***I’d like to start discussing the plan for the upcoming Pacific Northwest Health Care Conference.***

***As you know, this will be the first time we’ll have a booth on the exhibition hall floor, so we’re really trying to make a splash with the attendees.***

***What’s size booth we were able to get?***

***It’s one of the smaller sizes, unfortunately, so that won’t be working in our favor. But we’re going to make up for it.***

***What are you planning?***

***Our booth is going to be delineated into two spaces - an interactive area and a customer feedback area. In the interactive area, we're going to have mobile devices set up to allow attendees to try out our new app.This will be the focal point of the booth, with bright banners advertising that you can get a code for a week of complimentary use of the app if they sign up for our mailing list.***

***Alright. Feel free to use iPads from the tech department for that. You can contact the design department to get the ball rolling on creating banners. What about in the customer feedback area?***

***Well, we're going to have a few people onhand in the interactive area to answer questions and get feedback, but on the other side of the booth we'll have a dedicated area for networking with potential clients and answering questions more in-depth.***

***Good. Don’t forget that networking and getting sales leads was a main impetus for us signing up for a conference, so don’t neglect this section of the booth.***

***Of course. We’re planning on bringing some of our most knowledgeable staff with us to man that side of the booth.***

***Sounds good. Also, we still have a few thousand three-fold brochures from the Southern California Medical Professionals Conference in March. Can you use them?***

***I already checked them and decided that some key information was out-of-date, so I’ve had them updated and re-ordered.***

***hanks for being so on top of the ball. Let’s check in again this time next week.***
