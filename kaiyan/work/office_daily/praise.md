# I.How to give positive feedback
> Performance feedback [绩效反馈] is one of a manager's power tools used to support behavioral change [改变员工行为方式] or reinforce positive behavior [强化员工正向行为] in the workplace. While constructive and negative feedback gets most of the attention in training programs and leadership materials [训练材料], positive feedback at work is every bit as important.

> Feedback, whether positive or negative, must be specific to have an effect on future performance. "Great job" isn't enough. You need to add some details. For instance, to give feedback on a presentation, you can put it in this way: "Great job on that presentation today. Your competitive analysis [竞品分析] was spot on [非常准确], and your recommendations were backed with facts. I'm sure the executive team [管理团队] loved your enthusiasm for the initiative, too."

> Giving positive feedback can be a little trickier [难] than it sounds. Keep the following tips in mind:

- Always deliver feedback as close in time to the event as possible [要尽可能及时提出反馈]. 

- Link the positive behavior to real business results [实际的业绩成果] if you can. 

- Unlike negative feedback, positive feedback can be delivered in front of others [在他人面前提出正面反馈], if you think they'll benefit as well.

# II.grammar
# 1.I couldn’t have done without sb/sth [phr.没有....就做不到...] & I could have done it without sb/sth [phr.没有...就做成了...]
> 1)The phrase “I couldn’t have done without someone/something” is a polite way to say that this person or thing was necessary to your success.

> 2)When saying this phrase, remember to always use the negative “couldn’t have + pp.” If the positive “could have + pp” is used, then it sounds like you could have done this action on your own, and the other person’s help was unnecessary.

> 3)We often use this phrase to give someone praise or recognition, to tell them that they've done a good job. And remember here guys that it's "I couldn't have done it without," and then the person or thing. 

> 4)If you say "I could have done it without something," it's the total opposite meaning. If you say "I could have done it without her," then it means that she was not important, she did not help. 

- 1. I couldn't have done it without the support of my family and friends. [没有父母朋友的帮助，我做不到今天这一步]

- 2. I couldn't have done it without the encouragement of my boss. [没有上司的鼓励，我做不到今天这一步]

- 3. I couldn't have done it without the knowledge and experience that I've gained at this company.[没有我在公司获得的知识和经验，我做不到今天这一步]

# 2.informative /ɪnˈfɔːrmətɪv/ [adj.信息丰富的]
> 1)informative, this basically means to have a lot of information, to teach you a lot.so it comes from the verb "to inform," which means to give information.

> 2)you could have an informative discussion, so you would learn a lot from this discussion, or you could have an informative meeting, or a person could be informative as well.I also think of things like documentaries. They're always on some sort of topic and it could be very informative, but this presentation was also inspirational.

# 3.inspirational /ˌɪnspəˈreɪʃənəl/ [adj.鼓舞人心的]
> 1)so it inspires people, and when something inspires people, it especially makes them think creatively. It makes them think, but it also makes them want to do, to like perform. 

> 2)Often you might see an inspirational story on the TV. So someone starts their own company and they become very successful. This inspires you to work hard as well. this guy got rich, so I want to work hard and get rich. Or maybe you saw a story about someone who lost weight and they got into really good shape, and you say "hey, you know what, I'm inspired. I want to lose weight and I'm going to get into good shape." so many different things could be inspirational, and you know what, at work you could also have people who are inspirational, like your boss.

# 4.sb deserve sth
> 1)"deserve" basically means you should receive something.so when someone deserves something, it means that they should get this because of the way that they behave. So if you do a really good job, then you deserve praise. You deserve to be told that you did a good job.

> 2) some people can feel that way. Another thing you might hear at work, if you think you should be paid more for the good work that you do, you might say something like "you deserve a raise."another examples here, "I don't deserve to be with you." this is more for couples and it means that I am not good enough for you.

# 5.recognition [n.认可，赏识] & to recognize sb's efforts, [v.]
> 1)Recognition, so this here is the noun form of the word "recognize."

> 2)"To recognize" is to notice or understand something. Now we often say, "to recognize someone's efforts," and that means that you, of course, notice and understand that they've been working hard.

> 3)and there' s many ways of giving someone recognition. One way of giving recognition, I just said giving a raise, getting paid more, that's one way of receiving recognition. But there's also like small ways of getting recognition, You could just say things like "good job," or like "great job on the presentation." This is a type of recognition of praise. it's always important to give people recognition when they're at work, especially if their plan is very clear and innovative.You want to acknowledge these people with their good ideas and their hard work.

# 6.innovative [adj.创新的] & innovate [v.]
> 1)So something that is innovative, well it changes something. It's new. It's different.This means to make something better, basically.now companies are always looking for innovative ideas, because innovative ideas really change the company and help it improve.So innovative person usually has innovative ideas, which then might create innovative products.

> 2) It makes me think of the word "invent," a lot of the time, which means to make something new. But when you innovate, you basically take something that already exists, and you make it better. We used to have regular telephones and now it's been turned into the cell phone. So we took the regular phone and then we innovated a bit and made a cell phone.

# 7.give sb a few pointers on sth [n.指示，建议]
> 1)so this here just means like tips or advice.so you could give someone pointers on how to pass an interview, or pointers on how to impress your clients. 

> 2)Just be careful here, we usually say "on" after "pointers." you definitely want to say, "give someone a few pointers on." I'll give one more example, "maybe other host could give me a few pointers on how to dress better."

# 8.appreciate [v.感谢]
> 1)"Appreciate" means I am grateful. I really recognize the value of your words.This is really just going back and forth. It's a lot of recognition between the two of them. By saying "Oh, I appreciate you saying that," he's basically recognizing Mike's kind words.

> 2)We use this a lot when your coworkers are asking you "Oh, what's wrong?" "Are you Ok?" "Do you need any help?" You could say, "No, thank you, but I really appreciate your concern."

> 3)And saying "I appreciate you" or "appreciate this" is just another way of saying thank you.  I could just say "I appreciate everything you've done for us."So anytime that you want to say thank you, you can just use the word "appreciate." 

# 9.strategies
> a strategy is just a plan to achieve a goal.You can have strategies for all kinds of things in life. You can have a business strategy. You can have a strategy for a game that you play. There's a lot of strategy in war.And you can "be strategic with something." Now, to be strategic means to use a strategy. So, if you don't have a lot of money, maybe you have to be strategic with your money. You have to be careful and use a plan.So you have to have a good spending strategy or maybe a good saving strategy, but we also have this phrase here in this sentence, "to take into account" or "took into account."and it means to consider something. For example, if you're traveling, you should probably take the weather into account. If you're thinking about starting a business, you should be realistic and take into account the likelihood of failure.Always an important thing to consider. Or if you're in a relationship, you always have to take the other person's feelings into account.

# 11.constructive [adj.建设性的]
> 1)So constructive is an adjective. It comes from the verb "to construct," which means to build.in this situation, it's kind of like a more formal way of saying helpful. it definitely is. Now in the office you usually hear it with the word criticism, constructive criticism and this is criticism that really helps you improve.

> 2)So maybe your boss will say like, "Do you know what would really help this presentation? Maybe adding more images and decreasing the text." Like this is constructive criticism.Criticism alone can be bad, and it will make you feel bad, and it's not very helpful. But if you give constructive criticism, it's telling you where you could be better but by also giving you advice on how to be better.So just like this right here, this constructive advice is basically just not saying, "Hey, this should be better" or "that should be better," but it's giving a more clear idea on actually how to achieve that goal, how to do it basically.

> 3)So this word "constructive," it means to be helpful but it basically tells you how to do it, and therefore it is helpful.
