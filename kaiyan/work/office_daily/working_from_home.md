# I.How to work from home effectively
> After you've landed a new remote job [远程工作], it's time to consider how to stay productive, creative and live up to the expectations you've set for yourself [实现自己设定的预期] within this new lifestyle. Here are some tips for remote work beginners.

# 1.Over-communicate
> The key to being successful in any professional role is communication, but when it comes to remote work it is an even more important asset. Since you're no longer a few desks down from your coworkers [隔几张桌子] or your manager, it's your job to schedule 1:1 check-in meetings [一对一的会议] with them on a weekly basis to connect on your goals, upcoming projects [即将到来的项目] and daily tasks.

# 2.Invest in reliable tech [购买可靠的科技产品]
> Any remote worker will tell you that access to consistent WiFi is integral /'ɪntɪɡrəl/ [adj.必不可少的] to their success, but there's more to a successful setup [装备] than an internet connection [网络连接].

> Along with having the ability to take video calls without losing connection [视频通话时不掉线], you should consider what tools and tech you'll need to do your job well. For example, many remote workers invest in a great pair of noise-cancelling headphones [降噪耳机] so that they can take their work anywhere--regardless of background noise levels [不管背景噪音有多大]. Others find that wireless keyboards [无线键盘] and mouses, or even a second screen, are integral to [不可或缺] their efficiency.

# 3.Lean on your community [依靠社群]
> One of the major myths /mɪθ/ [误解] surrounding remote work is that people who don't work in a corporate office are lonely. To make sure that you're feeling supported and connected to the "real world," it is recommended that you can become a part of a remote community--either virtually or in-person at a local coworking space [当地的公共办公空间] or collective [集体].

> It is found that being surrounded by others who are successfully working remotely inspires [激励] beginners to stay the course and remain productive while embracing [适应] location flexibility.

# II.Working from home: the pros and cons
> Many people are dreaming of working from home. However, in a Stanford study, 50% of home-based workers asked to return to the office. Here are a few pros and cons of working at home to consider.

# 1.pros
> You'll have greater flexibility. Working at home allows you to adjust your schedule from day to day. Of course, many appreciate the flexibility for more practical reasons[现实原因]: to provide childcare or eldercare [在家照顾孩子和老人] or simply to be at home when the plumber shows up.

> You'll save money. Commuting costs go away[通勤零成本]. Your professional wardrobe goes seriously downscale. Whether you're a business owner or an employee, there are incidental costs to showing up at work five days a week that disappear when you stay home.

# 2.Cons
> Staying motivated isn't easy[很难保持积极性]. Are you an extrovert /ˌɛkstrə'vɝt/ [n.性格外向的人] who thrives on collaborating with others on projects? Do you get energy and inspiration from the kind of impromptu /ɪm'prɑmptu/ [adj. & adv.事先无准备(的), 临时(的)] socializing that occurs among colleagues? If so, the solitary /'sɑlətɛri/ [/'sɑlətɛri/ ] nature of working from home might drain rather than augment your energy.

> There are distractions. Your home circumstances might have built-in distractions. These might include family members or roommates around the house. In any case, if you can't set aside time to devote to work and only work, you can't pull this off.

# III.grammar
# 1.insofar as. & to the extent that... & to the degree that... & as far as...
> 1)This phrase can also be a conjunction and means "to the extent that." In fact, it can even be replaced by the shorter phrase "as far as." The phrase "insofar as" is formal, but if you drop it carefully into a casual conversation, it's great for making you sound smart.It's usually almost always "insofar as," but you may also see "insofar that" followed by another complete clause.

> 2)So this adverbial phrase, "insofar as." "insofar as they can." This is our grammar point for today. It's quite simple. All this phrase means is "to the extent that" or "to the degree that.”"As far as." Actually you can just replace it with "as far as." This phrase is really formal, but if you just slip it into a casual conversation, it's a really great way to make you sound smarter.

> 3)So I could say "insofar as" or "insofar that." For example, "I'll do my best to support you insofar that I am able to." At the same time, I could also say, "I'll do my best to support you insofar as I am able to." The meaning is the same.It also reminds me of this phrase that we say sometimes. When you don't trust somebody, you say, "I trust him as far as I can throw him." Well, you could say that "I trust him insofar as I can throw him."which usually means I don't trust him at all. But we also often add this word "concerned" to this phrase. For example, "we agree insofar as the budget is concerned."

- 1. My friend only reads articles insofar as they support her own ideas.

- 2. I trust him insofar as I can throw him.

- 3. I'll do my best to support you insofar that I'm able to.

- 4.We agree insofar as the budget is concerned.

- 5.There have been a lot of problems insofar as our clients are concerned.

# 2.as though
> 1)"As though," along with it's cousin "as if," is a phrase that is very difficult to explain, but very easy to use. It means "as would be the case if," but it's almost easier to understand it as "like.""As if" is almost easier to understand. Because this really is just an "if" situation. 

> 2)we see the phrase "I'm still dressing as though I were going to work." The person is not going to work, but they are dressing like they are going to work.

> 3)One thing that we really do want to focus on is the tense of the verb that goes after.When you hear native speakers use this phrase, you will hear a lot of different verb tenses. It's quite common to hear people say "as though I am," but it's also common to hear people say "as though I were." The latter is an example of the subjunctive mood [虚拟语气] in English, something that signals a more advanced level of speaking. And it describes an unreal or improbable situation.

> 4)In the dialogue, we see the word "were." "I am dressing as though I were..." Don't ask too many questions about this. This is the smart-person way to say it.But you'll also hear "As if I was..." And you'll even hear people say, 'I'm doing it as though or as if I am going to work."So there's more than one way to use it.

- 1. I feel as though I've become a new person.

- 2. Our little dog is so cute! He always looks as though he were smiling.

- 3. You should always dance as if no one were watching.

# 3.working form home & working at home 
> 1) usually "working from home" is a more temporary situation.

> 2) "working at home" is more permanent. Now, that's not all the time, but that's just the sense that these phrases can give other people.

# 4.work remotely [phr.远程办公] & virtual /'vɝtʃuəl/ meetings 
> 1)it comes from the adjective "remote," which means far away from anything else. for example, you can live in a remote area like a remote village. It's very far away from other people or the city. But, here we're using the adverb and it just means to work from home.or really work anywhere. You could take your computer and go traveling and work remotely that way, too.

> 2) Now there is another way that we use this adverb "remotely," though. It can also mean to have a very, very slight chance, a very slight possibility. so to use the adverb, you could say, "They weren't even remotely interested in our proposal."or "They weren't even remotely aware of the problem," like they weren't even aware at all.

> 3)it just means you're not in the city. You're outside of the city somewhere. It could be even far off in the forest somewhere.It's definitely far off, whether it's on a mountain or in the forest or at the bottom of the sea. Basically just means "from a distance and without any physical contact."

> 4)you can lock your doors remotely and unlock your doors. or you can even control another computer remotely through your computer. so these are words that we often use with "remotely," "control." In fact, there is a thing called "a remote control." That is a pretty common thing to have in your home.

> 5)"Virtual meetings." Yeah, almost anything we do online can be described as "virtual" something. Here in Vancouver, a lot of people that buy homes or apartments will first take a virtual tour. So someone will just take out their iPhone, and you know, I just give someone a look at this apartment.

# 5.leveraging [ptcp:利用]
> 1)So they're doing this is by leveraging their collaboration tools. this is a really great word, and it means using something that you already have to help you, to give you an advantage.here they're leveraging tools to mitigate the problem of not having face-to-face interactions, but something that companies also do is they leverage their connections. So they use the connections that they have.

> 2)here we're talking about utilizing or using something that you already have. And this is a really good way to, you know, reduce that problem, but Kelly, she's still a little skeptical. So, she has this question, "Weren't you more productive in an office?"

# 6.constraints [n.制约、约束]
> 1)So "constraints" are things that limit you. A productivity constraint is something that limits your productivity.it's like a barrier to keep you within a limit, kind of a limitation. And constrain is the verb. So maybe you want to buy a house but you are constrained by your income. So that's a financial constraint.

> 2)and we have lots of constraints at work, so our work policies can constrain us. Now, the thing about constrain is it's always negative,if it's unintentional. Another example at the office could be something as simple as the temperature. Maybe it's too hot or too cold at the office, and it really constrains your productivity.Or sometimes working in a cubicle /'kjubɪkl/ [] can really constrain your productivity. For that reason, a lot of people prefer open-concept offices.

# 7.slacking off [phr.偷懒、懈怠] & cut sb some slack & slacker [n.]
> 1)the word "slack" means loose and not tight.so "slacking off." To "slack off" means to be a little lazy, to not work very hard.Less effort. More slowly. But when we're at work, we shouldn't slack off, even though everyone does. on Friday, everyone slacks off a little bit. Or if people are a little bit hungover, they might be slacking off in the morning.

> 2) We often say cut someone some slack, treat them more leniently. Don't be so strict with them.

> 3)but the main thing is you just don't want to be a "slacker." This is a person who doesn't work hard most of the time.

# 8.camaraderie /ˌkɑmə'rɑdəri/ [n.同志之爱,友情]
> So "camaraderie" is a kind of feeling of friendship and trust between people. I kind of feel like the entire world has a sense of camaraderie because of the coronavirus. It's like we're all physically apart, but our feeling is that we're all in this together. There's a sense of oneness /'wʌnnəs/ [n.统一性;单一性] there.

> camaraderie. And this is really important in companies, in schools, you know, in just communities in general. You want to build that camaraderie. But if you're not in the office, sometimes that can be difficult to develop.

# 9.retreats [n.静修期间（或活动）] & go on a treat
> 1)retreat." This is a noun here. It's from a word that armies and soldiers used in the past, which means "run away."It's from a word that armies and soldiers used in the past, which means "run away."Usually, we use it as a noun, and it means kind of a vacation. It's a chance to get away from our busy lives.usually to a place where we can think and be introspective and relax. 

> 2)And so the verb we use is "go on a retreat." "We went on a retreat." and often companies have these team-building retreats where you can build camaraderie.

# 10.working out the kinks [phr.解决问题]
> 1)"Working out" in this phrase does not mean exercise. It means "solve," "solve the problems." Like, sometimes you might hear couples, they often try to work out their differences.

> 2)And "kinks" here, we use it to refer to the little problems.A kink is a twist or a bend in a, in a pipe, but here it just means little problems that we can fix easily, and often there are many little kinks that we have to work out.

# 11.tap into [phr.发掘、进入、利用]
> 1)"tap into" means to utilize resources.So, you could tap into your oil resources, Or you can even tap into your workforce. That is also a resource.so that's sort of the original meaning, but we often use it to talk about our creativity, or our our talent, or our energy. If I just went on another retreat, I could tap into my creativity.

> 2)Parents are always trying to get their kids to tap into their creativity by signing them up for music or art lessons.working from home really helps companies tap into a large global talent pool, and "pool" here just means, like, a big quantity of things. or a big quantity of people here.

# 12.hybrid [n.混合物]
> 1)so "hybrid" here means some combination of it. So a hybrid is a mix of two different things. For example, we have hybrid cars and they use a mix of gas and electricity.Even your average garden strawberry is a hybrid plant. It's made of two different types of plants.

> 2)Or there's a lot of different hybrid genres/'ʒɔŋrə/ [n.种类；体裁；流派] , like hybrid genres of music. Maybe it's rap, but it's also R&B.there're so many hybrid music genres, yeah. I can't even count them. So maybe in the future, companies will have working from home and working at the office, some kind of a hybrid version of that. But Kelly says that, well, regardless of how companies do it, "the world's gonna look a lot different in ten years."

# 13.flexibility & stubborn
> 1)so "flexibility." This comes from the adjective "flexible," and something that is "flexible" can be changed. For example, you could have "a flexible schedule" or you could have "flexible work hours."and you can use this word for people as well. A person can be really flexible. The opposite of that is "inflexible" or "stubborn."

> 2)"having flexibility at work," though. That usually means that maybe you can work at different hours. Maybe you have a flexible work schedule. Or maybe the projects that you get to work on are flexible. Maybe you can change things or make decisions.

# 14.mitigate [v.缓和]
> 1)So to "mitigate" something is to reduce the damage. You reduce the problems or the risk.You make it less severe. A common example that we see again and again is that governments are trying to mitigate the effects of climate change. 

> 2)or "mitigate losses." Companies are always trying to mitigate losses. For example, if a restaurant isn't doing so well, they will lay off some workers to mitigate their losses. They will mitigate that loss of profit.

# 15.roll out of bed [phr.起床] & commute /kə'mjʊt/ [n.通勤、上下班时间] & slobs /slɑb/ [n.懒散邋遢的人] & sloppy [adj.]
> 1)"roll out of bed" give me that impression of "I don't care what time it is. It's very casual. I just slept in for an hour."So, because he's not having to wake up early to travel to work, Jack can just kind of wake up anytime he wants.

> 2)a commute is just the amount of time it takes us to go from our house to our office and our office to our house.

> 3)Basically a slob is someone who's lazy and just kind of messy. If you stay in your pajamas all day, I mean you're kinda lazy. It doesn't mean you're necessarily messy, but people might still describe you as a slob. And Jack says, "At first, people were in their pajamas and relying on app filters /filtə/ [n.滤镜], but they're getting better."

> 4) We have an adjective form of this word, too, which is sloppy.

# 16.stay on track [phr.保持前进、保持进展] & keep on track
> 1) so "on track" basically means going in the right direction. you don't want to get off track. That means you're distracted. You're not focusing. It's kind of like the phrase we saw earlier, "to stick to it."

> 2)There's no difference. You can say both. "I had to stay on track. I had to keep on track so that I could get the job done."

# 17.phone it in [phr.敷衍了事]
> To phone something" basically means to make the least effort possible or to do something without any enthusiasm.But you can use this phrase whenever you're talking about your job. Maybe you're not really working very hard at all. "Jeez, Tom really phoned it in today."

# IV.pattern
***Hey, Matt. I heard your new job lets you work remotely.***

***Yeah, I'm loving it. It's great having flexibility and autonomy over my work.***

***That's great! Isn't it hard without face-to-face interactions, though?***

***We mitigate that pretty well by leveraging collaboration tools we already had, like Slack and Zoom.***

***That's cool. Weren't you more productive in an office?***

***Not at all. Offices have lots of productivity constraints. And, since we're judged only on our output, it actually keeps people from slacking off.***

***Interesting. I still like the camaraderie you get from being with coworkers.***

***As long as you like your coworkers! We do have a physical office we can visit, and we have team-building retreats as well.***

***Seems like they're working out the kinks. I can definitely see that it lets companies tap into a far bigger global talent pool.***

***I think it's going to look like a different world in ten years!***

# IV.pattern
***Jack, I heard that you're working from home these days.***

***Yeah, the whole team has been working remotely for a while now.***

***Are you finding it easy to adjust?***

***Well it's nice to roll out of bed a bit later and not have to worry about the commute.***

***No doubt! Although I'd imagine it's hard to stay productive all day long.***

***It's easy to get distracted, sure. But I have my routine and I stick to it.***

***You probably don't have to worry about your physical appearance though, right?***

***I'm still dressing as though I were going to work. It helps me to stay on track.***

***A lot of workers must attend virtual meetings dressed like slobs.***

***At first people were in their pajamas and relying on app filters, but they're getting better.***

***I guess the lesson is, don't phone it in, even when you're phoning it in!***
