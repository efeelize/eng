# I.How to work from home effectively
> After you've landed a new remote job [远程工作], it's time to consider how to stay productive, creative and live up to the expectations you've set for yourself [实现自己设定的预期] within this new lifestyle. Here are some tips for remote work beginners.

# 1.Over-communicate
> The key to being successful in any professional role is communication, but when it comes to remote work it is an even more important asset. Since you're no longer a few desks down from your coworkers [隔几张桌子] or your manager, it's your job to schedule 1:1 check-in meetings [一对一的会议] with them on a weekly basis to connect on your goals, upcoming projects [即将到来的项目] and daily tasks.

# 2.Invest in reliable tech [购买可靠的科技产品]
> Any remote worker will tell you that access to consistent WiFi is integral /'ɪntɪɡrəl/ [adj.必不可少的] to their success, but there's more to a successful setup [装备] than an internet connection [网络连接].

> Along with having the ability to take video calls without losing connection [视频通话时不掉线], you should consider what tools and tech you'll need to do your job well. For example, many remote workers invest in a great pair of noise-cancelling headphones [降噪耳机] so that they can take their work anywhere--regardless of background noise levels [不管背景噪音有多大]. Others find that wireless keyboards [无线键盘] and mouses, or even a second screen, are integral to [不可或缺] their efficiency.

# 3.Lean on your community [依靠社群]
> One of the major myths /mɪθ/ [误解] surrounding remote work is that people who don't work in a corporate office are lonely. To make sure that you're feeling supported and connected to the "real world," it is recommended that you can become a part of a remote community--either virtually or in-person at a local coworking space [当地的公共办公空间] or collective [集体].

> It is found that being surrounded by others who are successfully working remotely inspires [激励] beginners to stay the course and remain productive while embracing [适应] location flexibility.

# II.grammar
# 1.insofar as. & to the extent that... & to the degree that... & as far as...
> 1)This phrase can also be a conjunction and means "to the extent that." In fact, it can even be replaced by the shorter phrase "as far as." The phrase "insofar as" is formal, but if you drop it carefully into a casual conversation, it's great for making you sound smart.It's usually almost always "insofar as," but you may also see "insofar that" followed by another complete clause.

> 2)So this adverbial phrase, "insofar as." "insofar as they can." This is our grammar point for today. It's quite simple. All this phrase means is "to the extent that" or "to the degree that.”"As far as." Actually you can just replace it with "as far as." This phrase is really formal, but if you just slip it into a casual conversation, it's a really great way to make you sound smarter.

> 3)So I could say "insofar as" or "insofar that." For example, "I'll do my best to support you insofar that I am able to." At the same time, I could also say, "I'll do my best to support you insofar as I am able to." The meaning is the same.It also reminds me of this phrase that we say sometimes. When you don't trust somebody, you say, "I trust him as far as I can throw him." Well, you could say that "I trust him insofar as I can throw him."which usually means I don't trust him at all. But we also often add this word "concerned" to this phrase. For example, "we agree insofar as the budget is concerned."

- 1. My friend only reads articles insofar as they support her own ideas.

- 2. I trust him insofar as I can throw him.

- 3. I'll do my best to support you insofar that I'm able to.

- 4.We agree insofar as the budget is concerned.

- 5.There have been a lot of problems insofar as our clients are concerned.

# 2.work remotely [phr.远程办公]
> 1)it comes from the adjective "remote," which means far away from anything else. for example, you can live in a remote area like a remote village. It's very far away from other people or the city. But, here we're using the adverb and it just means to work from home.or really work anywhere. You could take your computer and go traveling and work remotely that way, too.

> 2) Now there is another way that we use this adverb "remotely," though. It can also mean to have a very, very slight chance, a very slight possibility. so to use the adverb, you could say, "They weren't even remotely interested in our proposal."or "They weren't even remotely aware of the problem," like they weren't even aware at all.

# 3.flexibility & stubborn
> 1)so "flexibility." This comes from the adjective "flexible," and something that is "flexible" can be changed. For example, you could have "a flexible schedule" or you could have "flexible work hours."and you can use this word for people as well. A person can be really flexible. The opposite of that is "inflexible" or "stubborn."

> 2)"having flexibility at work," though. That usually means that maybe you can work at different hours. Maybe you have a flexible work schedule. Or maybe the projects that you get to work on are flexible. Maybe you can change things or make decisions.

# 4.mitigate [v.缓和]
> 1)So to "mitigate" something is to reduce the damage. You reduce the problems or the risk.You make it less severe. A common example that we see again and again is that governments are trying to mitigate the effects of climate change. 

> 2)or "mitigate losses." Companies are always trying to mitigate losses. For example, if a restaurant isn't doing so well, they will lay off some workers to mitigate their losses. They will mitigate that loss of profit.

# 5.leveraging [ptcp:利用]
> 1)So they're doing this is by leveraging their collaboration tools. this is a really great word, and it means using something that you already have to help you, to give you an advantage.here they're leveraging tools to mitigate the problem of not having face-to-face interactions, but something that companies also do is they leverage their connections. So they use the connections that they have.

> 2)here we're talking about utilizing or using something that you already have. And this is a really good way to, you know, reduce that problem, but Kelly, she's still a little skeptical. So, she has this question, "Weren't you more productive in an office?"

# 6.constraints [n.制约、约束]
> 1)So "constraints" are things that limit you. A productivity constraint is something that limits your productivity.it's like a barrier to keep you within a limit, kind of a limitation. And constrain is the verb. So maybe you want to buy a house but you are constrained by your income. So that's a financial constraint.

> 2)and we have lots of constraints at work, so our work policies can constrain us. Now, the thing about constrain is it's always negative,if it's unintentional. Another example at the office could be something as simple as the temperature. Maybe it's too hot or too cold at the office, and it really constrains your productivity.Or sometimes working in a cubicle /'kjubɪkl/ [] can really constrain your productivity. For that reason, a lot of people prefer open-concept offices.

# 7.slacking off [phr.偷懒、懈怠] & cut sb some slack & slacker [n.]
> 1)the word "slack" means loose and not tight.so "slacking off." To "slack off" means to be a little lazy, to not work very hard.Less effort. More slowly. But when we're at work, we shouldn't slack off, even though everyone does. on Friday, everyone slacks off a little bit. Or if people are a little bit hungover, they might be slacking off in the morning.

> 2) We often say cut someone some slack, treat them more leniently. Don't be so strict with them.

> 3)but the main thing is you just don't want to be a "slacker." This is a person who doesn't work hard most of the time.

# 8.camaraderie /ˌkɑmə'rɑdəri/ [n.同志之爱,友情]
> So "camaraderie" is a kind of feeling of friendship and trust between people. I kind of feel like the entire world has a sense of camaraderie because of the coronavirus. It's like we're all physically apart, but our feeling is that we're all in this together. There's a sense of oneness /'wʌnnəs/ [n.统一性;单一性] there.

> camaraderie. And this is really important in companies, in schools, you know, in just communities in general. You want to build that camaraderie. But if you're not in the office, sometimes that can be difficult to develop.

# 9.retreats [n.静修期间（或活动）] & go on a treat
> 1)retreat." This is a noun here. It's from a word that armies and soldiers used in the past, which means "run away."It's from a word that armies and soldiers used in the past, which means "run away."Usually, we use it as a noun, and it means kind of a vacation. It's a chance to get away from our busy lives.usually to a place where we can think and be introspective and relax. 

> 2)And so the verb we use is "go on a retreat." "We went on a retreat." and often companies have these team-building retreats where you can build camaraderie.

# 10.working out the kinks [phr.解决问题]
> 1)"Working out" in this phrase does not mean exercise. It means "solve," "solve the problems." Like, sometimes you might hear couples, they often try to work out their differences.

> 2)And "kinks" here, we use it to refer to the little problems.A kink is a twist or a bend in a, in a pipe, but here it just means little problems that we can fix easily, and often there are many little kinks that we have to work out.

# 11.tap into [phr.发掘、进入、利用]
> 1)"tap into" means to utilize resources.So, you could tap into your oil resources, Or you can even tap into your workforce. That is also a resource.so that's sort of the original meaning, but we often use it to talk about our creativity, or our our talent, or our energy. If I just went on another retreat, I could tap into my creativity.

> 2)Parents are always trying to get their kids to tap into their creativity by signing them up for music or art lessons.working from home really helps companies tap into a large global talent pool, and "pool" here just means, like, a big quantity of things. or a big quantity of people here.

# 12.hybrid [n.混合物]
> 1)so "hybrid" here means some combination of it. So a hybrid is a mix of two different things. For example, we have hybrid cars and they use a mix of gas and electricity.Even your average garden strawberry is a hybrid plant. It's made of two different types of plants.

> 2)Or there's a lot of different hybrid genres/'ʒɔŋrə/ [n.种类；体裁；流派] , like hybrid genres of music. Maybe it's rap, but it's also R&B.there're so many hybrid music genres, yeah. I can't even count them. So maybe in the future, companies will have working from home and working at the office, some kind of a hybrid version of that. But Kelly says that, well, regardless of how companies do it, "the world's gonna look a lot different in ten years."

# III.pattern
***Hey, Matt. I heard your new job lets you work remotely.***

***Yeah, I'm loving it. It's great having flexibility and autonomy over my work.***

***That's great! Isn't it hard without face-to-face interactions, though?***

***We mitigate that pretty well by leveraging collaboration tools we already had, like Slack and Zoom.***

***That's cool. Weren't you more productive in an office?***

***Not at all. Offices have lots of productivity constraints. And, since we're judged only on our output, it actually keeps people from slacking off.***

*** Interesting. I still like the camaraderie you get from being with coworkers.***

***As long as you like your coworkers! We do have a physical office we can visit, and we have team-building retreats as well.***

***Seems like they're working out the kinks. I can definitely see that it lets companies tap into a far bigger global talent pool.***

***I think it's going to look like a different world in ten years!***
