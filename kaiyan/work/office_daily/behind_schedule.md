# Behind_schedule
# I.What to do when you are behind schedule？
> Depending on the reasons why the project is behind schedule, your options vary. The methods listed here can help you work out a best solution in a multicultural environment. 

# 1.Do overtime or extend the deadline
> When the delay is minor, overtime[加班] is what you need in order to get back on track. If the delay isn't minor and/or overtime is not an option, you could try to extend the deadline, especially when the delay is the result of an unavoidable accident nobody could have predicted[发生众人意料之外的突发状况].

# 2.Change the scope
> If it turns out that a particular task requires much more effort than what you have initially [最初] estimated, or if the task is not as vital as it was originally deemed to be, then you can exclude[剔除] it from the project scope and still make it on time. However, don't forget to get the approval before you make the rescheduling.

# 3.Include more resources
> If the project permits it, you can ask other departments for help or assign more people to the project. But always bear in mind: When new people come into the project, they need to be trained first and get acquainted /ə'kwentɪd/ [adj.了解，知晓] with the project.

# II.grammar
# 1.wrap /ræp/ up [phr.结束]
> "wrap up", this means to end the meeting.Right, to finish or like you say end something, like you can wrap up a project.Or you can wrap up a speech.Basically anything that you're doing, like if you're playing a game, huh, I'm getting tired, let's wrap it up.And it is casual, so you don't want to use it in writing, but it's perfectly fine in a meeting.

# 2.bring me up to speed [phr.告知我最新情况]
> 1）And this means can you fill me in, can you tell me the information that I am missing.Because he doesn't know something, he wants the other person to let him know.And in this situation, giving you more information will help you catch up to everyone else.So we always use this phrase, if you didn't attend a meeting.Or if you're sick and you didn't go to work, you can also say "can you bring me up to speed".

> 2)Yeah, but what do we use the word "speed"?Well, probably because in a race, if you're behind, you need to catch up, you need to gain more speed.

# 3.behind schedule [phr.进度落后] & ahead of schedule & on schedule [phr.按时] & on time
> 1)To be behind schedule means that you are late on something.Yeah, the schedule has deadlines, and when you don't meet those deadlines, you are behind schedule. And this is a common phrase: "behind schedule".For example, I might say "oh sorry, I'm behind schedule. Can we change the date of the meeting?"So this is when we're talking about schedules, this is very common. 

> 2)The opposite phrase is "ahead of schedule".Yeah, and that means you actually finish things early.Too fast, so slow down.

> 3)And this means that you are on time, you were following the schedule.

> 4)Right. Now it's a little bit different than "on time", like for example, I can arrive to work on time, but how is this a little bit different than that?A schedule is usually a series of deadlines, right? So you need to finish this this week, you need to finish the second part by next week. And maybe you have something else to do in the third week.

# 4.ran into [phr.遇到]
> It's kind of like running into a wall, but not that actually. It's when you come across or encounter something that makes you stop.Yeah, it's when you find something unexpectedly.Exactly. I remember one time I was traveling in Europe, and I ran into a friend.Or well, I mean, you could even just run into a friend at a store.That's true. So in that way, it can be a good thing. In this case, it's not a good thing.Yeah, so they ran into some issues, right? She unexpectedly found some issues.Some problems, exactly. So that's why they're behind schedule, but this is a problem as Kevin says, "well we'd better get those numbers right".

# 5.we'd better
> It means we had better and like you say, it's for giving some strong advice in a kind of casual polite way.we'd better" and this means we should, it would be better for us if we did this."We'd", it's "W E apostrophe /ə'pɑstrəfi/ [n.省略] D". Exactly, so for example, I might say "we've got a lot of work to do, we'd better come in early".Oh yeah, or "we'd better double-check the schedule".

> The phrase “had better” + VERB is used to tell people what they should do or what we want to happen. It can be used to talk about the present or future, and is more common in spoken English.短语“had better+动词”经常用来告诉人们他们应该做什么或者我们希望什么事情发生。这个搭配可以用来说现在或者未来的事，经常用于英语口语中。

> This form is always written “had better,” never “have better.” There is also no “to” before the verb. Finally, it’s usually shortened to “ 'd better .”这个短语经常写成“had better”，而不是“have better”。后面直接接动词不加“to”。“had better”经常缩写为“ 'd better ”。

# 6.push back [phr.延后] & extend & delay
> so this phrase "push back" just means extend or delay.Yeah, move it back. For example, if we are late on something, we might need to push back a meeting, we might need to move from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m.Exactly, so you can push back a meeting, a deadline, a vacation, anything that's in your schedule.

# 7.tight [adj.金钱拮据的]
> 1)She says "it's going to be tight", which means that the schedule will be tight.Yeah, not your clothes. I mean, I mean my clothes are already pretty tight. Yeah this means you don't have enough time, maybe not enough time.

> 2)Yeah, so that's the key thing here, not enough. So we might have a tight budget, right? You might not have enough money.

> 3)Or if I'm cooking dinner for all my friends, and they say "Do you have enough ingredients?" and I say "Oh, I don't know. It's going to be tight".

# 8.can't afford to 
> 1)So we can't afford to. "Afford" is usually used with money, but here it actually means that we cannot do this, because it will cause problems.If you're not studying very hard lately and you failed some tests, maybe the next time you can't afford not to study because then you're going to fail another test.

> 2)Right, so the opposite would be if you can afford something, like you can afford to delay something, it means you can do that and it won't make any problems.For example, if I wake up really early, so I have a lot of time to get to work, so I can afford to sit there and have a coffee.

# 9.occupied [adj.忙碌的]
> 1)Busy, that's all this means, like if someone's really busy because of work, you could say "I've been occupied with my work".

> 2)Yeah, or you could be occupied with the kids.Oh yes. If you see little babies using their parents' iPhones, the kids are very occupied, it's taking all of their attention.

> 3)Yeah and also when you're in the washroom, right, sometimes you see this little sign, "occupied", it means that someone's in the washroom.Yeah, it's a polite way to say someone's in the bathroom, the bathroom is occupied.

# 10.assign [v.安排]
> 1)That's what this means, "assign somebody". For example, a teacher assigns homework to students.

> 2)Yeah, or bosses always assign tasks to the employees.

> 3)For example, a boss can assign a day to have interviews.

# 11.hiccups /'hikʌp/ [n.小问题、打嗝]
> 1）It just means a little problem.So we're not really going to use it for big problems. For example, travel hiccups, right? A travel hiccup might be that there is a traffic jam.

> 2)Now, a hiccup, the original meaning of a hiccup is when you you you're talking and and this annoying sound that keeps you from talking in finishing a sentence.

# 12.make this deadline [phr.赶上进度] & make a meeting
> 1)This does not mean set a deadline. This means finish before the deadline or meet the deadline.

> 2)It's similar to saying make a meeting, right? So if you make the meeting, then you show up for the meeting on time.Yeah, usually when it's difficult to be on time, like "Oh, I don't know if I can make it on time".Or "I can't make it to the party, sorry".
