# Communication_trouble at work

# I.The art of open communication 
> In today's lesson, Anna and Matt openly talked about issues at work. Anna started off with her concern over Matt's work performance. Matt then honestly spoke about the reasons and asked for help. 

> Transparency has become an important aspect of work culture in America. There is less hierarchy, what some people like to call flat hierarchy. Employees are encouraged to freely speak to their managers about problems they may be facing, and similarly, managers will talk about obstacles and concerns to their employees too.

> Even though open communication is widely acceptable and highly encouraged, the style of communication is equally important. 

> Notice how Anna said to Matt "Don't take this the wrong way" before she talked about her concern over his performance. Indeed, phrases like "Don't take this the wrong way" or "don't take it personally" are commonly used before presenting critical ideas. 

# II.grammar
# 1.to keep sb from doing something
> To keep someone from doing something basically just means like "prevent" or "stop".You can use this pattern anytime you want to describe something that is hindering someone from doing something else.[广泛的阻碍]

- Parents shouldn't keep their children from making mistakes;it's how we all learn and grow.
- She's trying to keep her husband from eating dessert,but that's only going to make him crave them more.
- This nasty cold has been keeping me from leaving the house.
- My parents alwasys told me that they 'll never keep me from doing what I truly love.
- Constant calls and emails are keeping me from getting work done.

# 2.top from [phr.最好的状态]
> Yeah. This almost sounds like an athlete.I was thinking the same thing, right? If an Olympic athlete is in top form... well, they are, they're all pretty much in top form.You know, they're in the best shape, and they're doing their best.

# 3.don't take this wrong way,but...
> it's basically you can use this when you want to tell somebody something that you think might upset them." Please don't take this the wrong way." And that's always a funny little expression because it, it's always followed by "but".

# 4.brought that up [v.提出]
> 1)Brought that up, bring something up. It just means to start talking about something.Yeah. Basically to kind of, maybe spark a conversation about a certain topic.

> 2)You know, sometimes you could suggest to someone not to bring something up.Yeah. Like "Do not bring up your friend's affair...."

# 5.workload [n.工作量]
> The workload is just the amount of work you have to do.Sure. And you could say, you could also describe it as, like a heavy workload, or a light workload.Yeah. "I know I don't have a whole lot going on that's super busy, the workload is pretty light."Yeah. Or "I'm swamped./swɑmp/ [v.陷入泥沼] I have way too much work." The workload is too much to deal with.

# 6.keep up [phr.跟上] 
> 1)It just means, just, Spencer just said "get everything done".Yeah. We also say:"To stay on top."Yeah, stay on top of things.Sure. So maybe when your workload is very light, it's very easy to keep up. But then as it increases and increases, it becomes harder and harder to keep up.

> 2)Yeah, another thing we use "keep up" for is like, like if you're in, like, a race or let's say, I don't know, let's say you like to go jogging with friends, and you are not in as good of shape as your friend. He can run or she can run more than you, you know, faster than you.So it might be difficult for you to keep up with your friends.Because they can run more.

# 7.stepping up {to the plate } [phr.挺身而书、接受挑战]
> Stepping up here is just like doing more.Yeah. We also say, we have a lot of, you know, sports metaphors /'mɛtəfɚ/ [n.隐喻] in English. You know, so we say step up to the plate, you know, with baseball.So take responsibility, basically.Yeah. You say, I don't know, you're a grown man and you have a child now, you really need to step up and take responsibility for your children.

# 8.impactful [adj.有影响的] & junior [adj.资历浅的] & senior 
> 1)Yeah. Things with impact, things that mean something.things that matter.

> 2)So junior, you might know, means like son or a kid or lower.so "junior" here, when applied to the work realm, basically means someone who is more, well, low-level.

> 3)senior,what we call someone who's been at the company for a long time.

# 9.push for [phr.争取]
> push for, or to advocate for, to support, yeah, exactly.Well, just at the office, other things you could push for, you know, a longer break.

# III.pattern
***Matt, could I speak to you privately for a minute?***

***Could I speak to you in private?***

***Well, please don't take this the wrong way.  I've noticed that you haven't really been in top form at work lately.***

***Ah, I'm really glad you brought that up, because I am indeed having some challenges at work.***

***Ok. Do you mind sharing those with me?***

***Certainly. My workload has increased quite significantly as our business has been growing. I'm really excited about the new opportunities. But at the same time, I'm struggling to keep up.***

***Matt, I really appreciate you stepping up as we grow. Now, how can I help and make things easier for you?***

***Well, I'm spending a lot of time on low-level tasks, which is keeping me from doing more impactful things. I really feel that I could add more value to the company if those tasks were done by someone more junior.***

***Um, I do agree with you. At the moment, we don't really have the people to support you. But I'll make sure to bring the issue up at the next management meeting and push for more resources for the team.***

***Thanks Anna! I appreciate it.***

***No problem. In the meantime, if I can help with anything you're working on, please let me know.***

***Thank you. I'll do my best to keep up.***
