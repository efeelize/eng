# I.Tips on how to give clear, understandable instructions
> Giving clear understandable instructions is one of those things that sounds easy to do but in real life can actually be more complex. Here are several tips on how to give instructions that are clear and get the job done that you want.

# 1. Don’t assume they know what you mean
> An imperative /ɪm'pɛrətɪv/ [adj.必要的] when delivering clear instructions is to not assume the recipient knows what you mean, and this can be for anything from industry acronyms /'ækrənɪm/ [n.首字母缩略词] to who to contact in different departments or organizations [跨部门跨组织联系他人时].

# 2. Be clear and specific
> For example, don’t just instruct “send a selection of the briefings to a few key stakeholders [主要股东]”, instead state how many stakeholders and to who, and what briefings.

# 3. Give time frames /frem/ [范围]
> Do not confuse matters by not being specific with your time frames and deadlines. What you consider as “soon” might be very different from your colleagues.

# 4. Give examples
> Whenever possible, make sure you give examples. This will be especially beneficial if they are new to the role, or if they haven’t carried out the task before.
