# Instructions_workflow
# I.Tips on how to give clear, understandable instructions
> Giving clear understandable instructions is one of those things that sounds easy to do but in real life can actually be more complex. Here are several tips on how to give instructions that are clear and get the job done that you want.

# 1. Don’t assume they know what you mean
> An imperative /ɪm'pɛrətɪv/ [adj.必要的] when delivering clear instructions is to not assume the recipient knows what you mean, and this can be for anything from industry acronyms /'ækrənɪm/ [n.首字母缩略词] to who to contact in different departments or organizations [跨部门跨组织联系他人时].

# 2. Be clear and specific
> For example, don’t just instruct “send a selection of the briefings to a few key stakeholders [主要股东]”, instead state how many stakeholders and to who, and what briefings.

# 3. Give time frames /frem/ [范围]
> Do not confuse matters by not being specific with your time frames and deadlines. What you consider as “soon” might be very different from your colleagues.

# 4. Give examples
> Whenever possible, make sure you give examples. This will be especially beneficial if they are new to the role, or if they haven’t carried out the task before.

# I.Is micromanaging bad for your office?
> Micromanage is a word with almost zero positive connotations in English. And it's easy to understand why: who hasn't had a boss constantly breathing down their neck about something [挑毛病] at work? Or more simply, who hasn't had a boss that just doesn't give them the space to do their job? Doesn't this affect productivity, both at the individual, and the company level?

> As annoying as it can be, there are times when micromanaging becomes necessary. And we're not talking about the kind of employees that need a bit more guidance from or control by the manager. No, we mean times when the higher-ups [领导层] needs to play a larger role in ensuring that the workflow remains smooth. For example, during times when the company is changing direction or strategy [调整战略方向], or during a major leadership shake-up, it's easy to imagine coordination becoming harder and harder.

> On the other hand, when things are running more smoothly, that's when the manager needs to ease up on the micromanaging. This is the time when the best managers give their employees the space to create and grow.

> So, the next time someone tells you that micromanaging is a negative thing, you can tell them that it's not always as bad as it sounds. Remember, at the end of the day, micromanaging is still managing.

# II.grammar
# 1 give instructions or advice 
## 1）Before you even begin... [正式开始前...]
> And it basically is a more intermediate fancy way to say "first".And also this phrase "before you even begin", it highlights how important this is.

- Before you even begin, you should create a list of all the equipment in the meeting room.

## 2)After that’s taken care of... 这件事做完后......

## 3)Don’t forget to... 不要忘记...... 
- Don't forget to keep the receipts so that you can send them for reimbursement later.

## 4)Once… 一旦......
> So the boss is saying "once we have those in place", meaning after those are, you know, set up and they're scheduled, they can move on to the next stage of planning this event, which is the marketing campaign.

- Once that's all done, you'll need to contact the caterer to arrange for the snacks.

# 2.prefixes:Micro- & macro- 
> 1)Micro- means small or reduced, whereas Macro- usually talks about the bigger picture or large-scale. The most common examples of micro- and macro- come from the field of economics. Generally speaking microeconomics refers to the study of individuals and business decisions, whereas macroeconomics focuses on higher-up country and government decisions. 

> 2)There is microeconomics, and macroeconomics.So macro would deal with bigger, maybe like societal trends in economics.Micro could be much smaller, focusing on like a smaller area in economics.Supply and demand, that's kind of stuff.

> 2)a signing is kind of more just like the action, or giving to somebody, we could think about it as, delegate is like the idea, and assign is the actual action.Delegating takes a little more thought and just assigning. But assigning you do after carefully having decided to delegate.

Go kill this guy and then kill that guy, and come back to Rome and kill all the guys.If you want to be the president or even the mayor /'meɚ/ [n.市长], you need to run a campaign.

## 1)shortlist [n.候选名单]
> So a shortlist might have like, three or four people maybe.And then from that shortlist you have to choose. It's easier to choose from say four people rather than fourteen people.

## 2)put out [phr.发布、张贴、给、发表]
> 1) "put out", it's when you do something, you put it out there for others to see it.And when you are finding employees or staff for any kind of event, or any kind of workplace really, you usually put out an ad.you are actually putting something that you want people to find, you want them to see.

## 3)keynote speakers/speech/address
> 1)so conferences, seminars, even some big types of meetings, not all meetings, they will often have keynote speakers. And a keynote speaker, in this case, is the most important speaker, the most important person.

> 2)So the keynote is the most important part of anything. It could be a keynote speaker, in this case, could also be a keynote speech,or a keynote address.

## 4)venue [n.场地]
> so a venue is just a place where an event happens.and a venue can be small, can be big, can be a sports stadium.Or a tiny little restaurant. It's just like a place where an event happens.But we wouldn't say that for, like meeting our friends, like, "where is our venue for meeting this Saturday".

## 5)action items
> So "action items", these are the things that need to get done, the things that people need to do. So for example, if Jessica has to contact a few clients by the end of the week, then that's an action item she has to do it by the end of the week.

# 5.I'll see to that [phr.确保完成]
> it just means make sure.I'll ensure that happens.

# 6.bumped up [phr.增加、扩充] & expanding [扩张]

# 7.buffer [n. & v.缓冲]
> so buff can just means strong,muscular.but buffer is a space or a time that will protect you.that will give you some insurance.so here we're talking about production buffer. so they're talking about a 2 or 3 day buffer. So basically it means, they have 2 or 3 days to kind of work with, to make sure that everything is okay.
