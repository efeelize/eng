# I.Tips on how to give clear, understandable instructions
> Giving clear understandable instructions is one of those things that sounds easy to do but in real life can actually be more complex. Here are several tips on how to give instructions that are clear and get the job done that you want.

# 1. Don’t assume they know what you mean
> An imperative /ɪm'pɛrətɪv/ [adj.必要的] when delivering clear instructions is to not assume the recipient knows what you mean, and this can be for anything from industry acronyms /'ækrənɪm/ [n.首字母缩略词] to who to contact in different departments or organizations [跨部门跨组织联系他人时].

# 2. Be clear and specific
> For example, don’t just instruct “send a selection of the briefings to a few key stakeholders [主要股东]”, instead state how many stakeholders and to who, and what briefings.

# 3. Give time frames /frem/ [范围]
> Do not confuse matters by not being specific with your time frames and deadlines. What you consider as “soon” might be very different from your colleagues.

# 4. Give examples
> Whenever possible, make sure you give examples. This will be especially beneficial if they are new to the role, or if they haven’t carried out the task before.

# II.grammar
# 1 give instructions or advice at work or in your everyday conversations
## 1）Before you even begin... [正式开始前...]
> And it basically is a more intermediate fancy way to say "first".And also this phrase "before you even begin", it highlights how important this is.

- Before you even begin, you should create a list of all the equipment in the meeting room.

## 2)After that’s taken care of... 这件事做完后...... 
- After that's taken care of, you can arrange for the missing items to be rented for the duration of the conference.

## 3)Don’t forget to... 不要忘记...... 
- Don't forget to keep the receipts so that you can send them for reimbursement later.

## 4)Once… 一旦......
> So the boss is saying "once we have those in place", meaning after those are, you know, set up and they're scheduled, they can move on to the next stage of planning this event, which is the marketing campaign.

- Once that's all done, you'll need to contact the caterer to arrange for the snacks.

# 2.venue [n.场地]
> so a venue is just a place where an event happens.and a venue can be small, can be big, can be a sports stadium.Or a tiny little restaurant. It's just like a place where an event happens.But we wouldn't say that for, like meeting our friends, like, "where is our venue for meeting this Saturday".

# 3.keynote speakers/speech/address
> 1)so conferences, seminars, even some big types of meetings, not all meetings, they will often have keynote speakers. And a keynote speaker, in this case, is the most important speaker, the most important person.

> 2)So the keynote is the most important part of anything. It could be a keynote speaker, in this case, could also be a keynote speech,or a keynote address.

# 4.shortlist [n.候选名单] & put out [phr.发布、张贴、给、发表]
> 1）So a shortlist might have like, three or four people maybe.And then from that shortlist you have to choose. It's easier to choose from say four people rather than fourteen people.

> 2)So this verb "put out", it's when you do something, you put it out there for others to see it.And when you are finding employees or staff for any kind of event, or any kind of workplace really, you usually put out an ad.you are actually putting something that you want people to find, you want them to see.

> 3)We should say that this phrase verb "put out" literally has a dozen meanings in English. in some cases, "take". Like for example, my grandmother always put out seeds for the birds.you want the birds to eat the seeds.or you put out some milk for the cat,or you put out some cookies for Santa Claus.

> 4)we could also, let's say after the event is finished, we could also put out a report about the event.or put out a newsletter even.

# 5.marketing campaign [n.营销活动] 
> 1)The marketing campaign. Okay, so marketing is,it's letting people know what's going on. you can't plan an event and just hope people will come.You need to hire some famous band to sing a song about your event.get a model to talk about your event. Or celebrity.These can all be things that happen inside a campaign.

> 2)a campaign, which is just a series of activities, planned activities, and you're trying to achieve your goal and your goal, in this case, is to have lots of people come to your seminar.

> 3)so when we use this word "campaign" in other contexts, well like an army or military campaign.Or I'm thinking about like Roman history. Caesar, his campaign. Go kill this guy and then kill that guy, and come back to Rome and kill all the guys.

> 4)If you want to be the president or even the mayor /'meɚ/ [n.市长], you need to run a campaign.
