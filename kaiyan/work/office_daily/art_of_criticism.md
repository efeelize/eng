# I.How to disagree at work
> Here is our pick of the top eight ways to handle a disagreement in the workplace:

- 1. Pick your battles wisely. If you disagree about everything, your coworkers will see you as argumentative /ˌɑrɡju'mɛntətɪv/ [adj.好辩的] and disagreeable[生性好争斗，不好相处].

- 2. Don’t hold a conflict when you’re angry, emotional, or upset.

- 3. Disagreement should not be personal. Do not disagree with your coworker because there is something wrong with her or you don’t like her.

- 4. Maintain your professionalism. Be respectful of your coworkers.

- 5. Understand what your coworker needs, fears, and hopes to obtain from the solution.

- 6. Focus your discussion on shared interests[共同利益] and desired outcomes [双方都想达成的结果上].

- 7. Listen to try to see your coworker’s point of view.

- 8. The goal is not to win but to clear the air in any disagreement at work.

# II.The art of constructive criticism
> Most people are very thin-skinned [肤浅] and easily upset [很容易沮丧] when it comes to receiving criticism. Even when criticism is constructively intended, the receiver may be sensitive and respond with feelings of anger, sadness, or guilt.

> Fortunately, there are several excellent methods for giving constructive criticism that are unlikely to trigger bad feelings.

> The first method of constructive criticism is to request a specific change in the future [直接对以后要做出的具体改变提出要求] instead of pointing out something negative in the present.

> Indeed, most would agree that hearing "In the future, please remember to put your dishes in the dishwasher instead of leaving them in the sink [水槽]" is far preferable to "You have to stop leaving your dirty dishes in the sink!"

> Another technique of constructive criticism is called the "sandwich method" [三明治模式] in which one sandwiches the meat of a criticism between two positive comments.[将批评这块“肉”放在积极评价的两片“面包”中间]

> Hence, instead of saying "You did a lousy job writing this report,[其糟糕]" using the sandwich method one could say "You did a great job on the introduction, but the middle section and conclusion seem a little weak. With a bit more work, I'm sure you can tighten it up into a really good report."

# III.grammar
# 1.婉转表达
> In English, we use hedges to be more indirect as a way of being polite. They can be combined together to make something even more polite. It's very useful for formal conversations or dealing with conflict. However, if hedges /hedʒ/ [模糊语] are used too much in casual conversation, the speaker risks seeming insincere.[在非正式对话中使用得太多，讲话人可能会显得不真诚]

- It might be good to stop now before it’s too late.

- That could possibly be a bad idea.

- It seems like you maybe don’t understand what I’m saying.

## 2）might/ I think /a bit of + overstatement [n.夸张] & understatement [n.重事轻说;轻描淡写]
> That means, well, you can imagine like over and statement. It's almost as if you're saying too much.You think too much, you are making something more important, bigger than it really is.Exactly, exactly. So, I don't mean, you are saying too much in terms of how many words you are using, but just the value or the...the weight that you put onto them.

## 3）fully understand where you're comming from & sb is coming from 
> 1)so this is also really important. It's like I understand your perspective.

## 4）to share sentiment [n.情绪、感触]
> sentiment, it's kind of like your... your opinion or idea about something.you could be feeling.sharing a sentiment, of course, is like sharing an idea or feeling or perspective.Or opinion. Yeah, for sure. So, you can say this, it's a fancy polite way to say I disagree.

## 5)I see your point,but...
