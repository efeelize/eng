# I.How to disagree at work
> Here is our pick of the top eight ways to handle a disagreement in the workplace:

- 1. Pick your battles wisely. If you disagree about everything, your coworkers will see you as argumentative /ˌɑrɡju'mɛntətɪv/ [adj.好辩的] and disagreeable[生性好争斗，不好相处].

- 2. Don’t hold a conflict when you’re angry, emotional, or upset.

- 3. Disagreement should not be personal. Do not disagree with your coworker because there is something wrong with her or you don’t like her.

- 4. Maintain your professionalism. Be respectful of your coworkers.

- 5. Understand what your coworker needs, fears, and hopes to obtain from the solution.

- 6. Focus your discussion on shared interests[共同利益] and desired outcomes [双方都想达成的结果上].

- 7. Listen to try to see your coworker’s point of view.

- 8. The goal is not to win but to clear the air in any disagreement at work.

# II.grammar
# 1.婉转表达
> In English, we use hedges to be more indirect as a way of being polite. They can be combined together to make something even more polite. It's very useful for formal conversations or dealing with conflict. However, if hedges /hedʒ/ [模糊语] are used too much in casual conversation, the speaker risks seeming insincere.[在非正式对话中使用得太多，讲话人可能会显得不真诚]

- It might be good to stop now before it’s too late.

- That could possibly be a bad idea.

- It seems like you maybe don’t understand what I’m saying.
