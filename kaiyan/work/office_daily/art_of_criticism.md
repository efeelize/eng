# I.How to disagree at work
> Here is our pick of the top eight ways to handle a disagreement in the workplace:

- 1. Pick your battles wisely. If you disagree about everything, your coworkers will see you as argumentative /ˌɑrɡju'mɛntətɪv/ [adj.好辩的] and disagreeable[生性好争斗，不好相处].

- 2. Don’t hold a conflict when you’re angry, emotional, or upset.

- 3. Disagreement should not be personal. Do not disagree with your coworker because there is something wrong with her or you don’t like her.

- 4. Maintain your professionalism. Be respectful of your coworkers.

- 5. Understand what your coworker needs, fears, and hopes to obtain from the solution.

- 6. Focus your discussion on shared interests[共同利益] and desired outcomes [双方都想达成的结果上].

- 7. Listen to try to see your coworker’s point of view.

- 8. The goal is not to win but to clear the air in any disagreement at work.

# III.grammar
# 1.婉转表达
> In English, we use hedges to be more indirect as a way of being polite. They can be combined together to make something even more polite. It's very useful for formal conversations or dealing with conflict. However, if hedges /hedʒ/ [模糊语] are used too much in casual conversation, the speaker risks seeming insincere.[在非正式对话中使用得太多，讲话人可能会显得不真诚]

- It might be good to stop now before it’s too late.

- That could possibly be a bad idea.

> 2)Yeah, for sure. I appreciate your criticism, even though I'm crying on the inside.

## 2）might、I think 、a bit of + overstatement [n.夸张] & understatement [n.重事轻说;轻描淡写]
> That means, well, you can imagine like over and statement. It's almost as if you're saying too much.You think too much, you are making something more important, bigger than it really is.Exactly, exactly. So, I don't mean, you are saying too much in terms of how many words you are using, but just the value or the...the weight that you put onto them.

## 3）fully understand where you're comming from & sb is coming from 
> 1)so this is also really important. It's like I understand your perspective.

# 2.for the sake of sb/sth & criticizing sb for the sake of criticizing
> The phrase “for the sake of someone/something” expresses a motive or goal and means “for the benefit of someone” or the “purpose of something.” For instance, if a woman gives up her job for the sake of her children, she is doing so for their benefit. Likewise, if a colleague gives criticism for the sake of improving the product, then the improvement is the purpose.

> However, in today’s dialogue, the manager (Elise) said that she wasn’t trying to “criticize for the sake of criticising.” When the same word is used before and after the phrase, the phrase roughly means “for no other reason beyond this.” Thus, “criticizing someone for the sake of criticizing” means to criticize someone because you want to and not for some greater benefit.

> Note that there are variations in the phrase and that you’ll frequently hear the noun instead of the gerund [动名词]. The meaning is the same, however. So, you’ll hear speakers say “for the sake of criticizing,” “for the sake of criticism,” and “for criticism’s sake.”
