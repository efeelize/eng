# I.How to disagree at work
> Here is our pick of the top eight ways to handle a disagreement in the workplace:

- 1. Pick your battles wisely. If you disagree about everything, your coworkers will see you as argumentative /ˌɑrɡju'mɛntətɪv/ [adj.好辩的] and disagreeable[生性好争斗，不好相处].

- 2. Don’t hold a conflict when you’re angry, emotional, or upset.

- 3. Disagreement should not be personal. Do not disagree with your coworker because there is something wrong with her or you don’t like her.

- 4. Maintain your professionalism. Be respectful of your coworkers.

- 5. Understand what your coworker needs, fears, and hopes to obtain from the solution.

- 6. Focus your discussion on shared interests[共同利益] and desired outcomes [双方都想达成的结果上].

- 7. Listen to try to see your coworker’s point of view.

- 8. The goal is not to win but to clear the air in any disagreement at work.

***Brian, do you have a minute to chat about the project?***

***I’ve been looking at the analytics and it seems like the project is running out of steam. It might be good to consider a new direction.***

***Oh, I didn’t know that’s how you felt. I am aware that it’s been slow going, but I feel it’s important to give it more time.***

***That’s a good point. And, you’ve done a great job putting it together, but frankly, it’s getting difficult to find funding.***

***Thanks, I appreciate you saying that, but as you know, it’s always been hard to find funding.***

***My main concern is that this time it’s different because we don’t have anything to show for our work.***

***I think that might be a bit of an overstatement, or maybe I just see things differently.***

***I fully understand where you are coming from, but I don’t know if management is going to share that sentiment.***

***I think we can at least agree on that.***

***What if we tried coming up with a contingency plan just in case things don’t work out?***

***Okay, I think I can manage that.***

***Hi Mason, do you have a minute to touch base on the current project?***

***Sure, Elise. What do you want to start with?***

***Let's talk about the design. How do you feel about the image and text ratio?***

***I think the balance is good.***

***The visuals you chose are amazing! But it does seem a little text heavy.***

***There's a lot of info that we need to fit in.***

***I see your point. I'm not trying to criticize for the sake of criticizing. I'm just hoping we can be more constructive in order to achieve a better outcome.***

***Understood. I'll try to adjust the design***

***Great. How are you finding the workflow? Any bottlenecks? Can it be more streamlined?***

***Honestly, I feel the objectives aren't clear and we get buried in tasks without assessing them first.***

***That's a very valid point. I need to do a better job at clarifying the objectives for the team.***

***That would be very helpful. Do you have any other concerns?***

***No, that's all. I'm very glad we had this talk. Thanks for your candor. If you need any help, please let me know.***
