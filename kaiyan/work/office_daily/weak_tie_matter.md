# I.why your weak-tie friendships may mean more than you think?
# 1.weak-tie networks boost happiness,knowledge and a sense of belonging
> A person's social world can be categorized as "strong ties" and "weak ties." Encounters with weak ties can be good for our mental wellbeing. For instance, they are a source of novelty, at a time when the days can all feel the same.

# 2.for new information and ideas,weak ties are more important to us than strong ones
> The people whom you spend a lot of time with swim in the same pool of information as you do. We depend on friendly outsiders to bring us news of opportunities from beyond our immediate circles – and so the more of those acquaintances we have, the better. 

# 3.weak-tie friendships help people cope with various difficulties
> In a time of uncertainty, weak-tie friendships provide guidance on how to behave. For instance, by engaging in a wide variety of conversations with weak ties, people can learn about how to cope with the various difficulties of life under lockdown. 

# II.grammar
# 1.sth is on the table
> It means sth "is available to take or use."Perhaps it could be a job offer that is on the table. Perhaps it's a good offer. Perhaps it's a bad one. We can

this valuable thing.

# III.pattern
***Jim, you strike me as a guy who's always in the know. Where do you get your information?***

***Well I depend a lot on my network of weak ties, which is a fancy way of saying my "acquaintances."***

***That sounds exhausting. I'm spent just making sure my friends and family are happy.***

***It's not always easy, but when we limit our networks to only our strong ties, we're leaving a lot of potential value on the table.***

***I guess there is a lot of information overlap among my friends and family since we all travel in the same circles.***

***Right, if your network is too closely knit, you could be depriving yourself of valuable information coming from peripheral networks.***

***Like job opportunities or a potential career change, right? So any tips on how I can develop more weak ties?***

***Well, I found that joining business groups and attending conferences really helped me to tap into other network hubs.***

***I suppose if anything, it's a good way to broaden my horizons.***
