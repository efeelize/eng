# I.4 secrets to getting a better performance evaluation
# 1. Let your manager know that you're looking forward to your evaluation.
> One reason managers worry about evaluations is that they assume they're nerve-wracking /'nɝv,rækɪŋ/ [烦恼]for employees. If you make it clear that you're looking forward to feedback, you immediately make the process more pleasant.

# 2. Evaluate yourself first. 
> List out how much progress you've made toward your goals and what you'd like to do better in the coming year. If you provide this to your manager, there's a good chance that he/she will pull directly from it when she writes her own.[会很可能从中直接引用内容]

# 3. Keep an evaluation file throughout the year. [全年都要记录好评估档案]
> Keep a file where you jot down /dʒɒt/ /daʊn/ [记录] notes on project successes during the year, so that it's helpful when you're reflecting on your performance during evaluation time. 

# 4.Ask colleagues to give feedback to your manager. 
> Think of who particularly appreciates the work you do and tell them you'd be grateful if they'd provide input to your manager. [向领导提供关于你绩效的反馈]

# II.End of year bonuses in America
> About 80% of American companies hand out bonuses [发奖金] at the end of the year to show their appreciation for employees' hard work, but how are they calculated?

> Some bosses give a fixed bonus across the board[倾向于所有人奖金都一样], which most experts advise against[不建议], as it reinforces the idea that just showing up will grant you extra money at the year's end[实际上只是在年底给所有人都多发一笔钱]. A performance-based system is usually recommended, and this will depend on how well both the company and the individual did. Usually calculated as a percentage of your base salary, it also means that the higher your salary, the more you get.

> There are those who argue against monetary incentives[金钱激励], citing studies that show financial rewards[激励方式] are not a good motivator /'məutiveitə/ for good performance[很好的改善绩效]. It could also create jealousy among employees with huge salary disparities /dɪ'spærəti/ [n.悬殊]. For example, a 30% bonus for an entry-level employee [职场新人] would only be a fraction of the bonus that a higher salaried coworker gets. [可能只有他们薪水更高的同事的一小部分]

> However, companies are beginning to realize just how important it is to retain top talent[留住顶尖人才]. Bonuses put the focus on performance[奖金关注于绩效], and allow companies to reward their most valuable employees while keeping them from having to commit to a higher base salary[防止他们要求高底薪], which is harder to maintain when the economy or the company doesn't do well[这样当经济或公司不景气的时候，公司压力会很大]. In fact, many argue that companies shouldn't only offer a lump /lʌmp/ [一块] year-end bonus [年底的时候发一次奖金] and instead implement year-round recognition through mid-year bonuses [半年奖金] as well as spot rewards for milestones /'maɪlston/  achieved [重大成就奖金] throughout the year. It makes people feel appreciated, and immediate feedback reinforces /ˌriɪn'fɔrs/ [vt.增强;加强] hard work, as well as an organization's vision[组织意识]. In turn, it increases loyalty and motivation, leading to higher employee satisfaction.

> Many Silicon Valley companies offer a minimal 15% annual salary as an end of year bonus tied to performance evaluation[和绩效挂钩]. Many also offer a sign-on bonus [签约奖金] equivalent to one month's salary [额外一个月的薪水] in order to attract top talent.[以此吸引人才]

# III.Year-end bonus in the U.S.
> A year-end bonus (sometimes called a "Christmas bonus") is a reward paid to an employee at the end of the year. Many year-end bonuses are tied to performance metrics[绩效权值挂钩], and the amount can vary depending on whether certain milestones are met[实现了某些目标]. Year-end bonuses are usually made up of lump-sum payments [一次性全部支付] used to reward the individual for hard work and dedication.

> On Wall Street, it is common to see top executives [高级管理层] and employees of financial firms receive large bonuses at the end of the year. Bonuses fluctuate depending on the economy and the year's performance, but in most years the amount is substantial[有所波动].

> A year-end bonus can be offered by any size company[任何规模的公司都可能发年终奖], typically when the overall sales and profit goals for the year have been met or exceeded[达到或者超过总体销售目标和利润目标时发]. The company may aim to offer year-end bonuses on a regular basis[定期发], or only offer them after an exceptional performance[只有员工表现出色才发]. These bonuses may be structured based on the employee’s salary[基于员工的薪资来评定], how well they met personal goals such as achieving sales targets, or other measures. In many examples, the year-end bonus is a taxable [需要纳税] increase in salary, which means the actual take-home [实际收到的钱] pay may not be as large as anticipated.

# IV.grammar
# 1.In a position to do something
>  In a position basically means what we, what did we say, we said ability, have the ability to do something or the authority. Right, so you know, I'm not really in a position to help, I want to help you, I'm not really in a position to help.When you aren't in a position to do something, you are either unable to do it or don't have the authority to.

- 1. I really wish I could help, but I'm not in a position to work on marketing campaigns.[没有资格处理市场活动这块的工作]

# 2.evaluation [n.评价] & performance evaluation [n.绩效考核] & performance-based [adj.基于绩效的] & non-performance-based [adj.不基于绩效的]
> 1)so an evaluation is just a review. It's looking back at someone's work over the year. So they take kind of information like, how much overtime [n.加班时间] they did, how much money they earn for the company, and then they use that as their evaluation to determine whether they'll get a promotion or a bonus.

> 2)we can evaluate other things besides employees, right? Maybe you don't know what school you're gonna go to, so you say, "I need to evaluate my options."

> 3) so based on performance or bonuses that are based on performance, that can be shortened into performance-based bonuses.

> 4) so that's where she says, she says there is a non-performance-based bonus, that's the Chinese New Year bonus, but there's also another one, a performance-based one as well.

# 3.bonus /'bonəs/ [pl.bonuses] & perks [n.福利，非现金形式发放] & year-end bonuses [n.年终奖] & big fat [adj.丰厚的]
> 1) So, "a bonus" is just money that you usually get at the end of the year, and it's money added to your salary. So, it's kind of like extra salary.

> 3) So this is a, like a colloquial, very spoken English way of saying benefits.So these include like your health care, it could include vacation, other things like that. It's something good, something people want, advantage. But it's not related to money.So for example, a perk might be free lunch or like a paid gym membership.Perks. 

> 4) we called it end of year bonuses, but we often just say year-end bonuses.

> 5) usually when we use big fat, we are talking about money and we're talking about money in a very positive sense.like you could say while, he has a big fat salary.I got a big fat tax refund from government, not true, I'm waiting for this big fat check.

# 4.put in sth & put sth in  [phr.投入]
> 1)That's to kinda spend some extra time or effort to do something.it's usually time and effort. You put in time. You put in effort and then the result is well, in this case, it was a bonus, but it could be other good things too.

> 2)sometimes when we use "put in," we separate this phrasal verb as well.Yeah, this one you can separate, so you can "put time in" or "put in time." It's fine.

# 5.bring in [v.带来、引入]
> we often talk about bringing in sales, bringing in revenue. There is lots of things that you can bring in that a company or a boss would find super valuable.So Kate must've gone out, found some new customers and attracted them to the company.

> 3)it's a bit more abstract but you can say that someone or something to the core.Or it could be a thing like, you know, he is a politician to the core.

- The pear is rotten to the core.[这梨全烂了。]

- And that shakes me to the core.[而这一点动摇了我的内心。]

> 4) OK, non-core is non-important, unimportant roles. That's not true. These are support roles and you know they're often just as—if not more—important to the structure.

# 7.proactive /ˌpro'æktɪv/  [adj.积极主动地] & reactive /rɪ'æktɪv/ & driven [adj.有动力的] 
> 1)It's good to be proactive, and basically, if you're proactive, you make things happen. You don't wait for something to happen, and then you do something. You're kind of like ahead of everything,?when you're being proactive, yeah, you're... you're out there. You're not waiting for anybody. You're getting stuff done.

> 1)"draw up," we almost always use it with contracts or other legal documents.It could even be like plans, "to draw up some plans."Oh, that's true. Yeah, so if you are an architect, your job is to design structures. You can draw up a plan. A lawyer can draw up an agreement.

> 2)do remember ,it is always draw up.

> 3) it is kind of like a plan or set up,or a system.when we use this word as a verb, it almost always means do something bad. They're scheming. But scheme can just be like, it just, yeah, a plan, a system, a marketing scheme. And you know, an employment scheme. Something like that.

# 10.formalize [v.正式化] & -ize

You need to make rules, formal rules.So this always comes with scaling up as well, you know, when you're a scrappy little startup, you know, you can really do kind of whatever you want, but when you get to be, youknow, a big company everything needs to be formalized.

> 2)the suffix /'sʌfɪks/ [后缀] -IZE usually just means to make or become. So you can finalize things, to make something final. You can prioritize things, you can make it a priority.

# 11.retainers [n.保持器]

> On the fence basically just means there are two choices, may be more than two, there are probably two choices and in between those two choices is a fense.Or a line, exactly, and you are just, maybe this one, maybe this one, maybe this one.So you're just sitting on the fence means you, you, either you can't choose or you won't choose.you're not sure.

# 13.jealousy [n.嫉妒] & envy [n. 羡慕；嫉妒]
> 1)So we often say that maybe jealousy is, that's the bad one.it's more negative. jealousy is afraid that someone's going to take what is yours. So if we take a relationship here for example, if you are jealous of someone and you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, you are afraid that person is going to take your person.

> 2)envy is more like wanting what someone else has.envy is just like,"Oh, Diana you know you're going on vacation again, oh..." or, you know, or like maybe "your apartment is so beautiful, you know, I really envy you".Now if you are envious of someone else's boyfriend or girlfriend, you just admire the qualities perhaps that their boyfriend or girlfriend has.

> 4)incentive:it's usually, you know, some money or something valuable.

# 15.tiered /tɪə/ [adj.阶梯式的、分层的] & tier one city [n.一线城市]
> 1)So this tiered means multilevel.So always refers to level. It doesn't matter if, if we use it as a noun, as in tier or in, as an adjective

> 2)So we say tier one, we also say first tier, right? But you still get that, that same idea of level, right, I mean, the cities at the top. The cities that are kind of going down.When I think of a tiered system, I think one of the first things I think of is the military.Because there are just so many different ranks and tiers and it takes a long time to climb all the way up to the top.

> 3)And if you are at a big company, there might be multiple tiers of management.So we all know the CEO sits at the top, and then below the CEO might be a couple of directors, and then underneath each director might be some supervising managers and then under the manager's might be some team leads.

# 16.If that
> 1)this is a really good phrase. You could change this by saying no more than, at most, if you kind of make it longer you could say if it even gets that.but of course no one is going to spend that much time or energy to speak in such long sentences.The phrase "if that" is often used after numbers to mean "at the very most" [至多] or "no more than"[不超过]. like if someone asks me "How much were your shoes?", I could say I don't remember, like fifty, if that?

> 2)However,"if that" also implies "but probably not"[可能不会]. So in today's dialogue, when we heard that a quarter of [1/4] the American workforce receives a bonus, the speaker was actually skeptical that the number is that high.

> 3)There are lots of situations in which you can use this phrase. One very common one would be where a speaker is trying to emphasize that something won't take very long. Another could be a conversation where a speaker is disagreeing with another person's estimate of something.[说话人不赞同另一个人所强调的事情]

- 1. We don't have a lot on the agenda today, so the meeting should take about an hour, if that. [我们今天的议程没有太多，所以本次会议只要一个小时左右，可能还不到。] 

- 2. You couldn't sell your car for $2000! You'd be lucky to get $1000, if that. [你的车2000美元卖不出去的！你卖到1000美元就算幸运了，可能还不到。]

- 3. It won't take long to drive there. Two hours, if that. [开车去那儿要不了多久。就两个小时，可能还不到。]

# 17.hyphenated /'haɪfən,etɪd/ [adj.带有连字符号的] & company-dependent [adj.取决于公司的]
> 1)if you said based on performance, you could change that to performance-based.that becomes an adjective, that just makes it sound more natural and flow, a little bit better. and we often use this hyphen based, kind of grammar structure, like you could say evidence based,or even you know, market based.

> 2)So this is, you know, depends on the company, which company you work for.Now of course the biggest difference here is that this is coming after the verb is, right? So a lot of people would say:"Oh wait a second, why are you hyphenating this? There's no noun.", right? But again you know, there are no hard fast rules for hyphenating things, for putting a hyphen in word.

# 18.industry [n.行业] & industrial /ɪn'dʌstrɪəl/ [adj.工业的] & industrious /ɪn'dʌstrɪəs/ [adj. 勤劳的] & high-octane /'ɑkten/ [adj.干净十足] & laid-back [adj.闲散的]
> 1)Now of course the bonus is going to depend on where you work and often where you work doesn't necessarily mean where your office is, but actually which industry you belong to.like that could be the tech industry, it could be the medical industry.Or the banking industry. 

> 2)Yeah I mean industry originally meant factories, there really aren't a ton of factories in America anymore.that's why we get that word industrial.

> 3)of course the American spirit is also very industrious.

> 4)so high-octane, this makes me think of race cars.because they use high-octane gasoline.and in this case it just means high energy.a back high- octane sports, even is another example of high-octane, I don't know, coffee? I guess a lot of coffee would have more caffeine in it, and I would not be surprised if a company like Starbucks would say try our new high-octane coffee.

> 5)laid-back is like the opposite of high-octane.

# 19.sweet deal [phr.很棒啊] & two for the price of one [phr.买一送一]
> 1）sweet deal. it's when you get something nice, you're happy about getting something. I mean a lot of times too this could be used in like a negotiation setting, like they're offering you a deal and maybe it's just not quite good enough, so I need to find a way to sweeten the deal.

> 2)it sounds like a sales slogan or something.Two for one deal.

# 20.managerial /ˌmænə'dʒɪrɪəl/ [adj.管理上的]
> just anything to do with manager stuff, so I mean you can think about this word collocating with words like duty, managerial responsibilities. Tasks, managerial style I think is probably one of the most important ones, what is your style of management?

# 21.extravagant /ɪk'strævəgənt/ [adj.奢华]
> 1)Extravagant would mean like you're kind of spending too much on something.It's a little bit too much. So some time you really want to emphasiz that something like looks really nice and flashy, but it's a bit too much.

> 2)When we talk about extravagant fashion, it's a kind of fashion that's really really out there, right?Maybe a little bit too much, or there's a very famous book, many of you have read or seen the movie of, which is called the Great Gatsby, and Gatsby would throw these extravagant party.he lived extravagantly.

# 22.to say the least [phr.不夸张的说]
> it's usually used kind of in a negative way? Like it's more than what I say.that's kind of funny because earlier we have, just that little chunk, if that, right? So like this is kind of the opposite before we were emphasizing that something is kind of small and here we're emphasizing "Wow this is pretty big."so I could say like the food was disappointing to say the least.

# 23.publicize [v.公开宣传]
> So when you publicize something, you kind of share it, you announce it to the public.you know it often has positive connotations /ˌkɑnə'teʃən/ [n.内涵] and can have negative connotations as well.

# 24.stick around [phr.等着] & jump ship [phr.跳槽]
> 1）sticking around of course means not leaving.you're kind of waiting around for some, so these guys who stick around for their bonuses right after that happens they apparently just jump ship.

> 2)We should say you guys probably do know by now that we do not have a phrase in English that's like jump a job.No no, it's always jump ship.And it's usually when something bad starts to happen and you're like: Uh-oh, the company's going down, better jump ship.

- 1. Would you mind sticking around until after lunch? We can do the second interview then. 

- 2. It was a really great reception, but we really didn't stick around all that late. 

- 3. Being in a lasting relationship means sticking around through thick and thin. [要持久维持一段关系意味着要同甘共苦。]

# 25.savvy /'sævi/ [n.悟性] & savvier
> 1)so savvy just means you have this like ability, the kind of practical ability to do something.so we do often use it in these lessons, also hyphenated,text-savvy, street-savvy.

> 2)but here we could almost think of it as it chunk, someone has gotten savvier. It's like they've learned.they've gotten better, more skillful.

- 1. The kid is tech savvy[技术行家], sir, but fret not, I am tech savvier.[技术行行家]

- 2. You're so savvy about pop culture[对大众文化的悟性特别好].I really am.

- 3. Trump is a very savvy [精明] political animal.

- 4. These savvy speakers [演讲老手] have some tips for novice speakers.[新手]

# V.pattern 
***Hi Kate, thanks for coming in. Let's talk about your annual performance evaluation and bonus.***

***Let's start with your work. You not only put in the most overtime, but also brought in many new customers.***

***It's been a busy year. I noticed we needed extra help, so I decided to step up.***

***Thank you for being so proactive. It's been key to our success.***

***My pleasure. I'm always happy to take on more responsibility.***

***Good to hear. To show my gratitude, I've decided to give you a Chinese New Year bonus.***

***Wow, that's so generous of you! I really appreciate it.***


# VI.pattern
***Zack, do you have some time to discuss the end of year bonuses?***

***That's right. We weren't really in a position to do it before. But with the help of new funding as we scale up, we need to formalize rewards and bonuses to help us retain and attract talent.***

***Absolutely. So is this something you'd like to have for people across the board or just key staff?***

***Well, I'm still on the fence. What do you think?***

***People are going to talk. We don't want to be in a situation where bonuses create jealousy.***

***I see where you're coming from. At the same time, we also want to reward top performers and incentivize others to up their game.***

***Correct. That's why I'd suggest using a tiered system. Of course, it should all be performance-based.***

***Well, we don't have performance evaluations for all the staff yet as we've just started to build a proper HR system.***

***That's alright. What we can do is formalize a bonus scheme for core roles and tie it to their performance. For roles that are non-core, it's up to you whether you want to give bonuses or just perks instead.***

***Ok, I'll think about it. How much of a bonus should we give?***

***I'd suggest starting with one month's salary for top performers since this is the first year we're doing bonuses. We can always go up in the future.***

# VII.pattern
***Hey, Clark, can I ask you a question? Do Americans get year-end bonuses?***

***Some do, but most don't. Depends on the industry[公司].***

***Really? In China, most companies give out Chinese New Year bonuses.***

***That's a sweet deal[那很棒啊]! I'd say that at most[往多了说], a quarter of the American workforce gets a bonus, if that[可能还不到这么多].***

***You mean people don't even get performance-based bonuses?***

***Well, bankers and the high-octane [干劲十足] salespeople get big fat ones, for sure. A lot of people in managerial positions also do. Is your bonus performance-based?***

***It's company-dependent[取决于公司]. But many give a non-performance-based CNY bonus and there's a performance- based one as well.***

***Wow, two for the price of one! How big is the CNY bonus usually?***

***It ranges from gift cards, a few hundred RMB, a month's pay, to a Tesla!***

***A Tesla? That's extravagant to say the least![不夸张地说这也太奢侈了吧]***

***Well, that's the extreme case[极端个例]. But many people brag about their companies' Chinese New Year perks. In turn, many companies also publicize their own benefits and perks for the PR opportunity.[争取公关机会]***

***Oh I see. Does it create management problems though when the CNY bonuses are more for showing up than for performance[嘉奖表现]?***

***It certainly does. For example, many people just stick around in order to get their CNY bonuses. Right after the New Year, they jump ship[跳槽].***

***Oh no! But I bet companies have gotten savvier /'sævi/ at dealing with those situations.[应对这些情况肯定越来越精明]***

***Yeah, I think so. For example, the company I work for just gives out a smaller CNY bonus, and most of those bonuses are performance-tied.***

***I see. Well, at the end of the day[不管怎么说], it's great that most people get a bonus to celebrate the New Year.***
