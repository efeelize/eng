## 1)self-induced [adj.自我诱发的，自己导致的] 
> induce just means to cause sth to happen,so if sth is "self-induced" that means you cause sth to happen to yourself.and when we're talking about anxiety,it's very common for perfectionists to experience self-induced anxiety,they give themselves a lot of stress and a lot of worry.

## 2)takes a toll [phr.带来负面影响；造成损失]
> it means it harms us,like a high-stress job can really take a toll on your mental health,or maybe even your physical health，or we can say that it takes a toll on our emotions.

## 4)inadequacy /ɪˈnædəkwəsi/ [n.信心不足] & to feel inadequate
> to feel inadequate just means you feel like you're not good enough,maybe you're not smart enough or funny enough.But if we're talking about work,it's likely that you might feel that your knowledge isn't good enough to do your job,so you might feel that your knowledge is inadequate.

## 5)maxed out  [phr.精疲力竭；做到极限] 
> 1)it is a good phrase to talk about sb who's just burnt out.so if you've been working a lot of overtime or maybe you've just been really stressed out,then you'll probably feel maxed out.

# III.pattern
***Hey, Roger. You work in a fast-paced industry, have you ever experienced work anxiety?***

***Sure have, Steven. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I used to get frustrated when I felt I wasn't meeting my standards.***

***I know how that feels. Mind you, my anxiety is largely self-induced, but it still takes a toll.***

***Absolutely. I'm also surrounded by high-achieving co-workers. But the biggest culprits were the lack of support and feelings of inadequacy.***

***Sounds like you were pretty maxed out. What did you do?***

***I stopped stewing and focused on expanding my knowledge. I attended seminars and read industry-related books which helped me build self-assurance.***

***They do say knowledge is the cure for anxiety, but I'm not sure it's enough.***

***It isn't, which is why support networks are vital to help you stay grounded and get you out of that rut.***

***True. Without support, it's easy to lapse back into that anxiety-inducing mindset and let your worries fester.***
