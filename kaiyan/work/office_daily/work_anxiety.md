# work_anxiety
# I.things to remember when you're dealing with work anxiety
# 1.your employer won't fire you
> A major part of having an anxiety attack in the workplace can be the fear that you'll get fired. The good news is you probably won't. The fear of getting sacked is often part of the catastrophizing defensive mechanism that is a hallmark of workplace anxiety. But should your worst "what if" scenario come true, the law is on your side.

# 2.makes stress your friend
> It's not so much the stress itself that is harmful, as the way in which we think about it. Instead of seeing stress as your enemy, you can make it work for you. Stress and anxiety are nothing but a sign that you care about something, and this care can be molded into something that wildly improves your performance instead of inhibiting it.

# 3.accept your imperfections
> Often, those of us who live with anxiety are also perfectionists and generally people who expect a lot from themselves. When you have anxiety, that makes things even worse, because not being at your best makes you angry at yourself. It's worth remembering that no one is ever perfect, and we all need to take care of and nurture our flawed selves.

# II.grammar
# 1.mind you 
> it is a phrase that we used to show that sb should pay attention to what we're going to say.

# 2.fast-paced industries
> fast-paced industries are like technology or finance.

# 3.bad
## 1)self-induced [adj.自我诱发的，自己导致的] 
> induce just means to cause sth to happen,so if sth is "self-induced" that means you cause sth to happen to yourself.and when we're talking about anxiety,it's very common for perfectionists to experience self-induced anxiety,they give themselves a lot of stress and a lot of worry.

## 2)takes a toll [phr.带来负面影响；造成损失]
> it means it harms us,like a high-stress job can really take a toll on your mental health,or maybe even your physical health，or we can say that it takes a toll on our emotions.

## 3)to lapse back into sth [phr.陷入（消极的状态）] & relapse [v.复发]
> to lapse back into sth means to go back into a bad habit.

## 4)inadequacy /ɪˈnædəkwəsi/ [n.信心不足] & to feel inadequate
> to feel inadequate just means you feel like you're not good enough,maybe you're not smart enough or funny enough.But if we're talking about work,it's likely that you might feel that your knowledge isn't good enough to do your job,so you might feel that your knowledge is inadequate.

## 5)maxed out  [phr.精疲力竭；做到极限] 
> 1)it is a good phrase to talk about sb who's just burnt out.so if you've been working a lot of overtime or maybe you've just been really stressed out,then you'll probably feel maxed out.

## 6）to stew /ˈstjuːɪŋ/ [phr.为... 困扰或生气] & stew over sth & stew in sth
> 1)to stew means to constantly think or worry about sth,and often it can keep you up late at night.

> 2)people can stew over anything,they can stew mistakes.they might stew over whether or not to raise a problem with their boss.

> 3)we can also say we just stew in our own thoughts,and that just means we kind of go in circle and circles,thinking about the same thing again and again.

# 4.good
## 1)self-assurance [n.自信]
> so self-assurance,that's just confidence in your abilities,confidence in your skills,particularly at work.so self-assurance is more specific than the word "confidence."

## 2)stay grounded [phr.脚踏实地；保持理智清醒]
> this word is a bit of a buzzword that you hear a lot these days and it just means to stay clam and sort of connected to what's going on in your life and not get carried away with your thoughts.

## 3）support networks
> so it can be almost anybody that's gonna help us,family,friends,colleagues,counselors,therapists.

# 5.culprits /ˈkʌlprɪts/ [n.问题的起因]
> it is the cause of a problem.

# III.pattern
***Hey, Roger. You work in a fast-paced industry, have you ever experienced work anxiety?***

***Sure have, Steven. I'm a bit of a perfectionist, so I used to get frustrated when I felt I wasn't meeting my standards.***

***I know how that feels. Mind you, my anxiety is largely self-induced, but it still takes a toll.***

***Absolutely. I'm also surrounded by high-achieving co-workers. But the biggest culprits were the lack of support and feelings of inadequacy.***

***Sounds like you were pretty maxed out. What did you do?***

***I stopped stewing and focused on expanding my knowledge. I attended seminars and read industry-related books which helped me build self-assurance.***

***They do say knowledge is the cure for anxiety, but I'm not sure it's enough.***

***It isn't, which is why support networks are vital to help you stay grounded and get you out of that rut.***

***True. Without support, it's easy to lapse back into that anxiety-inducing mindset and let your worries fester.***
