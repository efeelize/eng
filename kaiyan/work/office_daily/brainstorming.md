# Brainstorming
# I.six guidelines on how to carry out an effective brainstorming session

# 1.explicitly [adv.明确的] define the topic you’re brainstorming
> Ensure everyone has a clear understanding of the purpose of the session. You can even send out an email with the topic you’ll be brainstorming and ask everyone to prepare some ideas in advance.

# 2.ensure that everyone has a “creative” mindset. 
> Find a room that exhibits those qualities[具备这些条件]. Schedule the brainstorming session in a brightly colored room, or open a window to give people something to look at and feel inspired. Also, schedule the brainstorming session after a break. People need time to rest their minds, step outside and have some fresh air.

# 3. set limits for the brainstorming session. 
> The ideal size of a brainstorming group is five to seven people. It’s small enough for you, as the facilitator /fə'siliteitə/ [n.组织者], to write down all the ideas, but it's still big enough to have plenty of energy in the room. Also, set a proper time limit. Twenty minutes is enough time to get some creative ideas going. Anything after that can slow down the momentum /mo'mɛntəm/ [n.动力] of the group.

# 4. lay out some ground rules. 
> First, outline the goals of this session. For example, the goal is to generate as many ideas as possible. Second, there are no bad ideas, so if you have one, share it. Lastly, don’t criticize ideas at the beginning. Have some time at the end of the session to evaluate ideas.

# 5. make notes that everyone can see. 
> Every idea that is shared should be written down and viewed by everyone. Write the ideas on a white board, so everyone can see them. Make sure to write down exactly what the person said. Don’t rephrase it in a way that makes more sense to you[不要为了让自己看得懂而重新措辞。].

# 6. motivate people to participate by giving positive feedback. 
> Encourage participation by saying phrases like, “thank you, great idea, wow, good work, I like that…” Remember that as the facilitator you should engage with the group and make eye contact with everyone.

# 3.facilitator /fə'siliteitə/ [n.促进者] & get sth going
