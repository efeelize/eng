# Minimum wage
# I.minimum wage in American
> In recent years across much of North America, there has been a big push from thousands of workers to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour. The movement, now dubbed the “Fight for $15 Movement”, was initially intended for McDonald’s employees, but quickly spread to support a significant pay increase for practically all low-wage workers across many industries. With cities like Seattle, New York City and Washington, D.C. vowing to increase their respective minimum wages to $15 an hour, it is evident that the social movement has not gone unnoticed. Nevertheless, much debate about the economic outcome of the proposed pay increase remains.

# III.pattern
***How's business, Frank?***

***It's pretty steady. My wife and I are still crunching a few salary numbers though.***

***Oh right, the minimum wage increase goes into effect soon, right?***

***Yes, so we're weighing our options. We're doing everything we can to avoid letting anyone go.***

***That must be tough. If you don't mind me asking, do you pay all of your staff minimum wage?***

***No that's alright. We pay a competitive wage, but part of what makes it attractive to our staff is the benefits package. Unfortunately, that's where we might have to cut.***

***I'm guessing bookstores like yours don't have the biggest margins.***

***They're razor-thin. But we're trying not to pass any cost increases onto the customers.***

***Honestly, I've always considered myself a progressive, but I'm not sure how I feel about all of this Fight for 15 stuff. Maybe it's not a hill to die on.***

***These top-down approaches rarely solve anything, and this is going to eliminate job opportunities for those who need them the most.***

***I guess I've always thought that if you can't afford to pay people a living wage, you shouldn't be in business.***

***That's certainly the way the debate gets framed these days.***

***But I suppose it isn't fair to paint all business owners with the same brush.***

***So you finally believe I'm not some evil money-grubbing fat cat?***

***I've never said you're evil.***
