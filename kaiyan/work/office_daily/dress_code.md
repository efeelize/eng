# I.Silicon Valley Dress Code vs. East Coast Dress Code
> So, what does it mean to dress “Valley formal[硅谷正装]”?Whenever you hear the term “Valley formal”, that certainly includes a jacket (as in blazer  /'blezɚ/ [休闲西服] or sports coat[运动外套]).So basically, think of it as this way, Valley formal, typically means do not wear a tie; dress up but in a more chilled out fashion[穿着得体但是不会太正式].These are the following articles of clothing you would need to combine to fit[常包含的单品] the valley formal code:

- Casual Blazer (cotton or cotton blended with wool[棉混纺羊毛])
- Jeans or Chinos /ˈtʃino/ [斜纹布裤]
- A Polo shirt, a Button Down shirt[系扣衬衫], or a Round Neck Henley[圆领T恤], Sweater
- And some nice comfy /'kʌmfi/ [adj. 舒服的,轻松的] shoes

> Now, how does Silicon Valley formal differ from east coast formal?By the way, It’s important to understand that “valley formal” does not represent the entire west coast or pretty much any other part of the world for that matter[或世界其他任何地方的着装风格].Valley formal is used for those in Silicon Valley region composed of San Jose, Palo Alto, Menlo Park up to San Francisco.East coast or down south of California[加利福尼亚州南部], there is only one kind of formal; and that is typically a black tie, a three-piece suit[三件套西装] or a fine two-piece suit[一件精美的两件套西装] with a nice silk tie at the very least[一条漂亮的丝绸领带].As a common culture, in the East Coast, people usually dress formal or semi-formal[半正式] to work and that also a result of the dominant[占主导地位] banking, fashion and glamour /ˈɡlæmɚ/ industry.
