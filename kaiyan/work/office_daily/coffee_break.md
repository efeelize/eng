# Coffee_break
# I.A brief history of the coffee break
> In the early 1900s, factories implemented [实施] eight-hour workdays and designated rest hours[固定休息时间]. During break times, workers would sip /sɪp/ [n.&v.抿;小口喝] the bitter brew /brʊ/ [苦涩的咖啡] to recharge /riˈtʃɑrdʒ/ [提神醒脑] before starting another shift. Soon after, street-side coffee stands[咖啡摊] became common in urban areas, and coffee counters [咖啡店] and machines [咖啡机] popped up [风靡] across the country. 

> However, the residents of Stoughton, Wisconsin aren't convinced[不这么认为]. The tiny town argues that its early immigrant workers didn't just take coffee breaks - they invented them. In 1880, a tobacco warehouse hired local Norwegian /nɔrˈwidʒən/ [adj.挪威人的] women to help with tobacco stripping[撕烟草]. The warehouse was close to their homes, allowing them to periodically /pɪrɪ'ɑdɪkli/ [adv.定期地;偶尔] leave and check on their children, prepare food, and grab a cup of coffee. Today, the town honors this history by hosting an annual Coffee Break Festival.

> In the early 1900s[20世纪初], coffee breaks became an official employee benefit. In 1952, the "coffee break" was officially coined /kɔɪn/ [v.创造] when the Pan-American Coffee Bureau [泛美咖啡局] launched an ad campaign. And a little over a decade later[十几年后], the coffee break finally entered national discourse when the United Auto Workers [全美汽车工人联合会]  and the Big Three (Chrysler, Ford, and GM) [三大汽车公司（克莱斯勒、福特和通用）] negotiated a 12-minute coffee break.

# II.grammar
# 1.I was thinking of doing sth 
> it is a way that you can express your intentions or your plans. You can use it to express what you wanted in the past, but you can also use it to express what you want or plan to do right now.Remember that “I was thinking of” must be followed by a noun or a gerund (VERB-ing).

For example, you could go on a grocery /'ɡrosəri/ [n.杂货业] run if you need to buy some milk or eggs and, or any other kind of basic,Or I stay up pretty late and sometimes I like to go for a snack run.Now all of these things so far have been food or the object of this run, but you can also talk about the place that you are going, like, for example, 7-11, you can go on a 7-11 run.Yeah, or a Starbucks run. But you can't use it for things like other than food. So I can't say I'm going on a shirt run.

> 2) So picking people up that obviously can mean a lot of things. You could actually use your body and use your muscles and pick somebody up.

# 9.cupcakes & muffin [松饼]
> And muffins are a little bit healthier, right? Cause they have blueberries or bananas in them. They have some fruit usually.There is healthy stuff inside of them. But maybe Lisa is right. We can't actually say that they are healthy. However, they are delicious.

# 10 last chance for sth / to do sth
