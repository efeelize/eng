# I.A brief history of the coffee break
> In the early 1900s, factories implemented [实施] eight-hour workdays and designated rest hours[固定休息时间]. During break times, workers would sip /sɪp/ [n.&v.抿;小口喝] the bitter brew /brʊ/ [苦涩的咖啡] to recharge /riˈtʃɑrdʒ/ [提神醒脑] before starting another shift. Soon after, street-side coffee stands[咖啡摊] became common in urban areas, and coffee counters [咖啡店] and machines [咖啡机] popped up [风靡] across the country. 

> However, the residents of Stoughton, Wisconsin aren't convinced[不这么认为]. The tiny town argues that its early immigrant workers didn't just take coffee breaks - they invented them. In 1880, a tobacco warehouse hired local Norwegian /nɔrˈwidʒən/ [adj.挪威人的] women to help with tobacco stripping[撕烟草]. The warehouse was close to their homes, allowing them to periodically /pɪrɪ'ɑdɪkli/ [adv.定期地;偶尔] leave and check on their children, prepare food, and grab a cup of coffee. Today, the town honors this history by hosting an annual Coffee Break Festival.

> In the early 1900s[20世纪初], coffee breaks became an official employee benefit. In 1952, the "coffee break" was officially coined /kɔɪn/ [v.创造] when the Pan-American Coffee Bureau [泛美咖啡局] launched an ad campaign. And a little over a decade later[十几年后], the coffee break finally entered national discourse when the United Auto Workers [全美汽车工人联合会]  and the Big Three (Chrysler, Ford, and GM) [三大汽车公司（克莱斯勒、福特和通用）] negotiated a 12-minute coffee break.
