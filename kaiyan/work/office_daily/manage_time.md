# Manage your time better

# I.Powerful time management tips
# 1. Create a time audit.[记录时间]
> When it comes to time management, the first step you need to take is finding out where your time actually goes. The easiest way to keep track of your time is to download an app to track everything you do for a week. You can then access a report to find out what's stealing your time. 

# 2.plan ahead
> One of the worst things that you can do is wake-up [一觉醒来] without a plan for the day[今天没什么计划]. You should always plan ahead using one of these options;

> The night before. Before you leave work for the day, spend the last 15-minutes organizing your office and composing /kəm'pozɪŋ/ [列出] a list of your most important items for tomorrow.

> First thing in the morning. During your morning routine [例行公事] write down the 3 or 4 most urgent and important matters that need to be addressed [亟待解决] today.

# 3. Follow the 80-20 rule.[二八原则]
> The 80-20 rule suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of the effort put in[80%的结果源自20%的努力]. This is commonly used in sales. When it comes to how you should manage your time this principle can also be applied.[论及时间管理，该原则同样适用] 

> You should start by looking at your schedule or to-do-list every day. For the sake of simplicity [简单起见] try to get down five tasks you need to accomplish. Using the principle you can probably eliminate [删掉] the majority of the items on your list.

***David, how do you find the time to juggle all of these different projects?***

***Is your to-do list overwhelming you again?***

***Yeah, it really is. Work keeps piling up, and there are only so many hours in a day.***

***Well, you need to remember to work smarter, not harder.***

***I've heard that before. But how can I actually put that into practice?***
***For me, planning my day in advance really helps me stay focused and minimize distractions.***

***So you make a plan to squeeze as many tasks as you can into a single day?***

***No, not at all! I just identify what is essential and make that the priority.***

***So, I should devote my mornings to the important stuff?***

***That's up to you. What is most important is that you make a routine and stick to it.***
