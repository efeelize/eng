# Manage your time better

# I.Powerful time management tips
# 1. Create a time audit.[记录时间]
> When it comes to time management, the first step you need to take is finding out where your time actually goes. The easiest way to keep track of your time is to download an app to track everything you do for a week. You can then access a report to find out what's stealing your time. 

# 2.plan ahead
> One of the worst things that you can do is wake-up [一觉醒来] without a plan for the day[今天没什么计划]. You should always plan ahead using one of these options;

> The night before. Before you leave work for the day, spend the last 15-minutes organizing your office and composing /kəm'pozɪŋ/ [列出] a list of your most important items for tomorrow.

> First thing in the morning. During your morning routine [例行公事] write down the 3 or 4 most urgent and important matters that need to be addressed [亟待解决] today.

# 3. Follow the 80-20 rule.[二八原则]
> The 80-20 rule suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of the effort put in[80%的结果源自20%的努力]. This is commonly used in sales. When it comes to how you should manage your time this principle can also be applied.[论及时间管理，该原则同样适用] 

> You should start by looking at your schedule or to-do-list every day. For the sake of simplicity [简单起见] try to get down five tasks you need to accomplish. Using the principle you can probably eliminate [删掉] the majority of the items on your list.

# II.grammar
# 1.what 引导的从句
> 1)“what is most important...”,the noun phrase can be rewritten: The thing that is most important...You can put any verb you want into the "what" clause, not limited to "is."

- 1. What is most important is that we learn to work together as a team.

- 2. What she thinks about my life doesn't bother me.

- 3. What is true is that most people do not like paying taxes.

> 2) you don't actually need to have an "is" next to "what." It could be a different verb.like, what I like about China is the food. but you can see that you can really play around with this pattern, and use it as a subject or an object.

# 2.find the time [phr.抽时间、找时间] & make the time 
> 1)to find the time to do something," and it just means that, well, you look at your schedule, you see an open space and hey, you find the time to do an activity.like "I can't find the time to go to the gym." Or find the time to have a social life for some. If you're working, you know, until 10/11 pm at night, it's difficult!

> 2)when you're "making the time," you're actually actively doing this, so you maybe will cancel an appointment, or you will cancel something else so that you have more time.or maybe in our exercise example, you just wake up earlier.

# 3.juggle /'dʒʌɡl/  [v.兼顾] & juggling sth 
> 1)When we're talking about our daily lives, "juggling" means doing several things at the same time.so maybe you are juggling school and work. A lot of people do that. or you might be juggling your kids, your job and school as well. You're usually successfully doing it. 

> 2) of course, you could say:Oh, I can't juggle all of these things.

# 4.overwhelming [ptcp.使应接不暇，使不知所措] & overwhelm sb [v] & overwhelmed
> 1)So things can be overwhelming. Work can be overwhelming. Life can be overwhelming. And as a result, we often feel overwhelmed.

> 2) we often use this in sports, like, a basketball team could overwhelm their opponents /ə'ponənt/.I hope you don't cause that makes me think about, like, you're attacking them.

> 3)In everyday situations, you might use it at work, or when you're studying, you might feel overwhelmed by the information.

# 5.piling up [ptcp.堆积]
> 1)it's often used in this negative sense.So if it keeps piling up, that just means it keeps increasing. so you have some work to do. Maybe it's very small. It doesn't need to be a very big task, but they just keep adding more and more, and then you get another one and another one. 

> 2)we really had to stretch our imaginations to think of a positive way to use this phrase.like:he's fam mail [粉丝来信] is piling up.

# 6.put that into parctice [phr.付诸于实践]
> To "put it into practice" means to actually do this, to actually practice this idea. there's lots of things that we can put into practice. We can put, for example, our values into practice.Or if we're talking about English, you can put that grammar into practice.That is a very, very practical thing that you can put into practice. So basically, you can put anything into practice. It just means "do it."

# 7.minimize [v.减到最少] & minimal /'mɪnɪməl/  [adj.]
> 1)This means to reduce. so you can minimize stress.  you can "minimize the damage." If you work for a company, something bad happens, you need to minimize the damage in the media.

> 2) the adjective is "minimal" and, for example, someone might put minimal effort in at work.

# 8.distractions [n.使人分心的事] & distract [v.] & distracting [adj.]
> 1)distractions:these are just things that take your attention away.

> 2)distract:So we all know what distracts us at work. It's usually our phone, or maybe our computer, or it could be a distracting co-worker.a really chatty co-worker.

# 9.it is essential that sb do sth.../ be essential to sth [adj] & it is necessary/improtant that...
> 1) "essential" means that it's absolutely necessary.so essential is stronger than important. It's more important than important.For example, mathematics is essential to engineering. you could also say this for a person. This person is essential to our team.

> 2) so that is kind of a set phrase there. It's essential that we do something. It's essential that he stay on our team.

> 3) you could also do this with like important or necessary. It's necessary that... It's important that...

# 10.devote yourself to sb & dedicate 
> 1)when you devote yourself to them, you give your time to this person.In kind of a loving way.Just notice the preposition here, devote my mornings "to" important stuff."devote" is just more emotional. it's almost like dedicate plus emotion. So you might devote yourself to your wife, and that sounds better than to dedicate yourself to your wife.so devotion has more of an emotional sense.

> 2) we're thinking again that husband probably dedicated to his family. he works hard to pay the bills, but maybe he's not really happy about it. when you're talking about work, you could say devote or dedicate. 

# III.pattern
