# I.Powerful time management tips
# 1. Create a time audit.[记录时间]
> When it comes to time management, the first step you need to take is finding out where your time actually goes. The easiest way to keep track of your time is to download an app to track everything you do for a week. You can then access a report to find out what's stealing your time. 

# 2.plan ahead
> One of the worst things that you can do is wake-up [一觉醒来] without a plan for the day[今天没什么计划]. You should always plan ahead using one of these options;

> The night before. Before you leave work for the day, spend the last 15-minutes organizing your office and composing /kəm'pozɪŋ/ [列出] a list of your most important items for tomorrow.

> First thing in the morning. During your morning routine [例行公事] write down the 3 or 4 most urgent and important matters that need to be addressed [亟待解决] today.

# 3. Follow the 80-20 rule.[二八原则]
> The 80-20 rule suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of the effort put in[80%的结果源自20%的努力]. This is commonly used in sales. When it comes to how you should manage your time this principle can also be applied.[论及时间管理，该原则同样适用]
