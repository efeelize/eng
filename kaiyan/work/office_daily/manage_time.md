# Manage your time better
# I.Powerful time management tips
# 1. Create a time audit.[记录时间]
> When it comes to time management, the first step you need to take is finding out where your time actually goes. The easiest way to keep track of your time is to download an app to track everything you do for a week. You can then access a report to find out what's stealing your time. 

# 2.plan ahead
> One of the worst things that you can do is wake-up [一觉醒来] without a plan for the day[今天没什么计划]. You should always plan ahead using one of these options;

> The night before. Before you leave work for the day, spend the last 15-minutes organizing your office and composing /kəm'pozɪŋ/ [列出] a list of your most important items for tomorrow.

> First thing in the morning. During your morning routine [例行公事] write down the 3 or 4 most urgent and important matters that need to be addressed [亟待解决] today.

# 3. Follow the 80-20 rule.[二八原则]
> The 80-20 rule suggests that 80% of results come from 20% of the effort put in[80%的结果源自20%的努力]. This is commonly used in sales. When it comes to how you should manage your time this principle can also be applied.[论及时间管理，该原则同样适用] 

> You should start by looking at your schedule or to-do-list every day. For the sake of simplicity [简单起见] try to get down five tasks you need to accomplish. Using the principle you can probably eliminate [删掉] the majority of the items on your list.

# II.How to deal with impossible deadlines at work
> Nothing creates dread in the workplace like tight deadlines, but when well managed they are rarely as impossible as they might seem.

# 1.Accept that it's got to go [接受瑕疵，及时提交]
> The most effective mindset /'maindset/ [n.心态] is to do the best you can within the time available, but deadlines can only be met by sending what you have when it's due – not by thinking time is going to expand [延长时间] to allow you to always achieve perfection.

# 2.Stay cool under pressure
> It's important not to view deadlines as ticking time bombs. A lot can get done in a short time if you simply stay calm and don’t let stress cloud your thinking. Only worry about things when there is clearly a problem, rather than burning emotional energy on false alarms.

# 3.Flag problems early [有问题及早上报]
> Don't suffer in silence [在沉默中忍受]. If you encounter a problem that risks blowing out the deadline, make it known to your manager. This will give them the chance to take action early, which is much better than keeping quiet until deadline day arrives and the project is incomplete.

# III.What to do when you are behind schedule？
> Depending on the reasons why the project is behind schedule, your options vary. The methods listed here can help you work out a best solution in a multicultural environment. 

# 1.Do overtime or extend the deadline
> When the delay is minor, overtime[加班] is what you need in order to get back on track. If the delay isn't minor and/or overtime is not an option, you could try to extend the deadline, especially when the delay is the result of an unavoidable accident nobody could have predicted[发生众人意料之外的突发状况].

# 2.Change the scope
> If it turns out that a particular task requires much more effort than what you have initially [最初] estimated, or if the task is not as vital as it was originally deemed to be, then you can exclude[剔除] it from the project scope and still make it on time. However, don't forget to get the approval before you make the rescheduling.

# 3.Include more resources
> If the project permits it, you can ask other departments for help or assign more people to the project. But always bear in mind: When new people come into the project, they need to be trained first and get acquainted /ə'kwentɪd/ [adj.了解，知晓] with the project.

# IV.grammar
