# I.Tips for how to handle criticism
> Being sensitive to criticism can be a sticky situation. Sometimes people may even stop working toward a goal out of fear of being critiqued. Here are some helpful tips to handle any kind of criticism that heads our way.

# 1.Listen up
> Figure out whether the criticism is constructive [有益] or simply rude [单纯的无理宣泄]. You may feel hurt when your partner says you're controlling [强势], but having him point out this flaw [指出你的缺点] may help you change and ultimately save the relationship. If criticism could be helpful, lend all ears [洗耳恭听] and try to learn from it instead of getting defensive [心怀戒备].

# 2.Don't take it personally [不要把批评当成私人恩怨]
> Try to remove yourself from the situation and focus on what's being critiqued /krɪ'tik/ [vt.批判]. That C+ midterm [期中考试] doesn't reflect your A+ personality [A+人格]! Instead, it's a reminder to study a little harder next time, skip all that partying the night before, or realize that calculus /'kælkjələs/ [微积分] simply isn't your biggest strength.

# 3.Manage stress [控制压力]
> When we're constantly on edge, we can feel out of control [失控] and unable to respond to criticism with a clear head. So take a deep breath to keep those stress levels in check.

# I.How to evaluate an employee's performance
> Employee performance evaluation is a key factor to inspire your employees, improve the quality of work, and keep them motivated. There are some important points to consider when you evaluate a team member.

# 1.Quality of work
> In the world of web, our most important data point is the quality of work that our employees create.This is measured through regular review of our client deliverables, their role in client efforts, stability of the production changes/platform, best practices, and feedback from the client.

# 2. Level of creativity
> Creativity is one of the most important points in evaluating employee performance.How often did the employee question basic assumptions about a problem and come up with a new solution? Did they think outside of the box and successfully take risks on their own?

# 3.Amount of consistent improvement
> No employee has the capacity to be truly excellent at every evaluation point on our quarterly review form; however, every employee has the opportunity to improve each day, month, quarter, and year.The desire and effort to become better is the most rewardable quality.

# III.What is a 360 review in the workplace?
> The 360 review is a professional feedback opportunity that enables a group of coworkers to provide feedback on an employee’s performance. The feedback is generally asked for by the manager to whom the employee reports.[通常是负责这位员工的上司向大家寻求反馈意见]

> Coworkers who participate in the 360 review usually include the employee's boss, several peers, and functional managers with whom the employee works regularly.

> Hence, the name of the feedback opportunity [反馈的机会] comes from the fact that performance feedback is solicited from all directions in the organization[是因为对工作表现的反馈是来自公司内部各个角度的]. The objective of the feedback is to give the employee the opportunity to understand how their work is viewed in the total organization.[整个组织内部对他们工作的看法是怎样的。]

> The 360 review differs from an employee appraisal [员工评估] which traditionally provides the employee with the opinion of his or her performance as viewed by their manager. These employee appraisals tend to focus on the progress the employee achieved on job goals. The 360 review tends to focus more on how the employee affected the work of other employees than on whether the work was accomplished.

# I.handling a bad performance review rating
> A performance review or appraisal is not the end product of a negotiation between assessor and assessee. A performance appraisal is a formal record of a supervisor’s opinion of the quality of an employee’s work.

> The important word here is opinion. As long as that opinion is based on your manager’s honest assessment of how well you have done the job and is uncolored by personal biases and prejudices, the manager has done the job that is expected of them, and the matter is settled.

> When deciding whether to challenge a low rating, you’ve generally got three choices:1)“My boss may well be right. I’m disappointed, but I’m going to accept this and make whatever changes that are necessary to justify a higher rating next year.”2)“Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead! This rating is wrong, and I’m ready to do whatever it takes to get it changed.”3)“I’m out of here.” 

> When you do get back to your boss, do one of two things.1)Acknowledge that the assessment served as a significant learning experience (or wake-up call), and ask for their help in understanding how you can make a more valuable contribution in the next 12 months. 2)Tell your boss that you have considered the appraisal carefully, and after serious thought you believe that an adjustment of the rating is justified. Produce the evidence and the examples that justify your position, keeping in mind that success — a changed rating — is probably unlikely, regardless of your evidence.

***Hi Ella, could I have a word with you?***

***Of course. What would you like to discuss?***

***Well, it's about your performance. I couldn't help but notice that your reports have been a bit late.***

***Yes. Sorry about that. There was some confusion regarding the new timeline, so it took longer than usual.***

***I see. Well next time, please clarify the deadlines and adjust accordingly.***

***Absolutely. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again.***

***Alright. But to be frank, I've also noticed an increasing amount of errors.***

***Yes. About that... the workload has been a little heavy this month, but I'll make sure to be more thorough next time.***

***Alright, sounds good. That's it for today, but let me know if you have any concerns.***

***Will do. And, thanks for taking the time to talk with me today. I appreciate the feedback.***

# III.pattern
***So, Lauren, let's talk about our new sales rep, Jason.***

***Sure. What's up?***

***Basically, I'm having concerns about his performance. He doesn't seem to be a good fit.***

***Really? What makes you say that? He seems pretty competent.***

***I feel like he's unreliable. Sometimes he's really productive, but other times he lacks focus.***

***Could you be more specific?***

***Sure. Take last Tuesday for instance. He fell asleep in our morning meeting.***

***That's not very professional. He's usually full of energy.***

***He's also missed a few deadlines. The bottom line is he needs to change.***

***Ok. I'll bring it up with him and try to coach him.***

***Hey, Ross, have you done your 360 reviews yet?***

***Nah, I’m not really sure what to write. Peer assessments always seem so convoluted.***

***It’s pretty easy, actually. Just follow the prompts and focus on what your colleague does well in their position.***

***Oh, so you don’t write about deficiencies?***

***Not unless it’s a major issue. And no need to ramble on. They’re supposed to be short and sweet so you don’t get tired out.***

***That doesn’t seem so bad. But, honestly, I wonder if these reviews actually help the business. Seems like it’s just another administrative hoop to jump through.***

***Well, if the implementation is flawed, yeah, it can be a waste of time. But when done right, it’s a highly equitable process.***

***The 360 review focuses more on how the employee affects the work of others and contributes to the whole organization. The goal is to provide balanced and actionable feedback.***

***Hmm, now I’m starting to see the point of these evaluations.***

***Absolutely. The whole point of having multiple raters is to get feedback from all angles, hence the name 360. When you take all that together, you end up with a really good gauge of someone’s skills and potential.***

***That does make sense, actually. I better get on that, then.***

# III.pattern
***Good morning Mr. Gibbons! Thanks again for meeting with me this morning.***

***No problem, Stacey. So what is this 360-degree feedback review you wanted to talk about?***

***Well, in our last meeting you expressed interest in implementing a system of review where the employee would gain valuable feedback that would help him or her develop business and interpersonal skills. I’ve done my research and found that the 360-degree system does just that.***

***I haven’t heard of this system before. Tell me more about it.***

***The manager isn't the only one involved in evaluating the employee; peers and customers do it as well. Because it’s not just one person evaluating the employee, the employee is getting an abundant feedback that can be candid, constructive and help the employee realize what they need to improve on.***

***What are everyone’s roles and responsibilities?***

***The 360-degree feedback system needs an administrator, reviewers, the manager and the employee or subject. The administrator can be me, or someone else in HR and the reviewers can be the employee’s co- workers or some clients, that he or she has dealt with in the past. It’ll all be anonymous, so the employee won’t know whom the feedback is from.***

***Before we start using this feedback system we should make sure that all those participating are aware of what we are doing, ready for it and willing to take part.***

***How should we make certain everyone is ready to cooperate with this new feedback system?***

***We should have a few workshops explaining what the 360-degree feedback system is and how it’ll be useful for them as opposed to conventional methods of performance evaluation.***

***We could even have those involved in leadership and manager roles undergo the 360 reviews first. It’ll be good to show an example of what to do during these reviews from the top; we’ll build a positive culture of feedback.***

***Ok, one more thing, can you tell me about the process of the 360 review?***

***The first step is to meet the subject. Ensure they understand how everything is going to work and determine what their expectations are. The second step is to talk with the subject’s manager. Figure out if the manager's goals and expectations are aligned with the subject’s; if they aren’t this may not be the best feedback method.***

***Also, we’ll ask the manager to compose a list of co-workers the subject has known for a few years. These people could be the reviewers. The third step is to send out the review. We can either do a one-on-one interview or send out a survey via email to the reviewers. The fourth step is to review all the feedback and compile a report. And the final step is to deliver the results.***

***Hey Mark, how did your performance review go?***

***Hi Diane. I actually bombed it.***

***Oh no! Did you really, or are you exaggerating?***

***Nope, I'm being straight up. I think my supervisor has a bit of a bias against me.***

***Really, I've always found him on the level and unprejudiced.***

***Do you think you could give me your take on how I should move forward?***

***You bet! I'll give you an unbiased perspective.***

***So, what do I do now?***

***Well, you can decide if you want to be proactive or reactive. The former is more constructive.***

***So I should ask what I need to do to get a rating of 'Exceeds Expectations' next year?***

***Not exactly. Your boss won't be able to predict the future, and that's a vague question.***

***Then what?***

***Ask him how you could make a more valuable contribution to the company.***

***Oh ok, then he can give me more tangible ways to improve.***

***You got it!***
