# I.Tips for how to handle criticism
> Being sensitive to criticism can be a sticky situation. Sometimes people may even stop working toward a goal out of fear of being critiqued. Here are some helpful tips to handle any kind of criticism that heads our way.

# 1.Listen up
> Figure out whether the criticism is constructive [有益] or simply rude [单纯的无理宣泄]. You may feel hurt when your partner says you're controlling [强势], but having him point out this flaw [指出你的缺点] may help you change and ultimately save the relationship. If criticism could be helpful, lend all ears [洗耳恭听] and try to learn from it instead of getting defensive [心怀戒备].

# 2.Don't take it personally [不要把批评当成私人恩怨]
> Try to remove yourself from the situation and focus on what's being critiqued /krɪ'tik/ [vt.批判]. That C+ midterm [期中考试] doesn't reflect your A+ personality [A+人格]! Instead, it's a reminder to study a little harder next time, skip all that partying the night before, or realize that calculus /'kælkjələs/ [微积分] simply isn't your biggest strength.

# 3.Manage stress [控制压力]
> When we're constantly on edge, we can feel out of control [失控] and unable to respond to criticism with a clear head. So take a deep breath to keep those stress levels in check.

# II.How to evaluate an employee's performance
> Employee performance evaluation is a key factor to inspire your employees, improve the quality of work, and keep them motivated. There are some important points to consider when you evaluate a team member.

# 1.Quality of work
> In the world of web, our most important data point is the quality of work that our employees create.This is measured through regular review of our client deliverables, their role in client efforts, stability of the production changes/platform, best practices, and feedback from the client.

# 2. Level of creativity
> Creativity is one of the most important points in evaluating employee performance.How often did the employee question basic assumptions about a problem and come up with a new solution? Did they think outside of the box and successfully take risks on their own?

# 3.Amount of consistent improvement
> No employee has the capacity to be truly excellent at every evaluation point on our quarterly review form; however, every employee has the opportunity to improve each day, month, quarter, and year.The desire and effort to become better is the most rewardable quality.

# III.grammar
# 1.I couldn’t help (but) + v./ + reflexive /rɪ'flɛksɪv/ pronoun [反身代词].
> 1)The base of the phrase “I couldn’t help but + verb” means that you cannot control this action and did this unintentionally.  it means that "I had no control over this."

> 2)So, by saying “I couldn’t help but notice,” you are showing that you were not actively looking for this person’s mistakes.The phrase “I couldn’t help but notice” can be used to politely bring up a problem. For example, “I couldn’t help but notice that your reports have been a bit late.”

> 3)Note: It’s possible to omit “but” and say “I couldn’t help + verb-ing” (e.g, I couldn’t help noticing). However, adding “but” makes it more polite and formal.

> 4)We can also say, “I couldn’t help + reflexive /rɪ'flɛksɪv/ pronoun.” This means that the person has no control over themselves. (I couldn’t help myself! I ate the entire box of cookies.)

- 1. I couldn't help but notice that you've been looking really tired.

- 2. I couldn't help but notice that she's been really upset.

- 3. They were so loud when they were talking. I couldn't help but overhear their conversation.

# 2.take + n + for instance 
> Basically when we use this phrase, we're kind of saying "for example."it is used to introduce a specific person or thing that helps explain a statement. It has a very similar meaning to "For example."

> 2)You could say "take a day" like "take last Tuesday." You could say a person, like "Take Jason for example, he's so lazy." Or take Beijing for instance, it's such a huge city.It's such a huge city. So Jason. It looks like he fell asleep during a morning meeting. I can't ever imagine doing that. That's not very professional.

- 1. I love everything about her. Take her smile for instance. It lights up the whole room.

- 2. Every day, I'm busy. Take last Thursday for instance. I didn't even have time for lunch.

- 3. Take for instance the professor's decision to not give us an exam.

# 3.regarding [prep.关于] & in regards to & concerns [n.担忧]
> 1)So "regarding" just means "about," kind of "related to this." For example, "I wrote an email regarding my new car."Or when you start a job, you might have questions regarding your pay.about your pay. It can also be used to introduce something. For example, maybe in an email I write, "Hey, regarding the budget, we need to spend less money."

> 2)Now you could also say "in regards to," but that is more formal.

> 3)If we're ever worried about something you can just say, "I'm having concerns about..." And then you can say what it is you're worried about.But it's a little more polite and maybe not as worried as the word "worry,"say you're feeling sick, you could say, "I'm having concerns about my health."

# 4.bring it/sth up with sb [phr.提起、提及]
> 1) it's usually just for things that we need to talk about. Like if you're with a girlfriend or boyfriend and you have some troubles because everyone has troubles in a relationship, you need to bring those up and talk about them before they explode into a big disaster.Say I have something at work I need to do with you, I can bring it up with you.And we can replace it with the thing that we want to bring up, so we can say bring our problems up.

> 2)And we can replace it with the thing that we want to bring up, so we can say bring our problems up.You can say "bring it up" or "bring the thing up," but you cannot say "bring up it."Make sure you have the "it" between.

# 5.to clarify [v.澄清、确认、说明] & clarification [n.]
> "To clarify" means to "make this clear."To make it clear, to explain something that might be confusing.To make it clear, to explain something that might be confusing. So for example, if you're in a meeting you could say, "Could you clarify that? I didn't quite understand."Or if you said something confusing which I often do, I might say, "Oh, wait wait wait, let me clarify that."

> 2)and so one might say, "Thanks for the clarification."This is a pretty polite word. It's kind of similar to that phrasal verb "clear up."

# 6.accordingly [adv.相应的]
> this just means the correct way or appropriately. or following this schedule. when you get a new job, there might be a dress code. Maybe you have to dress according to that dress code. You have to dress accordingly. so you have to follow the rules.Follow the rules, exactly, Or I think of, if someone goes to dinner at a guesthouse, they have to act accordingly. They have to behave well.you have to be polite. And in situations like this, you also have to act accordingly.

# 7.renewal /rɪ'nuəl/ [n.重建;更新] & renewal rate & renew [v.]
> 1)so when we talk about renewal, we talk about someone signing up for something again. Or if you're talking about a product, a customer buying the product again, if they renew, then that means that they continually try to buy this product.

> 2)So maybe for example, at the beginning you have ten customers, and only five customers buy the service again, that means the renewal rate is only fifty percent, only half of the people are doing that.And so she says that the renewal rate is not as high as they could be, that he needs to work harder at that and make sure the employee... that he needs to work harder of that and make sure that the people that are buying these things are buying it again in larger numbers.

> 3) So renewing is the verb to do something again, ah so these clients are not renewing their contract, they're not signing up their contract again with this company.

# 8.thorough /'θɝo/ [adj.详细的、细致的]
> If you are thorough,  it means you're careful, you look at all the details and you don't make any errors.So you can check something "thoroughly," that is the adverb version.

# 9.work related words
## 1)feedback & positive / constructive feedback [n.建设性的反馈]
> 1)So "feedback.",these are the responses that you get from your boss about how you're doing. these are the criticisms about you. This is just opinions. like you did a good job. You did a bad job. This is all feedback. if I do some work, I usually ask somebody else for feedback. Just "What you think about this, is it good? Is it bad? Tell me how to make it better."so you could also get customer feedback, Like companies, in order to make their product better, they need to get feedback. They need to get the opinions of the customers.that's really important. And hopefully they get a lot of positive feedback.

> 2)So if she said, "I appreciate the criticism." It might feel like she's taking it a little personally, like she's sad.A little rude as well. It's like "Hey, it's not criticism, it's feedback, it's positive."So it's better to just say "I appreciate the feedback." Don't say "I appreciate the criticism."

> 3)And constructive means that it helps you out, that it's not just "oh your doing a bad job", it's "oh you really need to work on your customer service skills". 

## 2)workload [n.工作量]
> This is a great noun. It just means you know how much work you're getting, how much work you have to do. so you could have a heavy workload—you can have a lot of work to do—or a light workload.

## 3)timeline [n.时间线、时间表] & schedule 
> 1)the timeline is just the schedule or plan.We often use it when we're asking, for example, how much time something will take, like "What's your timeline?"or you might ask someone to make more detailed timeline.And verbs we use with this, you can provide a timeline. But timeline can be too short, so you need to make it more detailed. 

> 2)But here it just means schedule. Sometimes it takes people a while to get used to the new timeline.

## 4)establish/maintain communications 
> 1) "establishing", you can also say, for example, that you establish a new country, you arrive somewhere and say this is my new country, I am establishing a new country or a new city or something like that.So when you establish communications that means that you're setting it up, you're making it known that they can communicate with you, that they can contact you and talk to you.

> 2) maintaining in its basic definition means to make sure that it stays good, so you can maintain your car, make sure that your car doesn't have any problems, or maintain a relationship with a good friend that you guys are both happy with your relationship.And when you want to maintain something that means that you want to continue having something, so you want to maintain your, their business that means that you want them to continue buying your product or service.

## 5)keep the lines of communication open with sb [n.交流方式]
> 1)So these lines are communication, they're just the connection that you have between you and the customer, between the business and the customer. So they need, they need to be open, the customer needs to be able to communicate with you.

> 2) and feel like they can communicate with you when they have a problem, and vice versa, if you need to tell something to the customer, it should be easy for you to talk to the customer. And then she finishes by saying, this will prevent any unsolved customer complaints.

# 10.performance related words
## 1)performance [n.表现、业绩]
> 1)so your performance is how well you do something.A job or an activity or a task. If you did it well, then your performance was good.you performed well. But you could perform poorly. If you perform poorly, then you might get a bad performance review.So that's when—at like the end of the year, —they look over how well you did at work.many companies have performance reviews. A performance review talks about how well a person, an employee is performing. How well they're doing. Are they doing a good job? Are they getting good results?So we always want to perform our best, give our best performance.

> 2)But it can be used for other things too, like a machine or a phone. Maybe your smartphone is not performing well.Or when we talk about cars, we can say that maybe, "I bought a high-performance car."Like a race car.

## 2)biannual [adj.一年两次]
> And biannual means that it's twice a year, so they do these performance evaluations twice a year.

## 3)move up the corporate ladder [phr.职业晋升]
> So this corporate ladder is the path from a beginning position at the company to a really high position.So we talk about a ladder, a ladder is, of course, something that you walk up to go from a low place to a high place. See you started at the bottom and then you slowly go to the top.

## 4)the rating sacle & meeting/exceeding expectations & self-evaluation [n.自我评价]
> 1)the rating scale here is, number five means that you are meeting and exceeding all of their expectations. And then number one is the opposite that you're not meeting or exceeding any expectations and you need to work on improving.

> 2)So expectations are things that you're supposed to do at your job, what your boss tells you to do and when you meet them that means that you're doing them, you're doing all those things.When you are exceeding them that means that you're doing them and you're doing more, you're going above and beyond what your supposed to do.

> 3)So this is the way that performance evaluations usually work. You get a piece of paper that has different categories, and you rate yourself first. You say in this category I am doing a five, I'm meeting and exceeding all expectations.And this category maybe is customer service, maybe is showing up to work on time, maybe I'm a three, I'm ok, not great not bad. Maybe in those other categories of my job I'm only a one. I really need to improve.

## 5)competent [adj.有能力的]
> 1)When we're talking about being competent, we're talking about your skills or your ability at the job.Can he do a good job? If he can do a good job, then he's competent. If he can't do a good job, then he's probably incompetent.If you're incompetent, you're probably a bad fit for the job.We don't use it a lot in our day-to-day speaking, but if you're in a workplace, it's okay to use it.

> 2)And this really is a kind of a formal word, "competent," If I'm at home with my friends and I can't... I don't know... fix something, I wouldn't say "I'm just so incompetent." Yeah, that's not very nice.

## 6)good fit [合适的人]

> 2)But in this case, Jason's not a good fit for the company.This is a really good phrase at a company. And it is kind of a set phrase. For example, we don't say, he doesn't fit well. We usually say he is not a good fit, just like in this sentence.If they're not a good fit, we can just say, "he's a bad fit" or "they are a bad fit."

## 7)productive [adj.高效的，有效率的]
> This is a good adjective. It just means that you are good at making things.You can produce things. That's where this word, this adjective comes from. It comes from the verb to produce. A lot of apps on my phone, are like productivity apps. That's the noun, for making me more productive like a to-do list or an organizer or schedule or calendar. Those are all for making me more productive.I need to use those all the time, otherwise I am just lost.maybe that's because you lack focus.

## 8)bottom line [n.底线、最重要的事]
> This could be used in all kinds of different situations, like if you're doing a project and there are so many complicated details and finally your boss says the bottom line is we don't have enough money. We can't do this.Or say you're traveling, but you have so many things to do, but you just need to get to this one city, so you can say the bottom line is I need to get to where I'm going.But the bottom line is we don't have enough time.

## 9)lack sth
> If you lack something, it basically means you're without it or you don't have enough of it.usually we use "lack" more when we're talking about our personality. So things that we don't have related to us. But if it's like an item like milk or sugar, we wouldn't use lack. We just say "I don't have..."or I'm out. Because of that "lack" is kind of a more formal word.We use it more when we're talking about ourselves or someone else in a formal way.

# 11.teach & coach
> 1)"Teach" just sounds like too much... just telling him how to do it.And teaching in my mind makes me think you teach them once and it's over.

> 2)While "coach" is more like you're doing it together.coaching is kind of an ongoing thing.so we have these phrases like “a life coach”,”a soccer coach.”

# 12.rep [n.代表]
> 1)So that word "rep" is just short for "representative." but that word's too long. Representative. It's even hard to say representative. It's tough, so we just say rep.shorten it down and we have all sorts of reps. 

> 2)a sales rep, but you can also have a customer service rep, or a company rep—someone who represents a company.if you call, for example, an airline to change your plane ticket, you will talk to a customer service rep which is kind of like a company agent.So you could say, "customer service agent."
