# I.Best ice breaker games
# 1.Truth and lies
> Rules: Sit everyone in a circle facing each other. Have each person come up with three facts about themselves and one lie. The lie should be realistic instead of extravagant /ɪk'strævəgənt/ [adj.过度的,过分的,放肆的]. Go around the circle and have each person state the three facts and a lie in a random /'rændəm/ [adj.任意的] order, without revealing which is the lie. After someone shares, the others must guess which is the lie.

> Objective: This is a great ice breaker game, especially for new teams. Helps eliminate snap /snæp/ [adj.突然的] judgements of colleagues[消除对同事的偏见], and gives introverts /'ɪntrəvɝt/ [n.性格内向的人] an equal chance to share some facts about themselves.

# 2.The barter /'bɑrtɚ/ puzzle [拼图交换]
> Rules: Have everyone break off into small, equal-sized groups[相同人数的小组]. Give each group a different jigsaw /'dʒɪɡsɔ/ [拼图玩具] puzzle with the same difficulty level. The goal is to see which group can complete their jigsaw puzzle the fastest. However! Some pieces will be mixed around in other group's jigsaw puzzles. It's up to the team to come up with a way to get those pieces back — either through negotiating, trading, exchanging team members, etc. Whatever they decide to do, they must decide as a group.

> Objective: This activity will rely heavily [高度依赖] on problem solving and leadership skills. Some team members might stand out and some might stand back[比较收敛], but it's important to remember that the entire team must come to a consensus /kən'sɛnsəs/ [n.(意见等)一致,一致同意] before a decision is made.

# 3.Blind drawing [我说你画]
> Rules: Divide everyone into groups of two. Have the two individuals sitting back-to-back. Give one person the pen and paper and the other person the picture. The person with the picture describes the picture to their teammate without actually saying what it is. The person with the pen and paper draws what they think the picture depicts, based on the verbal description. Set a time limit for 10 - 15 minutes.

> Objective: This is an activity that focuses on interpretation [传达] and communication. Once the drawing is finished, it's always interesting to see how the drawer interprets [解释] their partner's description.

# II.grammar
# 1.let's just say 
> The phrase “let’s just say” and “let’s say” is often used to introduce a hypothetical  /ˌhaɪpə'θɛtɪkl/ [adj.假设的] situation. However, in this lesson, it has a different meaning. It’s used to downplay /ˌdaʊn'ple/ [vt.将...轻描淡写] the severity /sə'vɛrəti/ [n.严格] of something, but the implied meaning is that it’s much more extreme. It can be used as an indirect /ˌɪndə'rɛkt/ [adj.间接的] or vague way of saying something negative about a person or situation.

- 1. Many people think she’s picky, but let’s just say she’s selective. 

- 2. Let’s just say he wasn’t pleased about what happened. 

- 3. Let’s just say Trisha wasn’t exactly the life of the party.

***Hey Ralph, did you hear? We’re having a team building event with the new employees next week.***

***Yeah, I got the memo. I hope you’re ready for some tug of war and paintballing.***

***Oh, I’m bringing my A game, so the real question is are you ready?***

***Well, to hear you talk like that, let’s just say I hope we’re on the same team. Either way, I’m really looking forward to socializing with everyone.***

***Me too. I also think it will be a great opportunity to boost our teamwork skills.***

***Likewise. Competing with each other will help us bond and build team spirit that we can later use in the office.***

***Definitely. We will also learn more about each other’s strengths, weaknesses and interests, which is vital for collaborating on projects.***

***Yeah, and it’s cool that we get to do so in a fun, carefree manner outside of the office.***
