# Introduing new colleague
# I.grammar
# 1.drop in /drɑp ɪn/ 拜访、来访
> So very often you'll actually hear that people say the expression, please feel free to drop in and say hi.it's all like one piece like a really set sentence.and it just means I'd love to see you at any time.please visit.

# 2.join me in welcoming [和我一起欢迎]
> we always have to follow this with a gerund, with an ing, so please join me in doing something, and that just means come with me or participate with me, do it together, exactly.Very formal, great for a business situation, you wouldn't say," Hey, Connor, please join me in going for dinner tonight."But in a work environment, it's perfect, and it's used all the time whenever a new person is introduced to their colleagues, or their co-workers.Or even like at a speech or conference or something, introduces speaker.

# 3.get started /going [开始]
> 1) get started doing something. We also say things like get going, it means to begin something.to begin. There's a chance, there's starting.So when you start a new job, it's really good to say something like I'm super excited to start working here, it just shows you're enthusiastic.you want to be part of the team and contribute.

# 4.with that [phr.说到这里、接下来]
> it's just a really nice transition to, it's a little more formal, but it has a nice flow to what you're saying, so it's not broken speech and very abrupt.It's better than saying next.not from your boss.And it's just a really nice transition to, it's a little more formal, but it has a nice flow to what you're saying, so it's not broken speech and very abrupt.It's better than saying next.

# 5.PR & public relations
> Basically it's media marketing, if there's any new stories, social media, very important. Right. So here you just want to make sure that you're saying public relations with an s, and not public relation or public relationship, that's kind of awkward, but public relations is the expression.

# 6.hold job/positions [在某个职位] & hold/keep down my job [保住职位]
> 1）hold job/positions：It's more formal, but it just means, she worked in that position.That's just the word that we use with position, a position like a job, it doesn't mean she's holding it in her hand, it means she did that.

> 2)hold/keep down my job:which means I've kept my job.

- She has held some various positions in the world's largest agencies.

# 7.firm & agency 
> so earlier we saw the word firm, so this is like a business, now the agency is similar, but it's more client based, so you're serving a client.agency is doing some specific purpose.So there's lots of kinds of agencies, right? Like PR agencies.Advertising, marketing, lots, especially in the advertising area, I guess, dealing with people doing client work.

# 8.looking forward to [v.期待] & expecting
> 1)so this is an essential thing you should say I'm really looking forward to, so it means like excited, I'm excited to.It's, I'm looking ahead and I really am pleased about this, and right, I'm excited.it's just casual,or natural.this one seems to flow off your tongue a little bit better, more natural, and it's definitely more friendly and it makes her more approachable.

> 2)one thing you should be careful here, a lot of students I've seen say expecting, I'm expecting to join your team, but we don't use expect in this situation, we use look forward to.

# 9.on board [phr.新加入、同意]
> 1）this is not standing on a board, this is like being part of the team.so when you say for example, if you get on board a plane or on board a ship, or a train.Or a subway.It's the same thing you are joining it.Joining it, so you're gonna go together.

- We are equally excited about having you on board.

> 2)Welcome on board. And sometimes it even means agreement, are you on board? so if you agree with what someone is going to do, you'll say," Sure, I'm on board with that."I agree, let's do that. and if you don't, I'm not on board, I'm jumping ship.

# 10.some point [phr.某个时间段]
> So can you drop by my office some point today? And we usually say at some point.at some point, because it's a short time, Iike at three o'clock.

# 11.door is always open/open door policy/open door rule [phr.门一直敞开]
> it means come in anytime to talk to me.and another way to say this is I have an open door policy. like an open door rule.so at any time if you are worried or stressed out or have a problem, come and visit me.
