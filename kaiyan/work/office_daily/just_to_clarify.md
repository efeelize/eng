# Just_to_clarify

# I.Tips for asking for clarification
> It’s okay to ask for an explanation if you don’t understand. In fact, guessing and getting it wrong is more likely to cause problems than politely asking for more info.There are a few simple steps to follow when you’re looking for further explanation.

# 1. Admit you need clarification
> Admitting you need more information makes the next step much easier for the person you ask. Don’t be vague, simply state that you don’t understand.

# 2. Don’t blame the other person
> Own your confusion.[承认是自己没弄清楚] Don’t say anything that sounds accusatory /ə'kjuzətɔri/ [adj.质问]. You’ll get a much better response from, “Would you explain that to me again?” than “That was as clear as mud![你说的一点都不清楚]”

# 3.Summarize
> If the conversation has been a lengthy or complexone /kəm'plɛkʃən/ [冗长复杂], it can be helpful to give the other person a summary of what’s taken place up to this point[向对方总结好你的问题].

# 4.Be specific
> If there’s a specific thing that’s unclear to you, name it[直说就好]. Don’t make the other person flail around trying to figure out what you do understand and what you don’t.

# II.grammar 
# 1.at the + 
> 1)The pattern “at + the + superlative adjective” is often used when setting a time or when giving a minimum or maximum. For example, in today’s lesson Emma said that she’d like “10 pages at the most.” This means that she wants a maximum of 10 pages. When saying minimums, we say “at the least.”[“at + the + 形容词最高级”的结构通常用于设定时间或给出最大最小值.]

> 2)Likewise, “at the latest” is used when giving a final deadline or time. The opposite phrase is “at the earliest.”

> 3)Note that when using “most” and “least,” we can remove “the.” However, the phrases “at the latest” and “at the earliest” require “the.”[要注意，使用 “most” 和“least”时，“the”可以省略，但使用“at the latest” 和 “at the earliest”时，“the”不能省略.]

- we'll need at least 3 people.

- Let's meet at 8 AM at the earliest.

- At the most,it's a 10 minute walk from here.

# 2.clarify /'klærəfaɪ/ [v] & clarification /ˌklærəfəˈkeʃən/ & confirm /kən'fɝm/ [v.确认] & confirmation /ˌkɑnfɚ'meʃən/ [n]
> 1)so to clarify just means to make something clear.So you can clarify an address, you can clarify some information, you can clarify anything.

> 2)And when you ask them these questions, you're asking for "clarification".

> 3)we use "clarify" when we are confused and we want to make something clear, but "to confirm something" means, "I think that I'm right, but, I wanna check".

> 4)And just note the pronunciation, we say "confirmation" (/ˌkɑnfɚ'meʃən/),we say "confirm" (/kən'fɝm/).

# 3.report[n. & v.] [报告] & info & reporter [n.记者]
> 1)so the report. If you guys work, especially if you work at an office, you have probably written a report, read a report, seen a report, looked at a report.it's like a essay,but a work essay 

> 2) I said the word "information" before, "information" is a very long word, we often just say "info".

> 3）reporter: there also is a job, a reporter, although a reporter doesn't often write reports.they write the news.So they write articles.

# 4.divide & split & sections [n.部分] & headings [n.标题] & headers [n.标题]
> 1)so "divide", this makes me think about math class.Yeah like, "6 divided by 3 is 2".

> 2)We often say, "split something into two" or "split something into three".she just wants him to separate the report into smaller parts. But "split" is a little bit different from "divide", it's a little bit more casual.it's the same thing, it's just we tend to use "divide" in more formal situations, like at work for example.

> 3)Another more formal word is also "sections".So if you're looking at a report, the first section is probably going to be called "introduction".it's just the first part. And now if you're reading a book or whatever, and they usually have different lessons, "chapter one", "chapter two", "chapter three", these are all different sections.

> 4)a heading is just a title, but often titles can be names for entire books, but headings can be names for sections.

> 5) The header is the same thing, basically it's at the top of the slide. And we should actually probably talk about slides, and we didn't, we didn't talk about that yet. So in a presentation, you have a page on the screen, we call that a slides[幻灯片].so a presentation is made up of multiple slides.and those headers you can kind of think of them like titles.

# 5.hand it in [phr.上交、提交] & put in [v.提交]
> 1)so "to hand it in" means "to submit it", but it's a little bit more casual and friendly.You could also hand in your homework, or you could hand in a lost item to the police.

> 2)So anyway this phrase, put in a request is very common and it's kind of a chunk, we often use it in this way.

# 6.will do [phr.我会的]
> it just means "I will do that".Yeah, so you can use it, you know, in person, or in, I guess, short message?

# 7.on the same page [phr.想法一致、达成共识]
> when you're on the same page, it means that you understand each other, you're talking about the same thing.
