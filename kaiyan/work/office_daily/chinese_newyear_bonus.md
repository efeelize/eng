# I.4 secrets to getting a better performance evaluation
# 1. Let your manager know that you're looking forward to your evaluation.
> One reason managers worry about evaluations is that they assume they're nerve-wracking /'nɝv,rækɪŋ/ [烦恼]for employees. If you make it clear that you're looking forward to feedback, you immediately make the process more pleasant.

# 2. Evaluate yourself first. 
> List out how much progress you've made toward your goals and what you'd like to do better in the coming year. If you provide this to your manager, there's a good chance that he/she will pull directly from it when she writes her own.[会很可能从中直接引用内容]

# 3. Keep an evaluation file throughout the year. [全年都要记录好评估档案]
> Keep a file where you jot down /dʒɒt/ /daʊn/ [记录] notes on project successes during the year, so that it's helpful when you're reflecting on your performance during evaluation time. 

# 4.Ask colleagues to give feedback to your manager. 
> Think of who particularly appreciates the work you do and tell them you'd be grateful if they'd provide input to your manager. [向领导提供关于你绩效的反馈]

# II.End of year bonuses in America
> About 80% of American companies hand out bonuses [发奖金] at the end of the year to show their appreciation for employees' hard work, but how are they calculated?

> Some bosses give a fixed bonus across the board[倾向于所有人奖金都一样], which most experts advise against[不建议], as it reinforces the idea that just showing up will grant you extra money at the year's end[实际上只是在年底给所有人都多发一笔钱]. A performance-based system is usually recommended, and this will depend on how well both the company and the individual did. Usually calculated as a percentage of your base salary, it also means that the higher your salary, the more you get.

> There are those who argue against monetary incentives[金钱激励], citing studies that show financial rewards[激励方式] are not a good motivator /'məutiveitə/ for good performance[很好的改善绩效]. It could also create jealousy among employees with huge salary disparities /dɪ'spærəti/ [n.悬殊]. For example, a 30% bonus for an entry-level employee [职场新人] would only be a fraction of the bonus that a higher salaried coworker gets. [可能只有他们薪水更高的同事的一小部分]

> However, companies are beginning to realize just how important it is to retain top talent[留住顶尖人才]. Bonuses put the focus on performance[奖金关注于绩效], and allow companies to reward their most valuable employees while keeping them from having to commit to a higher base salary[防止他们要求高底薪], which is harder to maintain when the economy or the company doesn't do well[这样当经济或公司不景气的时候，公司压力会很大]. In fact, many argue that companies shouldn't only offer a lump /lʌmp/ [一块] year-end bonus [年底的时候发一次奖金] and instead implement year-round recognition through mid-year bonuses [半年奖金] as well as spot rewards for milestones /'maɪlston/  achieved [重大成就奖金] throughout the year. It makes people feel appreciated, and immediate feedback reinforces /ˌriɪn'fɔrs/ [vt.增强;加强] hard work, as well as an organization's vision[组织意识]. In turn, it increases loyalty and motivation, leading to higher employee satisfaction.

> Many Silicon Valley companies offer a minimal 15% annual salary as an end of year bonus tied to performance evaluation[和绩效挂钩]. Many also offer a sign-on bonus [签约奖金] equivalent to one month's salary [额外一个月的薪水] in order to attract top talent.[以此吸引人才]

# III.grammar
# 1.In a position to do something
>  When you aren't in a position to do something, you are either unable to do it or don't have the authority to.

- 1. I really wish I could help, but I'm not in a position to work on marketing campaigns.[没有资格处理市场活动这块的工作]

- 2. My wife and I are lucky to be in a position [有条件] to send our daughter to an international school. 

- 3. Once I switched to my new job, I was in a position to travel more often.[有机会]

***Hi Kate, thanks for coming in. Let's talk about your annual performance evaluation and bonus.***

***Let's start with your work. You not only put in the most overtime, but also brought in many new customers.***

***It's been a busy year. I noticed we needed extra help, so I decided to step up.***

***Thank you for being so proactive. It's been key to our success.***

***My pleasure. I'm always happy to take on more responsibility.***

***Good to hear. To show my gratitude, I've decided to give you a Chinese New Year bonus.***

***Wow, that's so generous of you! I really appreciate it.***

***Zack, do you have some time to discuss the end of year bonuses?***

***That's right. We weren't really in a position to do it before. But with the help of new funding as we scale up, we need to formalize rewards and bonuses to help us retain and attract talent.***

***Absolutely. So is this something you'd like to have for people across the board or just key staff?***

***Well, I'm still on the fence. What do you think?***

***People are going to talk. We don't want to be in a situation where bonuses create jealousy.***

***I see where you're coming from. At the same time, we also want to reward top performers and incentivize others to up their game.***

***Correct. That's why I'd suggest using a tiered system. Of course, it should all be performance-based.***

***Well, we don't have performance evaluations for all the staff yet as we've just started to build a proper HR system.***

***That's alright. What we can do is formalize a bonus scheme for core roles and tie it to their performance. For roles that are non-core, it's up to you whether you want to give bonuses or just perks instead.***

***Ok, I'll think about it. How much of a bonus should we give?***

***I'd suggest starting with one month's salary for top performers since this is the first year we're doing bonuses. We can always go up in the future.***
