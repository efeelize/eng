# I.4 secrets to getting a better performance evaluation
# 1. Let your manager know that you're looking forward to your evaluation.
> One reason managers worry about evaluations is that they assume they're nerve-wracking /'nɝv,rækɪŋ/ [烦恼]for employees. If you make it clear that you're looking forward to feedback, you immediately make the process more pleasant.

# 2. Evaluate yourself first. 
> List out how much progress you've made toward your goals and what you'd like to do better in the coming year. If you provide this to your manager, there's a good chance that he/she will pull directly from it when she writes her own.[会很可能从中直接引用内容]

# 3. Keep an evaluation file throughout the year. [全年都要记录好评估档案]
> Keep a file where you jot down /dʒɒt/ /daʊn/ [记录] notes on project successes during the year, so that it's helpful when you're reflecting on your performance during evaluation time. 

# 4.Ask colleagues to give feedback to your manager. 
> Think of who particularly appreciates the work you do and tell them you'd be grateful if they'd provide input to your manager. [向领导提供关于你绩效的反馈]

# II.End of year bonuses in America
> About 80% of American companies hand out bonuses [发奖金] at the end of the year to show their appreciation for employees' hard work, but how are they calculated?

> Some bosses give a fixed bonus across the board[倾向于所有人奖金都一样], which most experts advise against[不建议], as it reinforces the idea that just showing up will grant you extra money at the year's end[实际上只是在年底给所有人都多发一笔钱]. A performance-based system is usually recommended, and this will depend on how well both the company and the individual did. Usually calculated as a percentage of your base salary, it also means that the higher your salary, the more you get.

> There are those who argue against monetary incentives[金钱激励], citing studies that show financial rewards[激励方式] are not a good motivator /'məutiveitə/ for good performance[很好的改善绩效]. It could also create jealousy among employees with huge salary disparities /dɪ'spærəti/ [n.悬殊]. For example, a 30% bonus for an entry-level employee [职场新人] would only be a fraction of the bonus that a higher salaried coworker gets. [可能只有他们薪水更高的同事的一小部分]

> However, companies are beginning to realize just how important it is to retain top talent[留住顶尖人才]. Bonuses put the focus on performance[奖金关注于绩效], and allow companies to reward their most valuable employees while keeping them from having to commit to a higher base salary[防止他们要求高底薪], which is harder to maintain when the economy or the company doesn't do well[这样当经济或公司不景气的时候，公司压力会很大]. In fact, many argue that companies shouldn't only offer a lump /lʌmp/ [一块] year-end bonus [年底的时候发一次奖金] and instead implement year-round recognition through mid-year bonuses [半年奖金] as well as spot rewards for milestones /'maɪlston/  achieved [重大成就奖金] throughout the year. It makes people feel appreciated, and immediate feedback reinforces /ˌriɪn'fɔrs/ [vt.增强;加强] hard work, as well as an organization's vision[组织意识]. In turn, it increases loyalty and motivation, leading to higher employee satisfaction.

> Many Silicon Valley companies offer a minimal 15% annual salary as an end of year bonus tied to performance evaluation[和绩效挂钩]. Many also offer a sign-on bonus [签约奖金] equivalent to one month's salary [额外一个月的薪水] in order to attract top talent.[以此吸引人才]

# 2.evaluation [n.评价] & performance evaluation [n.绩效考核]
> 1)so an evaluation is just a review. It's looking back at someone's work over the year. So they take kind of information like, how much overtime [n.加班时间] they did, how much money they earn for the company, and then they use that as their evaluation to determine whether they'll get a promotion or a bonus.

> 2)we can evaluate other things besides employees, right? Maybe you don't know what school you're gonna go to, so you say, "I need to evaluate my options."

# 3.bonus /'bonəs/ [pl.bonuses] & perks [n.福利，非现金形式发放]
> 1)So, "a bonus" is just money that you usually get at the end of the year, and it's money added to your salary. So, it's kind of like extra salary.

> 2)A bonus can also just be something good, right?Sure, exactly. Sometimes when I hear really good news, I just say, "Oh, bonus."

> 3)So a perk here is going to be. It's something good, something people want, advantage. But it's not related to money.So for example, a perk might be free lunch or like a paid gym membership.

Maybe you step up when people need help or something needs to be done. we often hear a line like, "oh, we were falling behind, so I had to step up." Or, "I stepped up because no one else was doing anything."

> 2)So "take on" is another phrasal verb that we always use at work. And it, basically, just means "start doing more things" or "be responsible for more things."Or maybe you have a second job, so you can say, "Hey, I had to take on a second job to make some more money."

> 3)So, here she is more "being put on" these bigger projects. So, her boss's kind of giving it to her, right? So usually, when we're taking things on, we're doing it because we want to. We're doing it because it's our choice. And usually, when we are put on something, it's because it's someone else's choice.

> 4)When you're upping your game you are improving.I think it means different things in different circumstances. But in the workplace it means, you know, getting more sales, increasing your numbers. You know, basically improving your performance.

> 2)if you show gratitude, you're showing that person how happy, how appreciative you are.One thing we really want to stress, though, is that when you're saying this, you need to say what you are so appreciative of. So you can't just say, "I appreciate." You need to say either, "I appreciate the bonus. I appreciate your generosity" or just simply, "I appreciate it."

# 9.scale up [phr.提升规模]
>  And when you grow to scale you are trying to, you know, increase your customers. But you also need to increase like support. You need to increase… Cuz if you just grow very quickly you'll find that you won't be able to do anything.or you get really overwhelmed with all the extra work.

# 10.formalize [v.正式化] & -ize 
> 1)formalized. So this basically just means established.Established, right exactly. You need to make rules, formal rules.So this always comes with scaling up as well, you know, when you're a scrappy little startup, you know, you can really do kind of whatever you want, but when you get to be, youknow, a big company everything needs to be formalized.

# 13.jealousy [n.嫉妒] & envy [n. 羡慕；嫉妒]
> 1)So we often say that maybe jealousy is, that's the bad one.it's more negative. jealousy is afraid that someone's going to take what is yours. So if we take a relationship here for example, if you are jealous of someone and you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, you are afraid that person is going to take your person.

> 2)envy is more like wanting what someone else has.envy is just like,"Oh, Diana you know you're going on vacation again, oh..." or, you know, or like maybe "your apartment is so beautiful, you know, I really envy you".Now if you are envious of someone else's boyfriend or girlfriend, you just admire the qualities perhaps that their boyfriend or girlfriend has.

> 3) So incentivize means to motivate someone with something.Yes, gotta be with something, not, not just words

> 4)incentive:it's usually, you know, some money or something valuable.

# 15.tiered /tɪə/ [adj.阶梯式的、分层的] & tier one city [n.一线城市]
> 1)So this tiered means multilevel.So always refers to level. It doesn't matter if, if we use it as a noun, as in tier or in, as an adjective

> 2)So we say tier one, we also say first tier, right? But you still get that, that same idea of level, right, I mean, the cities at the top. The cities that are kind of going down.When I think of a tiered system, I think one of the first things I think of is the military.Because there are just so many different ranks and tiers and it takes a long time to climb all the way up to the top.

> 3)And if you are at a big company, there might be multiple tiers of management.So we all know the CEO sits at the top, and then below the CEO might be a couple of directors, and then underneath each director might be some supervising managers and then under the manager's might be some team leads.

# 16.scheme /skim/
> it is kind of like a plan or set up,or a system.when we use this word as a verb, it almost always means do something bad. They're scheming. But scheme can just be like, it just, yeah, a plan, a system, a marketing scheme. And you know, an employment scheme. Something like that.

> 3)it's a bit more abstract but you can say that someone or something to the core.Or it could be a thing like, you know, he is a politician to the core.

- The pear is rotten to the core.[这梨全烂了。]

- And that shakes me to the core.[而这一点动摇了我的内心。]

> 4) OK, non-core is non-important, unimportant roles. That's not true. These are support roles and you know they're often just as—if not more—important to the structure.

# 18.draw up [phr.起草、制定]
> 1)if you're drawing a plan, you know, like maybe you're five years old and you're making a plan for how to, you know, kidnap Santa, steal all the toys. Maybe you would, you know, you can't write at that point but you can draw, you know, you with the gun and Santa. But, yeah.

# IV.pattern 
***Hi Kate, thanks for coming in. Let's talk about your annual performance evaluation and bonus.***

***Let's start with your work. You not only put in the most overtime, but also brought in many new customers.***

***It's been a busy year. I noticed we needed extra help, so I decided to step up.***

***Thank you for being so proactive. It's been key to our success.***

***My pleasure. I'm always happy to take on more responsibility.***

***Good to hear. To show my gratitude, I've decided to give you a Chinese New Year bonus.***

***Wow, that's so generous of you! I really appreciate it.***


# V.pattern
***Zack, do you have some time to discuss the end of year bonuses?***

***That's right. We weren't really in a position to do it before. But with the help of new funding as we scale up, we need to formalize rewards and bonuses to help us retain and attract talent.***

***Absolutely. So is this something you'd like to have for people across the board or just key staff?***

***Well, I'm still on the fence. What do you think?***

***People are going to talk. We don't want to be in a situation where bonuses create jealousy.***

***I see where you're coming from. At the same time, we also want to reward top performers and incentivize others to up their game.***

***Correct. That's why I'd suggest using a tiered system. Of course, it should all be performance-based.***

***Well, we don't have performance evaluations for all the staff yet as we've just started to build a proper HR system.***

***That's alright. What we can do is formalize a bonus scheme for core roles and tie it to their performance. For roles that are non-core, it's up to you whether you want to give bonuses or just perks instead.***

***Ok, I'll think about it. How much of a bonus should we give?***

***I'd suggest starting with one month's salary for top performers since this is the first year we're doing bonuses. We can always go up in the future.***
