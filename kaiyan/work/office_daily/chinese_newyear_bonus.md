# I.4 secrets to getting a better performance evaluation
# 1. Let your manager know that you're looking forward to your evaluation.
> One reason managers worry about evaluations is that they assume they're nerve-wracking /'nɝv,rækɪŋ/ [烦恼]for employees. If you make it clear that you're looking forward to feedback, you immediately make the process more pleasant.

# 2. Evaluate yourself first. 
> List out how much progress you've made toward your goals and what you'd like to do better in the coming year. If you provide this to your manager, there's a good chance that he/she will pull directly from it when she writes her own.[会很可能从中直接引用内容]

# 3. Keep an evaluation file throughout the year. [全年都要记录好评估档案]
> Keep a file where you jot down /dʒɒt/ /daʊn/ [记录] notes on project successes during the year, so that it's helpful when you're reflecting on your performance during evaluation time. 

# 4.Ask colleagues to give feedback to your manager. 
> Think of who particularly appreciates the work you do and tell them you'd be grateful if they'd provide input to your manager. [向领导提供关于你绩效的反馈]

# II.End of year bonuses in America
> About 80% of American companies hand out bonuses [发奖金] at the end of the year to show their appreciation for employees' hard work, but how are they calculated?

> Some bosses give a fixed bonus across the board[倾向于所有人奖金都一样], which most experts advise against[不建议], as it reinforces the idea that just showing up will grant you extra money at the year's end[实际上只是在年底给所有人都多发一笔钱]. A performance-based system is usually recommended, and this will depend on how well both the company and the individual did. Usually calculated as a percentage of your base salary, it also means that the higher your salary, the more you get.

> There are those who argue against monetary incentives[金钱激励], citing studies that show financial rewards[激励方式] are not a good motivator /'məutiveitə/ for good performance[很好的改善绩效]. It could also create jealousy among employees with huge salary disparities /dɪ'spærəti/ [n.悬殊]. For example, a 30% bonus for an entry-level employee [职场新人] would only be a fraction of the bonus that a higher salaried coworker gets. [可能只有他们薪水更高的同事的一小部分]

> However, companies are beginning to realize just how important it is to retain top talent[留住顶尖人才]. Bonuses put the focus on performance[奖金关注于绩效], and allow companies to reward their most valuable employees while keeping them from having to commit to a higher base salary[防止他们要求高底薪], which is harder to maintain when the economy or the company doesn't do well[这样当经济或公司不景气的时候，公司压力会很大]. In fact, many argue that companies shouldn't only offer a lump /lʌmp/ [一块] year-end bonus [年底的时候发一次奖金] and instead implement year-round recognition through mid-year bonuses [半年奖金] as well as spot rewards for milestones /'maɪlston/  achieved [重大成就奖金] throughout the year. It makes people feel appreciated, and immediate feedback reinforces /ˌriɪn'fɔrs/ [vt.增强;加强] hard work, as well as an organization's vision[组织意识]. In turn, it increases loyalty and motivation, leading to higher employee satisfaction.

> Many Silicon Valley companies offer a minimal 15% annual salary as an end of year bonus tied to performance evaluation[和绩效挂钩]. Many also offer a sign-on bonus [签约奖金] equivalent to one month's salary [额外一个月的薪水] in order to attract top talent.[以此吸引人才]

# III.grammar
# 1.In a position to do something
>  When you aren't in a position to do something, you are either unable to do it or don't have the authority to.

- 1. I really wish I could help, but I'm not in a position to work on marketing campaigns.[没有资格处理市场活动这块的工作]

- 2. My wife and I are lucky to be in a position [有条件] to send our daughter to an international school. 

- 3. Once I switched to my new job, I was in a position to travel more often.[有机会]

# 2.evaluation [n.评价]
> 1)so an evaluation is just a review. It's looking back at someone's work over the year. So they take kind of information like, how much overtime [n.加班时间] they did, how much money they earn for the company, and then they use that as their evaluation to determine whether they'll get a promotion or a bonus.

> 2)we can evaluate other things besides employees, right? Maybe you don't know what school you're gonna go to, so you say, "I need to evaluate my options."

# 3.bonus /'bonəs/ [pl.bonuses]
> 1)So, "a bonus" is just money that you usually get at the end of the year, and it's money added to your salary. So, it's kind of like extra salary.

> 2)A bonus can also just be something good, right?Sure, exactly. Sometimes when I hear really good news, I just say, "Oh, bonus."

# 4.put in sth & put sth in  [phr.投入]
> 1)That's to kinda spend some extra time or effort to do something.it's usually time and effort. You put in time. You put in effort and then the result is well, in this case, it was a bonus, but it could be other good things too.

> 2)sometimes when we use "put in," we separate this phrasal verb as well.Yeah, this one you can separate, so you can "put time in" or "put in time." It's fine.

# 5.bring in [v.带来、引入]
> we often talk about bringing in sales, bringing in revenue. There is lots of things that you can bring in that a company or a boss would find super valuable.So Kate must've gone out, found some new customers and attracted them to the company. But it's not only customers that you can bring into a company. You can also bring in money.

# 6.step up [phr.在需要时采取行动] & take on [phr.承担] & put sb on sth.
> 1）"step up" just really means to put in that extra effort to take on more responsibility.I'm sure everyone knows someone like that at a company, or maybe you're that person at your company. Maybe you step up when people need help or something needs to be done. we often hear a line like, "oh, we were falling behind, so I had to step up." Or, "I stepped up because no one else was doing anything."

> 2)So "take on" is another phrasal verb that we always use at work. And it, basically, just means "start doing more things" or "be responsible for more things."Or maybe you have a second job, so you can say, "Hey, I had to take on a second job to make some more money."

> 3)So, here she is more "being put on" these bigger projects. So, her boss's kind of giving it to her, right? So usually, when we're taking things on, we're doing it because we want to. We're doing it because it's our choice. And usually, when we are put on something, it's because it's someone else's choice.

# 7.proactive /ˌpro'æktɪv/  [adj.积极主动地] & reactive /rɪ'æktɪv/
> 1)It's good to be proactive, and basically, if you're proactive, you make things happen. You don't wait for something to happen, and then you do something. You're kind of like ahead of everything,?when you're being proactive, yeah, you're... you're out there. You're not waiting for anybody. You're getting stuff done.

> 2)because when you wait for things to happen to you, that's called being reactive. You're reacting to things.

- you also have processes that become reactive to news cycles.[你也会有一个对新的想法和环境反应的一个过程。]

- But because you're training yourself to be reactive, right?[因为你在让自己受到影响。对吧?]

# 8.gratitude [n.] & grateful [adj.] & appreciate 
> 1)so gratitude has a close relative, which is "grateful." You can say, "I am grateful," "she is grateful," "we are all grateful." But the noun "gratitude," like Johnny says, we usually show it or express it.

> 2)if you show gratitude, you're showing that person how happy, how appreciative you are.One thing we really want to stress, though, is that when you're saying this, you need to say what you are so appreciative of. So you can't just say, "I appreciate." You need to say either, "I appreciate the bonus. I appreciate your generosity" or just simply, "I appreciate it."

# IV.pattern 
***Hi Kate, thanks for coming in. Let's talk about your annual performance evaluation and bonus.***

***Let's start with your work. You not only put in the most overtime, but also brought in many new customers.***

***It's been a busy year. I noticed we needed extra help, so I decided to step up.***

***Thank you for being so proactive. It's been key to our success.***

***My pleasure. I'm always happy to take on more responsibility.***

***Good to hear. To show my gratitude, I've decided to give you a Chinese New Year bonus.***

***Wow, that's so generous of you! I really appreciate it.***


# V.pattern
***Zack, do you have some time to discuss the end of year bonuses?***

***That's right. We weren't really in a position to do it before. But with the help of new funding as we scale up, we need to formalize rewards and bonuses to help us retain and attract talent.***

***Absolutely. So is this something you'd like to have for people across the board or just key staff?***

***Well, I'm still on the fence. What do you think?***

***People are going to talk. We don't want to be in a situation where bonuses create jealousy.***

***I see where you're coming from. At the same time, we also want to reward top performers and incentivize others to up their game.***

***Correct. That's why I'd suggest using a tiered system. Of course, it should all be performance-based.***

***Well, we don't have performance evaluations for all the staff yet as we've just started to build a proper HR system.***

***That's alright. What we can do is formalize a bonus scheme for core roles and tie it to their performance. For roles that are non-core, it's up to you whether you want to give bonuses or just perks instead.***

***Ok, I'll think about it. How much of a bonus should we give?***

***I'd suggest starting with one month's salary for top performers since this is the first year we're doing bonuses. We can always go up in the future.***
