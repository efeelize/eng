***Colin, thanks for your time today. I would like to thank you for being one of our best customers over the past year. Have you looked over the service agreement I emailed earlier?***

***Thanks for coming in Josh. Yeah, it seems to be the same agreement we signed last year, only your rates have gone up. I really need a good reason to justify the cost increase to management.***

***I can relate. In this economy, we have to make the best use of our resources. But let me assure you that renewing your contract with us will be money well spent. First of all, our IT team is available for customer support around the clock to give you immediate assistance. I hope your experience with us in the past year has confirmed the quality and speed of our service. We have an excellent record of providing 24/7 professional service.***

***Yes, we’ve been impressed by the reliability of your service. But I’m not sure that we need such a comprehensive package in light of last year’s usage. We didn’t use a lot of the services you provided and I am wondering if we should downgrade to a more basic package.***

***Colin, I see where you’re coming from. But renewing the existing package would be the best for you considering that it gives you a dedicated account manager who has developed a deep knowledge of your business and it gives you 24/7 tech support. The cheaper package wouldn’t offer you the same kind of support.***

***Well, I would have no problem renewing the contract at the same price. But the price increase is really causing me to consider downgrading or switching service providers.***

***Colin, let me ask you, were you satisfied with the service we provided in the past year?***

***Oh yeah, no complaints about the service. Price is the main issue here.***

***Well, I’m glad to hear that you are happy with our service. And I would like to add that we’re constantly improving our service. For example, we brought in more technicians and upgraded our hardware last year to provide higher quality service. That’s why we’ve increased the price by a small percentage. We really believe that this will allow us to provide better service to our clients.***

***Josh, I understand. But the new price is over our budget. That’s why I suggest we look at a more basic offering or you guys give us a renewal discount.***

***Colin, I believe we’ve had a successful working relationship and we would like to keep working with your firm. My suggestion is that the current plan is by far the best for you. Although we don’t offer renewal discounts, I could look at giving you additional services for free.***

***How about I give you extra 20 hours of tech consulting? In your current contract, any consulting is billed on an hourly basis. That’s worth $4000 dollars. But I am happy to give it to you for free. I believe your firm will benefit from it as you’re upgrading your tech platform.***

***Well, we were budgeting for at least 30 hours of tech consulting this year anyway. Let’s do that.***
