# I.grammar
# 1.only [conj.]
> So here we have the world "only" and it means something a little different from what it usually means.it means "except that your rates have gone up".Yeah, it seems to be the same agreement we signed last year, only your rates have gone up. (是啊，这看起来 就和我们去年签署的协议一样，只是你们的价格涨了。)[only的意思是“但是”。这样的提出异议的方式更加自然。]

# 2.service agreement [n.服务协议]

# 3.justify [vt. 证明…有理]
> so "justify" here means "to convince me of something, to convince me that I should pay more for this service". so "to justify the cost increase to management" means "to explain to management why the cost has gone up and there's a good reason".

# 4.money well spent 
> Yeah, "money well spent" is a pretty common expression. For example, insurance, You know, you need insurance, health insurance so it's money well spent.So then the sales rep[代表（representative）] tells him that renewing his contract will be money well spent. So what are some other ways that we can use this phrase "money well spent".Yes, and how about the gym? Gym membership is money well spent.

# 5.around the clock [adj.全天候的]
> So, this means it's pretty much 24/7, it's available all the time.Yeah, any time of the day, you can contact support so that's around the clock service, 24/7 service and he talks about how the company has an excellent record of providing 24/7 professional service.

# 6.excellent record 
> so "excellent" record here means excellent history, a spotless history, a spotless record.Yeah, they've been doing a great job. 

# 7. comprehensive package & comprehensive & comprehensive exam [综合考试] & comprehensive insurance 
> 1)the comprehensive package means it's very complete, it has a lot of stuff in it, so it's also expensive.And the client admits that the service is good, it's very reliable but he says that he doesn't think they need such a comprehensive package in light of last year's usage /'jusɪdʒ/ [n.惯例].so they don't need a huge package, a premium /'primɪəm/ [n.保险费、额外的费用] package with lots of features /fitʃɚ/ [n.特色] and services, they don't need something like that.

> 2)So comprehensive is kind of like more in depth.Yeah, like in depth, full, complete, right?
Right. So it's cool to be a programmer. You get to do lots of things. But when you're the product manager, your role is much bigger, much fuller, much more in depth, like we said.

# 9.downgrade [v.降低] & upgrade 
> 1) "downgrade" means "to go from a higher, more expensive level of service to a simpler, cheaper level of service"Yeah, the basic package which is not a comprehensive package, it's a limited package.Yeah, it's limited to only the most important services.Yeah, the basic package which is not a comprehensive package, it's a limited package.Yeah, it's limited to only the most important services.so "downgrading" means "using a basic package instead of a comprehensive package" .

# 10.switching [v.转换] & make the switch & transition [n.转型]

> 1) "switching service providers" just means "finding a different IT service company".So the sales rep tells him that they are constantly improving their service, an example that he gives is that they brought in more technicians and upgraded their hardware.Yes, so technicians are usually people that fix the hardware. Those kinds of IT issues, they're not programmers, they deal with the hardware.

> 2) It just means change. so it's kind of a collocation  /'kɑlə'keʃən/ [n.搭配] here, a chunk. And it doesn't have to be a job that could be like a hobby. Like when I was in middle school, I made the switch from skiing to snowboarding /'snobɔrd/ [n.滑雪].

> 3)make "the "switch:the "the" basically is pointing to something very important. Like, for example, Connor and I are both using max, an Apple computers, but my whole life I've always used PCs, so I made the switch. A couple years ago, it's a big important switch.

> 4)But let me think about "switch". We should be thinking about like light switches. It's on, or its off, it's this, or it's that, or as a transition kind of, kind of implies going between.there's some area between, when it's not quite finished changing.

> 4.1)Like a lot of companies, I'm sure when they want to change their systems, they wish they could just switch very easily. But, yeah, sometimes these, these transitions, we'd even say it like, even this transitional period, it's sometimes very difficult.

> 4.2)You know, when I was a kid, software was something that you bought in a box.And you took it home, and it was yours.On your computer. And then, over time, we made this transition into software as a service, cloud computing.

# II.pattern
***Colin, thanks for your time today. I would like to thank you for being one of our best customers over the past year. Have you looked over the service agreement I emailed earlier?***

***Thanks for coming in Josh. Yeah, it seems to be the same agreement we signed last year, only your rates have gone up. I really need a good reason to justify the cost increase to management.***

***I can relate. In this economy, we have to make the best use of our resources. But let me assure you that renewing your contract with us will be money well spent. First of all, our IT team is available for customer support around the clock to give you immediate assistance. I hope your experience with us in the past year has confirmed the quality and speed of our service. We have an excellent record of providing 24/7 professional service.***

***Yes, we’ve been impressed by the reliability of your service. But I’m not sure that we need such a comprehensive package in light of last year’s usage. We didn’t use a lot of the services you provided and I am wondering if we should downgrade to a more basic package.***

***Colin, I see where you’re coming from. But renewing the existing package would be the best for you considering that it gives you a dedicated account manager who has developed a deep knowledge of your business and it gives you 24/7 tech support. The cheaper package wouldn’t offer you the same kind of support.***

***Well, I would have no problem renewing the contract at the same price. But the price increase is really causing me to consider downgrading or switching service providers.***

***Colin, let me ask you, were you satisfied with the service we provided in the past year?***

***Oh yeah, no complaints about the service. Price is the main issue here.***

***Well, I’m glad to hear that you are happy with our service. And I would like to add that we’re constantly improving our service. For example, we brought in more technicians and upgraded our hardware last year to provide higher quality service. That’s why we’ve increased the price by a small percentage. We really believe that this will allow us to provide better service to our clients.***

***Josh, I understand. But the new price is over our budget. That’s why I suggest we look at a more basic offering or you guys give us a renewal discount.***

***Colin, I believe we’ve had a successful working relationship and we would like to keep working with your firm. My suggestion is that the current plan is by far the best for you. Although we don’t offer renewal discounts, I could look at giving you additional services for free.***

***How about I give you extra 20 hours of tech consulting? In your current contract, any consulting is billed on an hourly basis. That’s worth $4000 dollars. But I am happy to give it to you for free. I believe your firm will benefit from it as you’re upgrading your tech platform.***

***Well, we were budgeting for at least 30 hours of tech consulting this year anyway. Let’s do that.***
