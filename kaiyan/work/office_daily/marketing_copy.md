# 1.namely
> “Namely” is an adverb that means “to be specific” or “that is to say”. In this way, its use is interchangeable with that of “specifically”. That said, “namely”has a slightly more formal connotation and is of a higher linguistic register than “specifically”. Integrating the use of “namely” into your English is an easy way to make your English sound more developed and nuanced.

***Thanks for sending over your rough draft of the marketing copy for the new campaign. I looked it over and wanted to discuss it with you.***

***Rough draft...? What I sent was the final draft.***

***Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. It was really well-written and structured, but stylistically it misses the mark.***

***How so?***

***It seems to me that you wrote it from the perspective of traditional copy, but as an e-commerce company we need copy that's optimized for the internet.***

***Is there a difference?***

***Definitely. People digest the internet differently from print, namely that their attention spans are shorter.More than anything, it needs to be succinct.***

***Gotcha. What about the content itself?***

***It's great. It's clear you have a knack for story-telling. I would say the narrative feels a bit weak by the end,though. And the call to action didn't really leave much an impression with me.***

***I see.***

***It's important that we keep the tone really punchy all the way to the end, and that the call to action is clearer and more definitive - trying to read it as the consumer, I can see how they might be confused about where they should go to sign up for our product.***

***OK, I'll get on top of re-working that.***

***One last thing - the title is good, but I think it could be a little bit more magnetic and SEO optimized. It needs to be short and sweet but also not generic - most internet copy is pretty much the same these days, so something that sets it apart in a unique way.***

***A tall order, but I'll get working on it and present you with another version by Thursday. Thanks for the feedback.***
