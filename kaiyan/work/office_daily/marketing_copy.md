# marketing_copy
# I.marketing campagin.
> Marketing has undergone a renaissance of sorts since the full maturing of the internet. While internet marketing involves many of the same skillsets as traditional marketing, there are key differences in tone and approach. These differences include an awareness of how individuals interact with digital media vs print media and the exigencies of search engine optimization. As such, digital marketing is still in a process of selfdefinition and exploration, both in the United States and globally.

# II.grammar
# 1.namely
> “Namely” is an adverb that means “to be specific” or “that is to say”. In this way, its use is interchangeable with that of “specifically”. That said, “namely”has a slightly more formal connotation and is of a higher linguistic register than “specifically”. Integrating the use of “namely” into your English is an easy way to make your English sound more developed and nuanced.

# III.pattern
***Thanks for sending over your rough draft of the marketing copy for the new campaign. I looked it over and wanted to discuss it with you.***

***Rough draft...? What I sent was the final draft.***

***Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. It was really well-written and structured, but stylistically it misses the mark.***

***How so?***

***It seems to me that you wrote it from the perspective of traditional copy, but as an e-commerce company we need copy that's optimized for the internet.***

***Is there a difference?***

***Definitely. People digest the internet differently from print, namely that their attention spans are shorter.More than anything, it needs to be succinct.***

***Gotcha. What about the content itself?***

***It's great. It's clear you have a knack for story-telling. I would say the narrative feels a bit weak by the end,though. And the call to action didn't really leave much an impression with me.***

***I see.***

***It's important that we keep the tone really punchy all the way to the end, and that the call to action is clearer and more definitive - trying to read it as the consumer, I can see how they might be confused about where they should go to sign up for our product.***

***OK, I'll get on top of re-working that.***

***One last thing - the title is good, but I think it could be a little bit more magnetic and SEO optimized. It needs to be short and sweet but also not generic - most internet copy is pretty much the same these days, so something that sets it apart in a unique way.***

***A tall order, but I'll get working on it and present you with another version by Thursday. Thanks for the feedback.***
