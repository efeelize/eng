# I.Advantages Of Outsourcing
# 1.You Don’t Have To Hire More Employees 
> When you outsource, you can pay your help as a contractor[n.承包人]. This allows you to avoid bringing an employee into the company, which saves you money on everything from benefits to training.

# 2.Access To A Larger Talent Pool 
> When hiring an employee, you may only have access to a small, local talent pool. This often means you have to compromise. Many companies have found that outsourcing gives them access to talent in other parts of the world. If you need specialized help, it often makes sense to expand your search.

# 3.Lower Labor Cost 
> You don’t want to trade quality for price, but outsourcing often allows you to get the best of both worlds. By searching a global talent pool, it’s easier to find the right talent at the right price.

# II.Cons Of Outsourcing 
# 1. Lack Of Control 
> Although you can provide direction in regard to what you need to accomplish, you give up some control when you outsource.

# 4.outsource
> So when a small company starts to get bigger, it's really hard to deal with HR, cause it's complicated.Right, so this has become very common, all big companies do this, they outsource their internal activities to some outside company, that's really good at it.Exactly, so this often happens, let's say, with film, because there are a lot of special effects, so sometimes the film company will actually outsource the special effects.Yeah, exactly. There's lots of companies that do outsourcing, like you mentioned film and gaming, in this case HR, there could be legal companies.

# 5.that's where sth comes [phr.这就是能用到...的地方]

> 2) It just means change. so it's kind of a collocation  /'kɑlə'keʃən/ [n.搭配] here, a chunk. And it doesn't have to be a job that could be like a hobby. Like when I was in middle school, I made the switch from skiing to snowboarding /'snobɔrd/ [n.滑雪].

> 3)make "the "switch:the "the" basically is pointing to something very important. Like, for example, Connor and I are both using max, an Apple computers, but my whole life I've always used PCs, so I made the switch. A couple years ago, it's a big important switch.

> 4)But let me think about "switch". We should be thinking about like light switches. It's on, or its off, it's this, or it's that, or as a transition kind of, kind of implies going between.there's some area between, when it's not quite finished changing.

> 4.1)Like a lot of companies, I'm sure when they want to change their systems, they wish they could just switch very easily. But, yeah, sometimes these, these transitions, we'd even say it like, even this transitional period, it's sometimes very difficult.

> 4.2)You know, when I was a kid, software was something that you bought in a box.And you took it home, and it was yours.On your computer. And then, over time, we made this transition into software as a service, cloud computing.

# IV.pattern
***Hi, Paul. It's nice to finally speak with you on the phone.***

***Nice to speak with you as well. So, as you mentioned, you're looking for a vendor to outsource your HR and would like to know more about our services?***

***That's right. Our business is getting too big to handle that alone.***

***Well, that's where a company like ours comes in. We specialize in end-to-end payroll managing, benefits and staff onboarding.***

***That's exactly what we're looking for. Could you give me an idea as to your current client base?***

***We specialize in small-to-medium sized businesses. Our clients usually have a headcount between 20 and 200. We're actually the leading vendor for this segment. And most of them come from word of mouth.***

***Okay, that sounds great. How do you charge for your services?***

***We charge per employee, and it's a tiered structure, meaning the more employees, the greater the discount.***

***That sounds great. We currently have around 80 employees. Could I get a quote?***

***For sure. I'll do it right away.***

# IV.pattern
***Jake, thank you for coming. Since your contract is almost up, I want to talk to you about renewing it.***

***Ok, let’s talk.***

***I know you’ve expressed interest in staying with us and we’d love to have you here as well. So I’d just like to hear your opinion on the matter.***

***Well, I am really happy here and I would love to stay longer. But I would like to see what the company is proposing for me if I stay here.***

***Since you’ve been with us for one year, we think it’s time we give you more responsibilities.***

***Will these responsibilities come with a raise?***

***Unfortunately, we are trying to control costs and we can’t offer you a raise at the time.***

***But more responsibilities usually include a raise, especially if I’m re-signing for another year.***

***Well besides the additional work you’ll be carrying out, why else do you believe you deserve a raise?***

***Well, I have done a lot of hard work in the past year. I usually help out others who are running late on deadlines. I also meet my deadlines and try to participate in as many company workshops and events as possible.***

***Well you are right about most of these points, but there is always room for improvement. I have had a few complaints from some of your clients and I believe you can step it up a notch when it comes to working with them.***

***Look, Jake, as I mentioned before we are trying to control cost here. The market is at the same level it was when you joined the company; if it had changed we might have more of an ability to give you a raise. I believe we are investing in you by giving you more learning opportunities and a chance for developing some new skills.***

***I understand where you are coming from, but I already have an offer with another company. I’m being offered the same job for more money. I would much rather work here, but I was hoping my performance and loyalty could get some recognition.***

***Ok, I can’t offer you a raise, but I can offer you something different. How about a performance-based bonus? I’ll think of some metrics for bettering your client-service skills. We can come up with an incentive plan for reaching those goals, including bonuses as a reward.***

***Ok, that’s something I’d consider.***

# VI.pattern
***Colin, thanks for your time today. I would like to thank you for being one of our best customers over the past year. Have you looked over the service agreement I emailed earlier?***

***Thanks for coming in Josh. Yeah, it seems to be the same agreement we signed last year, only your rates have gone up. I really need a good reason to justify the cost increase to management.***

***I can relate. In this economy, we have to make the best use of our resources. But let me assure you that renewing your contract with us will be money well spent. First of all, our IT team is available for customer support around the clock to give you immediate assistance. I hope your experience with us in the past year has confirmed the quality and speed of our service. We have an excellent record of providing 24/7 professional service.***

***Yes, we’ve been impressed by the reliability of your service. But I’m not sure that we need such a comprehensive package in light of last year’s usage. We didn’t use a lot of the services you provided and I am wondering if we should downgrade to a more basic package.***

***Colin, I see where you’re coming from. But renewing the existing package would be the best for you considering that it gives you a dedicated account manager who has developed a deep knowledge of your business and it gives you 24/7 tech support. The cheaper package wouldn’t offer you the same kind of support.***

***Well, I would have no problem renewing the contract at the same price. But the price increase is really causing me to consider downgrading or switching service providers.***

***Colin, let me ask you, were you satisfied with the service we provided in the past year?***

***Oh yeah, no complaints about the service. Price is the main issue here.***

***Well, I’m glad to hear that you are happy with our service. And I would like to add that we’re constantly improving our service. For example, we brought in more technicians and upgraded our hardware last year to provide higher quality service. That’s why we’ve increased the price by a small percentage. We really believe that this will allow us to provide better service to our clients.***

***Josh, I understand. But the new price is over our budget. That’s why I suggest we look at a more basic offering or you guys give us a renewal discount.***

***Colin, I believe we’ve had a successful working relationship and we would like to keep working with your firm. My suggestion is that the current plan is by far the best for you. Although we don’t offer renewal discounts, I could look at giving you additional services for free.***

***How about I give you extra 20 hours of tech consulting? In your current contract, any consulting is billed on an hourly basis. That’s worth $4000 dollars. But I am happy to give it to you for free. I believe your firm will benefit from it as you’re upgrading your tech platform.***

***Well, we were budgeting for at least 30 hours of tech consulting this year anyway. Let’s do that.***
