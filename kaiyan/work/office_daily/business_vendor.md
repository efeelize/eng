# Looking for business vendor

# I.Advantages Of Outsourcing
# 1.You Don’t Have To Hire More Employees 
> When you outsource, you can pay your help as a contractor[n.承包人]. This allows you to avoid bringing an employee into the company, which saves you money on everything from benefits to training.

# 2.Access To A Larger Talent Pool 
> When hiring an employee, you may only have access to a small, local talent pool. This often means you have to compromise. Many companies have found that outsourcing gives them access to talent in other parts of the world. If you need specialized help, it often makes sense to expand your search.

# 3.Lower Labor Cost 
> You don’t want to trade quality for price, but outsourcing often allows you to get the best of both worlds. By searching a global talent pool, it’s easier to find the right talent at the right price.

# II.Cons Of Outsourcing 
# 1. Lack Of Control 
> Although you can provide direction in regard to what you need to accomplish, you give up some control when you outsource.

# 2.Communication Issues 
> This doesn’t always come into play, but it’s one of the biggest potential drawbacks.

# III.grammar
# 1.as to & in regarding to 
> The phrase “as to” is another way of saying “regarding” or “relating to”. When used to introduce or refer to an issue or topic, it is similar to “about” but is more formal.

- As to your vacation time,HR will get in touch with you to discuss that.
- I'm just not certain as to which option will be best for me.
- We're considering a variety of strategies as to this matter.

# 2.vendor
> 1)Vendor, when I think of vendor is like a person selling something like food on the street.so often a vendor is the person that is in this kind of booth, you can have a newspaper vendor or you could have an ice cream vendor.Yeah, Yeah, exactly, all different types of vendors.and here we actually have a vendor that is selling a service.

> 2)But vendor can also be like a big company that sells some kind of supplies or products.

# 3.HR [human resources]
> and this is the department that deals with the hiring and the training.Right, of all of the staff, if employees ever have a question about something in their company, they can talk to HR.Yeah, and just as you said, you said HR, you can say human resources but most of the time we just keep it short.

# 4.outsource
> So when a small company starts to get bigger, it's really hard to deal with HR, cause it's complicated.Right, so this has become very common, all big companies do this, they outsource their internal activities to some outside company, that's really good at it.Exactly, so this often happens, let's say, with film, because there are a lot of special effects, so sometimes the film company will actually outsource the special effects.Yeah, exactly. There's lots of companies that do outsourcing, like you mentioned film and gaming, in this case HR, there could be legal companies.

# 5.that's where sth comes [phr.这就是能用到...的地方]
> so it just means that this is the situation where this type of person would be useful.Uhuh, useful or needed, yeah, like those big bank heist movies, every person has a special role to play in robbing the bank. You've got like the hacker, all these other guys they...they come in at a certain stage.So maybe you need someone to drop into a building, right? There's a special guy for that.

# 6.end-to-end [adj.全程的，从头到尾的]
> So that just means it includes everything.Yeah, end-to-end solution, you know, it has all of the answers in our end-to-end system or like a computer program that includes every part of that, could be payroll in this case.

# 7.payroll managing [n.薪酬管理] & management 
> 1)payroll, that's a list of employees that get paid by the company.so often when you are hired, they need to get you on payroll.you don't want to be off the payroll.

> 2)so managing just means that you're keeping everything organized and you're kind of dealing with all the tasks.

> 3)Here managing does not mean management, right?Exactly, management, that is your group of bosses.

# 8.benefits
> We know benefit is something good, right?And often these are your bonuses as well as your vacation and any kind of sick leave.Any good extra things you get like healthcare, right?Yeah, or dental /'dɛntl/  care.Or sometimes you even get a company car, that's a nice little benefit.

# 9.staff onboarding [n.员工入职]
> Onboarding is basically training.Yeah. It's specifically for new employees.Exactly, after onboarding, they just call it training.You're getting used to how to do your job and all of the company policy, and all the company systems, that kind of stuff.Yep, or helping you to get to know those products.For sure, and it sounds like that's exactly what Amber's looking for, but she has another question here.

# 10.client base & customer base & fanbase
> 1)It is your group of clients or customers.Yeah, your regular ones.but we want to show that they are important, so we're gonna say client base instead.

> 2)Yeah, at a restaurant, we wouldn't really say client base, we would say customer base, so we've got client base, customer base, and maybe even fanbase.

> 3)fanbase is normally a group of people that are a fan of something, often they're pretty young.But you could also have older fanbase as well, right? The film Star Wars's fanbase.

# 11.headcount [n.职员人数]
> Those just mean how many people.this word headcount. I remember this from when I was in elementary school.Yeah, because when you are on a field trip, they always need to do a headcount.You're counting how many people, how many heads.Yeah,right. And that is kind of important especially with children.

# 12.targeting segment [n.领域、部分]
> so segment means like a part or a divided group, but in this case we're talking about a market segment.Exactly, so that is kind of like their target group, would you say?Well, they're targeting a segment.That's sure. So they could be a group of people that are a similar age, gender or maybe they're living in the same area.Yeah, so when you have a company, you need to target a specific segment, you can't just mark it to everybody.

# 13.word of mouth [n.口碑]
> 1）word of mouth. This is a great expression, it just means here like from a friend or somebody you know.Exactly, and this is often how news spreads, right? It spreads by word of mouth.Well. I mean on Facebook and some of those things they spread by social media.

> 2)But what is something else that often spreads by word of mouth?Rumors.Yes, those spread extremely quickly by word of mouth.

# 14.tiered structure  /tɪə/ &  pyramid /'pɪrəmɪd/ & top tier
> 1)tier means level.so you can kind of think of this as a pyramid.So what this means is when they have many employees, they reached a new level, and at that level they get a greater discount.a tiered cake, it has levels, it's a really expensive, very fancy wedding cake.

> 2)top tier: that's an expression we use like a top tier athlete.Or could you say a top tier professional.

# 15.quote
> A quote. So she wants to know how much he's going to pay before she buys it.Estimate, yeah. So that will just tell you, well, if you purchase our product, this is how much you have to pay.Yeah, and frequently, you can ask for a quote at like any kind of repair shop, too.Yeah, for bigger things, if you need to get your house repaired, your car repaired, those big things.

# 16.right away & right now
> But it's a little bit different from right now, because right now we can only use this in the present tense.Yeah. I couldn't say:" Oh, yesterday, I did it right now", that doesn't make sense.No, but you could say yesterday I did it right away.s
