***James, you've had a mentor right?***

***Yes. Why do you ask?***

***Well, I've recently read a lot about the importance of finding a career mentor. I’m feeling a bit stagnant at work and could really use some advice. But I don't know how mentoring works or how to even find one.***

***Well the first thing you need to keep in mind is that mentoring is a two-way relationship[双向关系]. Your mentor also has to be getting something out of it[你的导师也要从中有所收获]. Although, it is flattering to have your opinion valued[能被你看重作为导师是很受宠若惊], not everyone has the time to give an hour of free advice.***

***Most people, especially someone you’d consider a mentor, are swamped with various projects or assignments[要事缠身]; and taking on a mentee can be more of a burden than a reward. You may get turned down[失望], but that doesn’t mean you should give up; some people just have very limited time.***

***I’d love to run a company someday, so do you think it would be a good idea to ask the CEO?***

***Don’t think that you can just go into the CEO’s office and ask him or her to be your mentor. You should be a little more acquainted with the person.[你应该和对方相互再熟一点]***

***So whom should I ask?***

***Ask a manager, director[总监] or someone in a senior position at your company. I advise thinking of a few reasons why he or she is someone you look up to. You can say something like, “You have a real aptitude for problem solving.[你有很高的解决问题的资质]”***

***What if I am interested in someone who doesn’t work with me? How could I approach them?***

***Well, you could cold call your potential mentor. This could really impress your mentor, since it’ll show that you’re somewhat audacious[因为你的大胆对你印象深刻]. Having the guts to bravely cold call a person you admire is definitely an entrepreneurial skill[有胆量直接打电话给陌生人绝对是个企业家才有的技能]. Making an appearance in person [亲自拜访] can also impress your mentor.***

***Remember to be amiable [温和亲善] in these situations. Even if your potential mentor says no, they may decide to contact you later—like when they’re less busy. Remember you need to look for someone of high caliber, who is a plausible candidate and has experience in the things you want to do.***

***Thanks a bunch for the advice![金玉良言]***
