# Hypothetical_questions

# I.How to answer hypothetical interview questions?
> Hypothetical interview questions can be some of the most challenging questions to answer [最难回答] as they can vary widely[因为它们差异很大、各不相同]. However, these types of questions are important for employers to see how you think on your feet[考察你随机应变的能力], as well as get an accurate sense of how you would approach [处理] regular work situations that may occur in your day-to-day life.Common techniques to answer hypothetical questions.

# 1.Pause, reflect and clarify.
> Take a moment to process the question [思考一下问题] before transitioning into the answer mode[回答之前]. This shows the interviewer you are being thoughtful [深思熟虑] and deeply reflecting on the question.

# 2.Externalize /ɪkˈstɚnəˌlaɪz/ [使具体化] your thinking.
> It is significantly more important to show HOW you work through the question rather than WHAT your answer is.

# 3.Structure along big themes.[理清大的主题]
> Grouping ideas into themes [将你的想法按主题分组] will make it easier for the interviewer to follow your thinking. It is also significant to reflect on why those themes are important.

# 4.Integrate [融入] actual experiences.
> While the situation is hypothetical, to make your answers compelling[令人信服], you can weave [融进] your actual experiences into the answer to show your approach is proven and authentic.[以表明你所说的方法是经过验证、切实可行的。]

# II.grammar 
# 1.All the while
> 1)"during the entire time"[同时]:Josh says that he would do one thing, all the while being prepared to do another.

> 2) But often this phrase is used to talk about more extended periods of time, like days, months, or even years.

- 1. You don’t like any sports? All the while, I thought you were a soccer fan! [你不喜欢运动吗?我一直以为你是个足球迷。]

> 3)Also, we use "all the while" to talk about some kind of surprise or change.  it was actually some other way. That is why you’ll often see it used when someone is betrayed.

- 2. He was my most trusted advisor, yet all the while, he was planning to betray me. [他是我最信任的顾问，原来他一直计划着背叛我。]

# 2.hypo- & hypothetical [adj.假设的] & hypothetically [adv.] hypocritical [adj.虚伪的]
> 1）it really just means unreal and imaginary.Right, exactly. I mean the purpose of a hypothetical is to either practice thinking or to reveal what you would do in a situation like that.

> 2)And it is interesting because here it's an adjective, but we've been using it as a noun.Like, you can say hypothetical questions, situations. But you also can just say "hypothetical" or "hypotheticals".Yeah, I'll give you a hypothetical.

> 3)And so when we're speaking hypothetically, we use the subjunctive mood[虚拟语气].Yeah, and so we end up using the "would" or "could", modal verb.

- In this hyoithetical scenario,how do you think you and your team would respond?

- Hypothetically speaking,how much would a job like the one you are offering pay.[假设来说，像你现在提供的这种工作工资是多少]

- It's just a hypothetical question.There's no need to get so angry about it!

# 3.inclineed [adj.倾向的]
> you tend to do this, you're likely to this.Like "incline", the noun means like a slope, like when you're riding down a hill, you're probably going to go down the hill.

# 4.multi-pronged [adj.多方面的] 
> 1)So prong is something that you see at the end of fork.Sometimes you might call it a time, too.Yeah, they're pretty much interchangeable. The point is that it's either the thing that you use to pick up the food or if it's on a weapon, it's the thing you use to kill your enemies.The pointy part.

> 2)But, of course, forks and other weapons, other tools, they don't just have 1 prong, it's not a very useful tool. They usually have many prongs.

# 5.done all of my homework [phr.做好所有准备工作]
> So we used this expression a lot, it just means prepared.Yeah, you just read all of the material, you have taken in all of the information that you can.Yeah. And generally it's for things like meetings or interviews or meeting somebody new or you need to read up on that person or that company.

# 6.sensible
> So we got this word here, "sensible". We can use it in so many different ways like, like sensible approach, like in politics, sensible policy.

# 7.trade-offs [n.平衡、利弊] & budge /bʌdʒ/  [v.让步、服从] & shy away [phr.逃避]
> 1）The trade-off here is, it's a great word. It's a noun, it comes from a phrasal verb. Here it's a noun, it basically means, you know, there's gonna be some good things, there's gonna be some bad things. You kind of need to compromise.Because when you trade something, you lose something basically.But generally speaking, every situation has, you know, a good part or aspect and a bad part, and you need to find that perfect balance.I guess one huge trade-off for people in the modern world is a lot of people work in the city, but you know, maybe they don't want to live in the city, maybe can't afford to live in this city. So you could live very far away and of course your living costs would be so much lower, but the trade-off is you have to commute for 2 hours.

> 2)Oh man, this guy just won't budge.Yeah. So it could be, because somebody's stubborn.

> 3)Because we use it a lot for, like if the door is stuck, we could say, it won't budge.Yeah, or a really heavy couch or sofa, trying to push it, but it just won't budge.

> 4)So you can see "shy" here and that's kind of the sense of the word when you see a challenge. To shy away means that you avoid it, you get scared of it.You could be scared of it, you could just be lazy. Challenge, why would I want to challenge?

# 8.all the while [phr.一直，始终] & concrete [adj.实质上，具体的]
>  "Concrete", we do bring up a lot because it's really important that you guys use this word. Of course when we're speaking hypothetically, we're kind of dealing with abstract things? But the whole reason we're asking these kinds of questions is to find out what someone would do in a concrete situation.Yeah. Give a clear tangible answer.

# 9.contained [adj.可控的] & controlled 
> Contained, yeah. Like the design from nothing from the outside can get in contamination /kənˌtæməˈneʃən/ [n.污染].It's 90% negative, it's almost always negative. It can kind of be neutral, I guess, too, very rarely positive.You should say that because we do often use "contained" in the sense of like controlled. The disease or some other social problems and people need to contain it. So if you say: oh, you know, the problem has been contained, it's basically the same thing as saying that it's under control.

# 10.proof of concept [n.概念验证]
> I mean, an experiment really should be to proof something, right? So a proof of concept, this is a great word in business, just means that: wow, here you go, here's proof.Yeah. Here's an example of what I want to do. It's the first one, it's probably going to be pretty rough around the edges, right?That's a good point. But that's the kind of thing that you need in order to get either permission, or maybe funding to make the next experiment or the next stage.Right, you can't just say I'm gonna do this, I want to do that. You have to show it's already been done a little bit at least.

# 11.uphill battles [phr.艰苦的奋斗] & pick your battles.[phr.选择你的斗争] & battlefield [n.战场]
> 1)So it just means it's really difficult to win that battle, I guess, get what you want.Uphill battle is a really great phrase, because you can picture it. You can picture people, you know on top of the hill, you know with all of their weapons and then the people on at the bottom of the hill, you want to take the hill.It's very difficult to take, to go up the hill and kill all those people.

> 2)This is a really great expression if you are in relationship or if you have kids. So pick your battles, it just means you don't always have to fight. And in fact, if you always do fight, you might lose all the time, cause you lose your energy. Yeah, you definitely have to decide which Gordon quote battles are worth fighting.

> 3)love is a battlefield.

# 12.metaphor /'mɛtəfɚ/ [n.隐喻]
> It's basically just when we use one word to describe a word. That is seemingly unrelated.

# 13.conserving [v.保存、保留] 
> A part of the whole reason you want to pick your battles is because you need to conserve both resources, in the case of, you know, like energy, time. But often too, you want to conserve goodwill.

# 14.net positive [phr.正面作用] & net negative [phr.负面作用]
> net positive：So basically, overall, is it a good thing about?Right, we were talking before about trade-offs, right? And of course, you win some, you lose some. But at the end of the day, you're hoping that you have won more than you have lost.

# III.pattern 
***Josh, I’d like to move onto some hypothetical situations. How would you convince[说服] a senior leader to change their mind on a product decision they’ve made?***

***I think in situations like this I would be inclined to use a multi-pronged strategy[多管齐下的策略]. First I would make sure that I’ve done all of my homework to show that I understand how my approach would fit into the operation at large[明白我的方法如何应用于整个方案].***

***That’s sensible. Please continue.***

***Next, I would try to walk them through the trade-offs[试着跟他们分析我的方法的利弊], both good and bad, of my approach, all the while[同时] being prepared to discuss the trade-offs of the current strategy[权衡当前战略的利弊].***

***Would you do anything more concrete[更具体的事情] than just talking?***

***Certainly. I might try to run a small, contained experiment [尝试运行一个小规模的可控实验]to see if the strategy could work in this environment. A proof of concept, if you will[算是验证概念吧].***

***And if after that they still won’t budge?***

***Well even though I don’t shy away from uphill battles[尽管我不怕打硬仗], I’m also a firm believer in picking your battles[但我也坚信应该适时作取舍], if you’ll allow me to extend the metaphor[讲的形象点].***

***So are you saying you would give up?***

***I wouldn’t consider it to be giving up[我不认为这是放弃], so much as conserving both resources and goodwill for another day[而是把资源和信誉保留到以后再用]. And if in the process I have been able to get senior management thinking about new ways of working[如果在这个过程中，我能够让高管们思考新的方法], I would view that as a net positive[我认为这是一个正向的结果].***
