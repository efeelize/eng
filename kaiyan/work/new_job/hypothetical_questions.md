# I.How to answer hypothetical interview questions?
> Hypothetical interview questions can be some of the most challenging questions to answer [最难回答] as they can vary widely[因为它们差异很大、各不相同]. However, these types of questions are important for employers to see how you think on your feet[考察你随机应变的能力], as well as get an accurate sense of how you would approach [处理] regular work situations that may occur in your day-to-day life.Common techniques to answer hypothetical questions.

# 1.Pause, reflect and clarify.
> Take a moment to process the question [思考一下问题] before transitioning into the answer mode[回答之前]. This shows the interviewer you are being thoughtful [深思熟虑] and deeply reflecting on the question.

# 2.Externalize /ɪkˈstɚnəˌlaɪz/ [使具体化] your thinking.
> It is significantly more important to show HOW you work through the question rather than WHAT your answer is.

# 3.Structure along big themes.[理清大的主题]
> Grouping ideas into themes [将你的想法按主题分组] will make it easier for the interviewer to follow your thinking. It is also significant to reflect on why those themes are important.

# 4.Integrate [融入] actual experiences.
> While the situation is hypothetical, to make your answers compelling[令人信服], you can weave [融进] your actual experiences into the answer to show your approach is proven and authentic.[以表明你所说的方法是经过验证、切实可行的。]

# III.pattern 
***Josh, I’d like to move onto some hypothetical situations. How would you convince a senior leader to change their mind on a product decision they’ve made?***

***I think in situations like this I would be inclined to use a multi-pronged strategy. First I would make sure that I’ve done all of my homework to show that I understand how my approach would fit into the operation at large.***

***That’s sensible. Please continue.***

***Next, I would try to walk them through the trade-offs, both good and bad, of my approach, all the while being prepared to discuss the trade-offs of the current strategy.***

***Would you do anything more concrete than just talking?***

***Certainly. I might try to run a small, contained experiment to see if the strategy could work in this environment. A proof of concept, if you will.***

***And if after that they still won’t budge?***

***Well even though I don’t shy away from uphill battles, I’m also a firm believer in picking your battles, if you’ll allow me to extend the metaphor.***

***So are you saying you would give up?***

***I wouldn’t consider it to be giving up, so much as conserving both resources and goodwill for another day. And if in the process I have been able to get senior management thinking about new ways of working, I would view that as a net positive.***
