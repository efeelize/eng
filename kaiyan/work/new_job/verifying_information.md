# I.Job hunting abroad? Don't let cultural differences strap you
> Customs and manners vary all over the planet[世界各地]. It is crucial that you understand the cultural differences beginning with your first job interview.

> “Hierarchy /'haɪərɑrki/ and seniority [层级和资历] are much more important in Asia than here,” Fung says. “In the U.S., a hiring manager[招聘负责人] is likely to address a highly skilled job candidate[面对一个经验丰富的候选人] as an equal.[将对方平等看待] ”

> Eye contact is another example of a huge, but subtle, cultural gap[巨大又微妙的文化差异]. In Japan, looking directly at someone shows a lack of respect. In the U.S., however, interviewers expect it.

> Here are some things to consider as you prepare for your job interview across cultures:

# 1.Interaction
> How you speak and present your experience[谈论和展现你的过往经历] for a typical American interview may be different from what is expected in Asia.

# 2.Formality
> Some cultures expect very formal interactions during the interview, while others are fine with a more easy-going conversation[面试中的交谈可以是比较轻松的].

# 3.Questions
> Different cultures may introduce new questions into the interview mix that you may not have heard before. Don't let these questions catch you off guard.[趁你不备] [别被这些问题打个措手不及]

# II.grammar
# 1.Play a role & take on more challange roles

# 4.front end [n.前段] & back end [后端] & mobile /moˈbil/  development [n.移动开发] & product manager [n.产品经理] & Saas [Software as a Service:软件即服务]
> 1）so front and this is just a word that programmers use. Basically, it's just what you see and interact with on a website or an app.

> 2) the actual program or other people, they usually interact, they usually use the back end. So if you think about like a restaurant, the back end would be like where the chefs make the food, the kitchen, and the front end is the table where the customer eats the food.

> 3)this is essentially just apps.Apps, yeah, they're working on apps. I, computer programmer, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, was probably working on websites, we're at the front end. And, and, now, it's pretty much all apps, all mobile.Yeah. You could say /'məʊbaɪl/ but, it's more of an American thing to say /'məʊbl/.

> 4)product managers. Probably know what a product is, probably know what a manager is.Yeah, put them together, they just deal with the why, the what, everything about the product, like proposing it, or strategy and monitoring /'mɑnətɚ/ it.

# 5.iterations [n.迭代] &  iterate /'ɪtərət/ [v.] & reiterate /rɪ'ɪtəret/ [vt.& n. & adj. 反复地说,重申]
> 1)It's a new version, it's an upgraded, improved version. the past couple years, especially being involved with this company, kind of learning more about tech companies, and even as tech companies kind of take over more and more of society, this word gets used so much.

> 3)So a startup as a small company, usually it's tech-related. Many startups fail, but some startups become big and famous like Google and Facebook. So in this case the company did fail, right? The startup went out of business, but, not before she was promoted to team supervisor in the startup.

# 7.scale up [phr.提升规模] & thrive [v.兴旺发展] & to be promoted [v.晋升] & get a promotion 
> 1）And when you grow to scale you are trying to, you know, increase your customers. But you also need to increase like support. You need to increase… Cuz if you just grow very quickly you'll find that you won't be able to do anything.or you get really overwhelmed with all the extra work.

> 2)you can flourish in an environment or situation. And of course thrive also gets used as an adjective all the time.like a thriving economy.

# III.pattern
***So, Josh, I’d like to know a little about your background. Could you walk me through your resume a bit?***

***Sure. I majored in Computer Science. I worked as a software engineer for the first two years, where I did some front end and mobile development. But for the past three years, I’ve been working as a product manager.***

***Why did you decide to make the switch?***

***I wanted to play a more comprehensive role in the business and have more interactions with different people. That’s why I made the transition.***

***That’s quite a common path. I see in your resume that you have worked for both SaaS and platform companies. Can you describe your experiences?***

***For sure. I worked on a SaaS product as a developer. My PM experience was mostly with the platform company. We were connecting Chinese travellers with overseas tour guides.***

***And you worked there since the beginning?***

***Yes, I joined shortly after the launch and was there for a few major iterations. So I understand all the challenges and growing pains.***
