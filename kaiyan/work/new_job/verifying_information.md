# I.Job hunting abroad? Don't let cultural differences strap you
> Customs and manners vary all over the planet[世界各地]. It is crucial that you understand the cultural differences beginning with your first job interview.

> “Hierarchy /'haɪərɑrki/ and seniority [层级和资历] are much more important in Asia than here,” Fung says. “In the U.S., a hiring manager[招聘负责人] is likely to address a highly skilled job candidate[面对一个经验丰富的候选人] as an equal.[将对方平等看待] ”

> Eye contact is another example of a huge, but subtle, cultural gap[巨大又微妙的文化差异]. In Japan, looking directly at someone shows a lack of respect. In the U.S., however, interviewers expect it.

> Here are some things to consider as you prepare for your job interview across cultures:

# 1.Interaction
> How you speak and present your experience[谈论和展现你的过往经历] for a typical American interview may be different from what is expected in Asia.

# 2.Formality
> Some cultures expect very formal interactions during the interview, while others are fine with a more easy-going conversation[面试中的交谈可以是比较轻松的].

# 3.Questions
> Different cultures may introduce new questions into the interview mix that you may not have heard before. Don't let these questions catch you off guard.[趁你不备] [别被这些问题打个措手不及]

***So, Josh, I’d like to know a little about your background. Could you walk me through your resume a bit?***

***Sure. I majored in Computer Science. I worked as a software engineer for the first two years, where I did some front end and mobile development. But for the past three years, I’ve been working as a product manager.***

***Why did you decide to make the switch?***

***I wanted to play a more comprehensive role in the business and have more interactions with different people. That’s why I made the transition.***

***That’s quite a common path. I see in your resume that you have worked for both SaaS and platform companies. Can you describe your experiences?***

***For sure. I worked on a SaaS product as a developer. My PM experience was mostly with the platform company. We were connecting Chinese travellers with overseas tour guides.***

***And you worked there since the beginning?***

***Yes, I joined shortly after the launch and was there for a few major iterations. So I understand all the challenges and growing pains.***
