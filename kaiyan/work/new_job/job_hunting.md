# I.Mistakes to avoid in the job search
> Mistakes in the job search, even minor ones, could cost you the opportunity. Here are a few mistakes to avoid from Business News Daily to help you when searching and applying for jobs:Using one standard resume [标准简历模板] without customization. It is in your best interest to tailor your resume and cover letter for the specific position.[根据特定职位要求修改简历和求职信]

> Mass-emailing recruiters or employers without a specific role in mind[不写具体的职位]. "If you can't take the time to look at the list of job openings [聘职位列表] and apply for a specific role, why should the hiring manager bother taking the time to review your application?"

> Having a less-than-perfect online presence[在线形象不佳]. Make sure your online profiles are all up to date and look good to an employer. [保证头像看起来得体]"If your resume does get noticed, the first thing a recruiter or hiring manager will do is Google you and look you up on social media."

> Not referencing the job title[不提工作岗位名称]. If you are emailing your application for a specific job, mention the position (and job ID, if applicable[如果有的话附上岗位说明]) in the subject line[邮件正文], as well as the body of the email.

***Hey, Danielle! How's the job hunt going?***

*** Honestly, it's such a drag! I've been so busy rewriting my resume, tweaking them for each job I apply for, and updating my LinkedIn profile. Job hunting is a job in and of itself.***

***I completely empathize. I was you three years ago. How do you go about your search?***

***There are lots of sites and apps now that let you browse job posts easily. You can often apply with a single click.***

***That sounds super convenient! Any standout sites?***

***Indeed and ZipRecruiter are two major job search engines. I also use Glassdoor, since employees can leave honest reviews that companies can't alter.***

***Kind of like Yelp for companies?***

***Exactly! I also read that over 50% of vacancies aren't even advertised. In other words, networking is key.***

*** That's insane! I've actually been thinking about jumping ship recently. A number of recruiters have tried to poach me these past few months, but the companies don't really interest me.***

*** I'm so jealous, Peter! I'd love to be a passive job seeker. That's why I'm also searching for job opportunities by company, since I already know their mission and vision align with mine.***

***Well, best of luck! Let's celebrate once you've found your perfect match!***
