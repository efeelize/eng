> Mass-emailing recruiters or employers without a specific role in mind[不写具体的职位]. "If you can't take the time to look at the list of job openings [聘职位列表] and apply for a specific role, why should the hiring manager bother taking the time to review your application?"

> Having a less-than-perfect online presence[在线形象不佳]. Make sure your online profiles are all up to date and look good to an employer. [保证头像看起来得体]"If your resume does get noticed, the first thing a recruiter or hiring manager will do is Google you and look you up on social media."

> Not referencing the job title[不提工作岗位名称]. If you are emailing your application for a specific job, mention the position (and job ID, if applicable[如果有的话附上岗位说明]) in the subject line[邮件正文], as well as the body of the email.

# 2. job hunt [n.找工作、求职] & recruiters [n.猎头] / headhunters  &  poach [v.挖走员工] & poached egg [水煮蛋] & headhunters /'hɛdhʌntɚ/ [n.猎头] & job seeker [n.求职者]
> 1）This is basically just hunting for a job.it's kind of strange that we do call it a hunt, but it's very time-consuming, you know, there's a lot of time and energy put into this effort of finding a job, so we do often call it a job hunt.

> 2)recruiters, so people that are looking for, you know, talent, looking for people, have tried to poach him.Actually recruiters we often call them headhunters, too. 

> 3)There's a lot of definitions for this word. In terms of the job hunting world, whenever recruiter is trying to poach someone, it means this person already has a job.poaching means to hunt an animal illegally.Unethically. we hear this all the time with the, when it's talent, it could be like maybe 2 sports teams, and the other team tries to get the best players to come over to to their team. That's the same thing. We poach the talent.

So the difference here in Peter and Danielle is that Peter is not an active job seeker, he is a passive job seeker.And it's because particularly that he is employed that he is under this category of being a passive job seeker.He's not doing anything. It's just coming to him passively.

# 4.tweaking /twi:k/ [v.稍微调整]

# 5.apply for & appply to 
> 1) I would say you apply for a job or position.

> 2) you would apply to perhaps a company. I'm applying to Google for engineer.

# 6.in and of itself [phr.这件事本身]
> So this phrase or idiom basically means alone. consider it alone, and because it's an idiom, you don't really, don't try to understand this word by word. It's a chunk, so if I could just go meta /'mɛtə/ [继续探讨] for one second, in and of itself is a very very, you need to understand the phrase in and of itself, in and of itself.

# 7.empathize [v.同理心、感同身受]  & empathy /'ɛmpəθi/ [n.] & sympathy /ˈsɪmpəθi/ [n.]

> 3)You can also talk about aligning in terms of lines, literally lines, or maybe edges. So for example, if you take a photograph and it's a little bit crooked, you can always edit it in some software and make sure the lines, the edges align.Even if you're folding paper, and you could align the edges of the paper, right? To make a nice sharp crisp fold.Someone into origami./ˌɔrɪ'ɡɑmi/ [n. 折纸手工]

# III.pattern
***Hey, Danielle! How's the job hunt going?***

***Honestly, it's such a drag! [没什么进展]I've been so busy rewriting my resume, tweaking them for each job I apply for, and updating my LinkedIn profile. Job hunting is a job in and of itself.[找工作本身就是一项工作]***

***I completely empathize. I was you three years ago. How do you go about your search?***

***There are lots of sites and apps now that let you browse job posts easily. You can often apply with a single click.***

***That sounds super convenient! Any standout sites?***

***Indeed and ZipRecruiter are two major job search engines. I also use Glassdoor, since employees can leave honest reviews that companies can't alter.***

***Kind of like Yelp for companies?***

***Exactly! I also read that over 50% of vacancies aren't even advertised. In other words, networking is key.***

*** That's insane! I've actually been thinking about jumping ship recently. A number of recruiters have tried to poach me these past few months, but the companies don't really interest me.***

*** I'm so jealous, Peter! I'd love to be a passive job seeker. That's why I'm also searching for job opportunities by company, since I already know their mission and vision align with mine.***

***Well, best of luck! Let's celebrate once you've found your perfect match!***
