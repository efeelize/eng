# I.4 secrets to getting a better performance evaluation
# 1. Let your manager know that you're looking forward to your evaluation.
> One reason managers worry about evaluations is that they assume they're nerve-wracking /'nɝv,rækɪŋ/ [烦恼]for employees. If you make it clear that you're looking forward to feedback, you immediately make the process more pleasant.

# 2. Evaluate yourself first. 
> List out how much progress you've made toward your goals and what you'd like to do better in the coming year. If you provide this to your manager, there's a good chance that he/she will pull directly from it when she writes her own.[会很可能从中直接引用内容]

# 3. Keep an evaluation file throughout the year. [全年都要记录好评估档案]
> Keep a file where you jot down /dʒɒt/ /daʊn/ [记录] notes on project successes during the year, so that it's helpful when you're reflecting on your performance during evaluation time. 

# 4.Ask colleagues to give feedback to your manager. 
> Think of who particularly appreciates the work you do and tell them you'd be grateful if they'd provide input to your manager. [向领导提供关于你绩效的反馈]
