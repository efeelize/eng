# I.Tips for making friends at work
# 1.  Put on a happy face
> Before you walk in to the office, put yourself in a great mood. At the very least, if you’re feeling bad for any reason, let that go.

# 2. Make the first move 
> It might be against your more reserved nature[内向], but sometimes all it takes to make a new friend is to say hello.

# 3. Find things you have in common 
> Asking your colleagues question does more than simply get the conversation started, it’s also your way to find out if you share any common interests.

# 4.Be present [不要心不在焉]
> You might be wanting to post to social media[发帖] on your lunch hour, but try to resist the urge if you’re with co-workers. Talk to them instead.

# 5.Ask for help 
> The fact that you don’t know what you’re doing is an advantage; you can ask your new colleagues anything. It’s a chance to talk to people and learn a few things.

# 6. Go to out-of-office events
> It may not sound fun, but hanging with coworkers outside the office is the fastest way to develop lasting friendships.

# II.grammer
# 1.settled in/settle down
> “settle down" is more like kind of just calm down, maybe get married or is, yeah, 

> "settle in" is you've gone into a new environment and you need to get used to it.For example,"Hey Julie, I remember you got this new job. How are you settling in?"

# 2.springboard /'sprɪŋbɔrd/ /stepping stone
> So Julie talks about her old place of work and she said it was more of a springboard to something like this to this company. Yeah yeah so springboard is like I imagine the Olympic diver.Yeah, you're using that bored, so that you can jump higher.

> For sure. Yeah, another term we might use here is stepping stone.Stepping stone. Yeah they both point to the same thing. That job, I had that job, because I wanted this job which is much higher.

# 3.let you in on [phr.透露秘密]
> Right, and when you have a secret, you can say like this, "I'll let you in on a little secret."Right. It just means "tell", right? Tell secret.And it's usually used in this exact way. You could change it, but it's usually a chunk like this, right? I'll let you in on a little secret.

# 4.spoli/spolied/spoliers
> 1）Yeah, so spoil, now things that can spoil. Food can spoil.

> 2）Children, well, I don't think children can spoil. They can be spoiled.Right right. It's when you buy your children everything they want.Right. So in all these cases that, you know, the thing that brings these different meanings together is this idea of ruin. That sounds pretty negative and it sounds like what's Bill saying here is pretty positive.Yeah you can say in a nice way. In this case, Bill is saying " You know, don't worry, the company takes care of us".Yeah there're probably lots of perks, lots of benefits there. In any case, if you say we're pretty spoiled at a company, you're generally saying, you know, like this company is really good to us.

> 3）And the other place we use" spoil" is when talking about spoilers[剧透] for movies.

# 5.relocate
> It's usually more to do with the business, right? Work of some kinds.Yeah, you're moving because of work. It seems to me like it's pretty far away, you're gonna move to a different city.

> Yeah, that's weird because usually if you're a person, like I relocated to come here, but if you go to, for example, like a Starbucks.And I might say like, "Hey we are relocating to, you know, 666 Connor streets."Right right. Yeah so it just depends on the situation there but definitely about work.

# 6.inclusive [adj.包容的]/exclude
> Alright. So you might see the word "include" there. It kind of looks like that one and that's kind of what it means here. You're including every body.Right, so you know before they are letting them in on secrets.Right.And the opposite of "inclusive" would be.

> Right.And the opposite of "inclusive" would be "exclude" someone.

# 7.fit right in[phr.打成一片、融入]/fit in with
> Which just kind of means you can get along with or belong to.Sure. Now notice one thing that I just said. I said that I or a younger version of me could fit in with these groups. I did not say "fit right in".I mean I basically I could fit in with these groups, because I was friendly and did really care what they thought.

> Yeah, "fit right in" is like kind of emphasizing it.Like either more quickly or more perfectly I guess.But "fit right in" is more like I would meet a really nerdy kid who liked music.Yeah yeah, like it suits you perfectly.

# 8.accommodate[v] / accommodation[n] / accommodating[adj]
> 1) accommodation:That's a word we know that means like hotel, where you live.

# 9.tag along [phr.跟大家一起，跟随]

And in this case, she heard some horror stories about the work environment.

# 11.company/firm
> 1)Now another word we see quite a bit when we are talking about business is firm.I would say "all firms are companies, not all companies are firms".Right yeah. But the kind that we usually call a firm is usually to do with the law.The law, the law firm, real estate firm, accounting firm.

> So this is an interesting one. It's basically the same as company.

# 12.hitting up [phr.去看一下]
