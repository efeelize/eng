# I.Tips for making friends at work
# 1.  Put on a happy face
> Before you walk in to the office, put yourself in a great mood. At the very least, if you’re feeling bad for any reason, let that go.

# 2. Make the first move 
> It might be against your more reserved nature[内向], but sometimes all it takes to make a new friend is to say hello.

# 3. Find things you have in common 
> Asking your colleagues question does more than simply get the conversation started, it’s also your way to find out if you share any common interests.

# 4.Be present [不要心不在焉]
> You might be wanting to post to social media[发帖] on your lunch hour, but try to resist the urge if you’re with co-workers. Talk to them instead.

# 5.Ask for help 
> The fact that you don’t know what you’re doing is an advantage; you can ask your new colleagues anything. It’s a chance to talk to people and learn a few things.

# 6. Go to out-of-office events
> It may not sound fun, but hanging with coworkers outside the office is the fastest way to develop lasting friendships.
