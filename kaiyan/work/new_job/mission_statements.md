# Mission_statements
# I.Does the mission statement really matter
> Mission Statement is the foundation to good strategy. It is a statement of the company's purpose. What a company is currently seeking to do for its customers is often termed the company's mission. It answers the question "What is the company's reason for existing?" 

> A mission statement is useful for putting the spotlight on what business a company is presently in and the customer needs it is presently endeavoring to serve. 

> A mission statement is like your North Star. A North Star is not a place you go, it is a fixed point giving you perspective on where you are going. Your mission statement keeps you headed in the right general direction.

> Missions may need to be revised every few years in response to every new turn in the economy. A company must redefine its mission if that mission has lost credibility or no longer defines an optimal course for the company.

***Hey Billy, did you finish the survey about choosing our new mission statement?***

***Yeah I wonder if they're going to go with the Amazon-style "be customer-centric" one.***

***"Maintaining principles while growing" like Starbucks really resonated with me.***

***In any case, do you think it really matters what empty jargon we put up on the walls?***

***Absolutely. I'm here for more than just a paycheck. I want to work for a company that embodies my values.***

***But are you actually empowered to live the values? Our statement has zero alignment with any of the work actually done here.***

***That's why we're changing it: To reflect the situation on the ground, instead of just some lofty ideals.***

***I still think we should come out and say "Make more money by selling more things."***

***It's pithy, to be sure! But maybe you'd prefer it to say "be as cynical as possible."***

***If that were our company's ethos, I'd be CEO by now!***
