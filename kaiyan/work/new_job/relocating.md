- 3. I would like to give a toast to Jeff!

# 2.so much so 
> "so much so" is referring to then being very impressed, So instead of saying so impressed that the board would like to offer you the role, they use this other phrase "so much so" and this "so much so" sounds really fancy.It does sound very fancy, it's a useful phrase.

# 3.to relocate [v.因工作原因搬迁] & be located 
> 1)to relocate is to move for your job. I'm sure all of you guys know the word location, so that's where a thing is. But we can also use the verb to locate or where is something located.

> 2) in the business world, this is often used to talk about where a company is or where you live and work. So for example, the company is headquartered or located in New York, but I am located in Chicago, something like that. So I could ask Cynthia: where are you located?

# 4.proposition /ˌprɑpə'zɪʃən/ [n.提议 & v.]
> 1)When we talk about proposition as a noun, it means simply something that someone is offering. So you can use proposition in any context and its totally fine. I gave them a proposition to go out to dinner tonight, the boss gave him a proposition,a proposal,suggestion and offer.

> 2) But to proposition, to make the verb to proposition means something very specific in English, something very very specific, when you say that someone propositions you, it means that that person is offering sex.

# 5.furnished [v.精装修的] & accommodate [v.容纳]
> 1）So a fully furnished house is a house that has furniture, has everything already. It has a couch, it has a TV, it has a bed, it has everything already. it sounds great, you don't have to worry about furniture at all, everything is there for you already. But sometimes, it's not that great, because you don't get to choose the furniture.

> 2)so accommodate means to fit, to be enough space for your family. So maybe, we don't know, maybe he has 5 children, there need to be enough bedrooms for all the children, so that all the children will be accommodated.

# 6.dental  /'dɛntl/  [adj.]  &  provider  &  schooling 
> 1)So dental is just dental insurance, it's insurance that you can use when you go to the dentist, but a lot of time, we just say dental, we don't really say dental insurance.

> 2)So provider, this is the company that is providing the insurance, company that is responsible for ensuring his health and dental.

> 3) the connotations /ˌkɑnə'teʃən/ [n.内涵] of this word schooling are very specific, it's like you're expecting something really good, like a private education, you're expecting a good top-notch [第一流的] school.You can use schooling in any context, but the implication of it is that your kids have always gone to the best school, and now you're moving to this other country, where are my kids going to continue to get their amazing schooling, their amazing education? So it's something like that, again that being said you can use schooling in any situation, but that's the sort of slant  /slænt/ [n.倾向] of the word.

# 7.certified [adj.具有资质的]
> So when someone is certified that means that they have gone to school, they've had enough schooling, so that they get a certificate at the end and they can perform a certain task or duty.
