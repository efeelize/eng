# Tough_interview
# I.Making a good impression in the interview
> It is common for job interviewers to throw more difficult questions at you, especially for non-entry level positions[高级职位]. In these situations, interviewers are rarely trying to just antagonize /æn'tæɡənaɪz/ [v.与...作对] you[不是为了跟你作对]. Rather, they are often looking to see how you explain yourself [为自己辩解] and your actions under stress[在压力下作何反应]. In these situations, it is best to be firm but not cocky [不自负] – explain yourself confidently and firmly. 

> If you need to take some time to think about it, do so. Your interviewer is more likely to appreciate a slower but thoroughly crafted /krɑ:ft/ [adj.精心制作的] response than a quick but incomplete answer. Using buzzwords in interviews is good as well, but make sure you have the examples to back your words. If not, your answers will come out sounding empty. 

> Lastly, be wary of [当心] questions about your weakness. Many interviewees fall into the trap of saying I’m a “perfectionist.” This is a clichéd [陈词滥调] response that won’t earn you any extra points. Rather than taking a line from the internet, be honest about your weakness but avoid saying anything that would be a deal-breaker[致命的弱点]. 

# II.grammar
# 1.As long as & provided that 

- 1. As long as I'm engaged in work that I love, I don't really care about working long hours.

- 2. As long as you think it's a good investment, I'll follow your advice and put my money into that cheap stock.

- 3. As long as the weather is nice, we can go for a hike.

# 2.resume & CV  &  curriculum /kə'rɪkjələm/ vitae /'vi:tai/ [n.个人简历；血液；vita的复数] 
> 1)so this word "resume" of course we hear this a lot in a business or work context, A resume should be for a work context you know maybe one, two pages maximum.

> 2)technically a CV which stands for curriculum vitae is an academic resume.So it's usually much longer has you can list a lot more experience, you know could be many many pages long. if you're playing for an academic job though they will almost always say "CV" and that means much longer, much more detail, everything you've ever researched, all that kind of information.

> 3)but nowadays I think even in businesses they're used pretty interchangeably, so both of them though will probably have experience，work history...it's just may be the difference would be the details beyond that.

# 3.you've yet stay at a single job 
> this is just a formal way when you use this language, you've yet to stay at a job, you could also say exactly the same thing by saying "but I see that you haven't stayed at a single job", but "you've yet" is just a little bit more formal.

# 4.freelance [adj.兼职的] & full time 
> 1)So freelance means you are hired specifically to do maybe a project or short term assignment, and short term could mean a couple weeks, it could mean a couple of months or six months in this case; so the easiest way to think of it is that you've got freelance and you've got full time.it's, it's by nature [n.性质] it is short term and usually six months or under I would say is what defines freelance work.

> 2)full time would mean you're hired and you are working there until either you leave or they fire you.

# 5.nature [n.性质]
> the nature means the essence /'ɛsns/ ,the way it's done.

# 6.honing /'həuniŋ/ [v.磨炼] & productive [adj.有效的、有积极意义的]
> 1）so to hone something means to perfect it, means to you can think of it almost like it's a knife you know you're sharpening a knife, you're honing skills, you're sharpening them, making...making them better in some way.Ok, I think that's a great way to look at it, but in this case we're talking about administrative skills.So the knife would be answering telephones, writing correspondence...maybe not the knife he's looking for.so he's...you know, obviously if he's in Marketing advertising, you know, administrative skills...honing those administrative skills is not something he was interested in and he says specifically "was not the most productive use of my time".

> 2)there is a good difference I need to point out between saying "this was not the best use of my time" instead of "this was not the most productive use of my time", and the difference is productive is just a little more specific.I think as you get higher and higher in your language level you want to use specific words to convey meaning so by saying "this was not the best use of my time", it's a little general it also sounds maybe you know, with an english ear, sounds...I don't know, you might say arrogant /'ærəɡənt/.Exactly, that he wants to be productive.

# 7.stand up for myself [phr.为自己站出来] & up for [phr.准备好了、乐意加入]
> 1)stand up for myself: so this is just a way of saying you know what you want and you're not afraid to maybe tell other people about that or to make decisions based on what it is that you really do want, so in this case stand up for himself means he was willing to quit this job that was a full time job, because he knew he didn't want to just be doing administrative work.

> 2) She thinks it's a great plan and she expresses that by saying "I'm up for that."Yes, so "I'm up for something" means that I am willing to do that.Yeah yeah, like so it's a real casual, soft, you know, kind of lightweight to say I would you like or do you want to do that.

- 1)The whole question of shcool curriculum is up for discussion.[某事需要去做...]
- 2)One or two people like to get to school early, but most of us would be up for going in later[准备做某事]

# 8.step up [phr.在需要时采取行动] & take on [phr.承担] & put sb on sth. & up their game [phr.拿出更好的表现]
> 1）"step up" just really means to put in that extra effort to take on more responsibility.I'm sure everyone knows someone like that at a company, or maybe you're that person at your company. Maybe you step up when people need help or something needs to be done. we often hear a line like, "oh, we were falling behind, so I had to step up." Or, "I stepped up because no one else was doing anything."

> 2)So "take on" is another phrasal verb that we always use at work. And it, basically, just means "start doing more things" or "be responsible for more things."Or maybe you have a second job, so you can say, "Hey, I had to take on a second job to make some more money."

> 3)So, here she is more "being put on" these bigger projects. So, her boss's kind of giving it to her, right? So usually, when we're taking things on, we're doing it because we want to. We're doing it because it's our choice. And usually, when we are put on something, it's because it's someone else's choice.

> 4)When you're upping your game you are improving.I think it means different things in different circumstances. But in the workplace it means, you know, getting more sales, increasing your numbers. You know, basically improving your performance. 

# 9.restructuring /ri'strʌktʃərɪŋ/ [v.重组] & transitions.[n.变动]
> 1)This is like a big change in the organization of a company.Yeah, sometimes like a whole department will disappear, and if your department is removed, then probably don't have a job unless they move you to a different department.

> 2)she says despite these transitions she was always working in marketing, so these transitions she's referring to are all of her changes, the movement she had in jobs.

# 10.metrics /'mɛtrɪks/ [n.计量模型] & matrix  /'metrɪks/ [n.矩阵]
> 1)So a metric is some kind of information that you measure, they can be things like how many people are visiting your website, how many units have a product you have sold. It's whatever is the most important piece of information for your job. 

> 2)So if you're a salesperson, probably your key metric is your sales numbers, right? If you're running the marketing for a website, maybe your key metric is the traffic coming to the website, right? So often, you talk about "key metrics", the most important data or information for your job.

# 11.leverage /'lɛvərɪdʒ/ [v.影响] & bring out the best in sb 
> 1)To leverage a team is just to use them well.

> 2)she also is good at bringing out the best in them, so this is a really common phrase that we use to bring out the best in somebody.Yes, especially for a leader, you have to find ways to get people motivated to make them do their best work.So not everybody is good at everything, but she is able to find what they are best at, and have them do it well.

# III.pattern
***Mark, thanks for coming in for the interview this morning.***

***So looking over your resume, I see you've had lots of different experiences since graduation, which is a great asset. But I see that you've yet to stay at a single job for longer than six months. Why is that?***

***Well, as you can see, much of my previous work experience was project-based freelance work. Due to the nature of these projects, they only lasted a few months.***

***Of course. But what about your time at MX Advertising? It seems to have been a full-time position but you only stayed for five months.***

***Working at MX Advertising was an important learning experience but within a couple months my position there became mostly administrative work, which was not what it started out as. I felt that honing administrative skills was not the most productive use of my time at that point in my career so I decided to move on.***

***But jobs at small companies, including ours, often involve taking on responsibilities that you may have not initially expected to have, including administrative work. How do we know that you would not leave this position if your responsibilities here slowly changed in a way you didn't like?***

***My job at MX Advertising had changed to become only administrative responsibilities. As long as I am still engaged in the work that first attracted me to the role, I am happy to take on additional duties, including administrative work.***

***So obviously that was the con of that experience. What were the positive aspects?***

***It taught me to stand up for myself professionally. In that case, it meant leaving the company when the role and work environment were no longer productive towards my goals.***

# IV.pattern
***Good afternoon, Melinda. Thanks for coming in for the interview. Here's my card. Please have a seat.***

***Nice to meet you, Paul! Thank you for this opportunity.***

***Well, let's get started. First, could you tell me a little about your educational background?***

***Of course. I graduated from UCLA in 2008, with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing. After working for 2 years, I went on to get my MBA from the University of Texas, graduating in 2011.***

***Ok. I saw on your resume that you've worked at various companies for relatively short periods of time. What is your reason for moving around so much?***

***Well, after finishing my undergrad, I started to work for a startup as a Marketing Assistant and then was promoted to Team Supervisor. It was a very small company so I was able to gain a lot of experience in various areas of marketing. Unfortunately, the company went out of business after a year. The next 2 positions I held were short-lived because of company restructuring and my decision to pursue an MBA degree. But despite the transitions, I’ve always worked in marketing and have continued developing my skills and experience in this field. I’ve managed to grow in each position, taking on more challenging roles and managing more team members.***

***I see…Why do you think we should hire you as our Marketing Manager?***

***Well, I love your product. It's always been my dream to work for the firm. I believe I have both the knowledge and skills to be the Marketing Manager as I've worked in both offline and online businesses, which is a great fit with your firm.***

***What would you say are your greatest strengths?***

***I've proven to be a problem solver. I'm very good at analyzing problems and coming up with solutions. I know what key metrics to measure and how to improve them. I'm also extremely driven and proactive.***

***Very good. And what about your greatest weakness?***

***Well, I used to try to do everything myself. But as I worked in more senior roles, I've learned that a good manager needs to leverage her team and bring out the best in them.***

***Lastly, what kind of goals do you have for yourself professionally?***
