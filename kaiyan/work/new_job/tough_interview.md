# I.Making a good impression in the interview
> It is common for job interviewers to throw more difficult questions at you, especially for non-entry level positions[高级职位]. In these situations, interviewers are rarely trying to just antagonize /æn'tæɡənaɪz/ [v.与...作对] you[不是为了跟你作对]. Rather, they are often looking to see how you explain yourself [为自己辩解] and your actions under stress[在压力下作何反应]. In these situations, it is best to be firm but not cocky [不自负] – explain yourself confidently and firmly. 

> If you need to take some time to think about it, do so. Your interviewer is more likely to appreciate a slower but thoroughly crafted /krɑ:ft/ [adj.精心制作的] response than a quick but incomplete answer. Using buzzwords in interviews is good as well, but make sure you have the examples to back your words. If not, your answers will come out sounding empty. 

> Lastly, be wary of [当心] questions about your weakness. Many interviewees fall into the trap of saying I’m a “perfectionist.” This is a clichéd [陈词滥调] response that won’t earn you any extra points. Rather than taking a line from the internet, be honest about your weakness but avoid saying anything that would be a deal-breaker[致命的弱点].

***Mark, thanks for coming in for the interview this morning.***

***So looking over your resume, I see you've had lots of different experiences since graduation, which is a great asset. But I see that you've yet to stay at a single job for longer than six months. Why is that?***

***Well, as you can see, much of my previous work experience was project-based freelance work. Due to the nature of these projects, they only lasted a few months.***

***Of course. But what about your time at MX Advertising? It seems to have been a full-time position but you only stayed for five months.***

***Working at MX Advertising was an important learning experience but within a couple months my position there became mostly administrative work, which was not what it started out as. I felt that honing administrative skills was not the most productive use of my time at that point in my career so I decided to move on.***

***But jobs at small companies, including ours, often involve taking on responsibilities that you may have not initially expected to have, including administrative work. How do we know that you would not leave this position if your responsibilities here slowly changed in a way you didn't like?***

***My job at MX Advertising had changed to become only administrative responsibilities. As long as I am still engaged in the work that first attracted me to the role, I am happy to take on additional duties, including administrative work.***

***So obviously that was the con of that experience. What were the positive aspects?***

***It taught me to stand up for myself professionally. In that case, it meant leaving the company when the role and work environment were no longer productive towards my goals.***

***Good afternoon, Melinda. Thanks for coming in for the interview. Here's my card. Please have a seat.***

***Nice to meet you, Paul! Thank you for this opportunity.***

***Well, let's get started. First, could you tell me a little about your educational background?***

***Of course. I graduated from UCLA in 2008, with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing. After working for 2 years, I went on to get my MBA from the University of Texas, graduating in 2011.***

***Ok. I saw on your resume that you've worked at various companies for relatively short periods of time. What is your reason for moving around so much?***

***Well, after finishing my undergrad, I started to work for a startup as a Marketing Assistant and then was promoted to Team Supervisor. It was a very small company so I was able to gain a lot of experience in various areas of marketing. Unfortunately, the company went out of business after a year. The next 2 positions I held were short-lived because of company restructuring and my decision to pursue an MBA degree. But despite the transitions, I’ve always worked in marketing and have continued developing my skills and experience in this field. I’ve managed to grow in each position, taking on more challenging roles and managing more team members.***

***I see…Why do you think we should hire you as our Marketing Manager?***

***Well, I love your product. It's always been my dream to work for the firm. I believe I have both the knowledge and skills to be the Marketing Manager as I've worked in both offline and online businesses, which is a great fit with your firm.***

***What would you say are your greatest strengths?***

***I've proven to be a problem solver. I'm very good at analyzing problems and coming up with solutions. I know what key metrics to measure and how to improve them. I'm also extremely driven and proactive.***

***Very good. And what about your greatest weakness?***

***Well, I used to try to do everything myself. But as I worked in more senior roles, I've learned that a good manager needs to leverage her team and bring out the best in them.***

***Lastly, what kind of goals do you have for yourself professionally?***
