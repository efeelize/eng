# I.What is a 360 review in the workplace?
> The 360 review is a professional feedback opportunity that enables a group of coworkers to provide feedback on an employee’s performance. The feedback is generally asked for by the manager to whom the employee reports.[通常是负责这位员工的上司向大家寻求反馈意见]

> Coworkers who participate in the 360 review usually include the employee's boss, several peers, and functional managers with whom the employee works regularly.

> Hence, the name of the feedback opportunity [反馈的机会] comes from the fact that performance feedback is solicited from all directions in the organization[是因为对工作表现的反馈是来自公司内部各个角度的]. The objective of the feedback is to give the employee the opportunity to understand how their work is viewed in the total organization.[整个组织内部对他们工作的看法是怎样的。]

> The 360 review differs from an employee appraisal [员工评估] which traditionally provides the employee with the opinion of his or her performance as viewed by their manager. These employee appraisals tend to focus on the progress the employee achieved on job goals. The 360 review tends to focus more on how the employee affected the work of other employees than on whether the work was accomplished.

# 1.hence
> The word "hence" means "therefore", but is used to give a reason or explanation for something that the listener/reader might have been wondering, but didn’t ask specifically. It’s another way to say "that’s why…."

- 3. She just got her dream job, hence her good mood and fancy new car.

***Hey, Ross, have you done your 360 reviews yet?***

***Nah, I’m not really sure what to write. Peer assessments always seem so convoluted.***

***It’s pretty easy, actually. Just follow the prompts and focus on what your colleague does well in their position.***

***Oh, so you don’t write about deficiencies?***

***Not unless it’s a major issue. And no need to ramble on. They’re supposed to be short and sweet so you don’t get tired out.***

***That doesn’t seem so bad. But, honestly, I wonder if these reviews actually help the business. Seems like it’s just another administrative hoop to jump through.***

***Well, if the implementation is flawed, yeah, it can be a waste of time. But when done right, it’s a highly equitable process.***

***The 360 review focuses more on how the employee affects the work of others and contributes to the whole organization. The goal is to provide balanced and actionable feedback.***

***Hmm, now I’m starting to see the point of these evaluations.***

***Absolutely. The whole point of having multiple raters is to get feedback from all angles, hence the name 360. When you take all that together, you end up with a really good gauge of someone’s skills and potential.***

***That does make sense, actually. I better get on that, then.***
