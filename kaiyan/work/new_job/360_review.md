# 360_review
# I.What is a 360 review in the workplace?
> The 360 review is a professional feedback opportunity that enables a group of coworkers to provide feedback on an employee’s performance. The feedback is generally asked for by the manager to whom the employee reports.[通常是负责这位员工的上司向大家寻求反馈意见]

> Coworkers who participate in the 360 review usually include the employee's boss, several peers, and functional managers with whom the employee works regularly.

> Hence, the name of the feedback opportunity [反馈的机会] comes from the fact that performance feedback is solicited from all directions in the organization[是因为对工作表现的反馈是来自公司内部各个角度的]. The objective of the feedback is to give the employee the opportunity to understand how their work is viewed in the total organization.[整个组织内部对他们工作的看法是怎样的。]

> The 360 review differs from an employee appraisal [员工评估] which traditionally provides the employee with the opinion of his or her performance as viewed by their manager. These employee appraisals tend to focus on the progress the employee achieved on job goals. The 360 review tends to focus more on how the employee affected the work of other employees than on whether the work was accomplished.

# II.grammar
# 1.hence
> The word "hence" means "therefore", but is used to give a reason or explanation for something that the listener/reader might have been wondering, but didn’t ask specifically. It’s another way to say "that’s why…."

- 1. They’re getting married next week, hence their excitement and stress. 

- 2. The first president of the USA was George Washington, hence the name of its capital city. 

- 3. She just got her dream job, hence her good mood and fancy new car. 

# 2.360 review [three sixty] & 360
> 1)it means 360 degrees.which of course if any of you are paying attention, basically means everywhere around you.so people are reviewing you from all angles.

> 2)it's interesting though, because a lot of people will use incorrectly, I should say, will use 360 to mean, like to turn around or change their minds that "He did a 360 on that, before he liked spinach. He did 360." But actually it should be 180.cause 360 means you're going the same direction again.

# 3.evaluation [n.评价] & assessment & peer evalutaion & peer assessments [n.同事互评] & performance evaluation [n.绩效考核] & performance-based [adj.基于绩效的] & non-performance-based [adj.不基于绩效的] & rater /'retɚ/ [n.评估人]
> 1)so an evaluation is just a review. evaluation you're just like judging its quality.It's looking back at someone's work over the year. So they take kind of information like, how much overtime [n.加班时间] they did, how much money they earn for the company, and then they use that as their evaluation to determine whether they'll get a promotion or a bonus.

> 2)so assessment is all about like improving kind of, you're trying to improve the value of something.

> 3) you could say peer evaluation and sometimes people do say peer evaluation.

> 4)we can evaluate other things besides employees, right? Maybe you don't know what school you're gonna go to, so you say, "I need to evaluate my options."

> 5) so based on performance or bonuses that are based on performance, that can be shortened into performance-based bonuses.

> 6) so that's where she says, she says there is a non-performance-based bonus, that's the Chinese New Year bonus, but there's also another one, a performance-based one as well.

> 7)in any case it's just somebody who gives a rating.Not a super common word, but something you could kind of have fun with there. 

# 4.convoluted /'kɑnvəlutɪd/  [adj.复杂的]
> it means complicated, but in an unreasonable way.When something is convoluted, it's just unnecessarily complicated.now stories can often be convoluted as well, especially when these stories are excuses.like why are you late? Well, because my dog was hungry, but the store they were out of dog food, so I had to go to a different store, but the second store was actually being robbed by aliens who come from a planet where there's no dog food, but they need dog food to live, so...

- 1. His essay was long and convoluted [又长又绕]. I couldn’t understand his point. 

- 2. It was a very convoluted plot [情节]. It would be better to make it simpler. 

- 3. Our workflow [工作流程] became so convoluted that we had to renew our strategy. 

# 5.prompts /prɔmpt/ [v.提示]
> so can be a noun or a verb, and it's kind of some message or a signal to do something.Even actually on a test, if you're taking an English test or any kind of test, the prompt is the question.So you've got like a question and ABCD, pick one where the prompt is the question.and that not comes up a lot to in listening tests.listen to the prompts.

# 6.deficiency /dɪ'fɪʃənsi/ [n.缺陷] & weakness & flaw & shortcoming 
> 1）a deficiency is a fancy way to say weakness.but "defficient" I mean it really, kind of sounds very technical, like a machine. You have to set some kind of deficiency in the machine or the system.There's something lacking in it, often we can say a person has a vitamin /'vaɪtəmɪn/ deficiency.

> 2)falwed,it just means you're imperfect. when I say I'm flawed, I don't mean that like, oh, I'm flawed. Life is so bad.

# 7.ramble on [phr.啰嗦闲谈] & drone /dron/ on [唠唠叨叨地说]
> 1)so ramble on is just kind of like you're talking and you're talking, maybe in a convoluted way. "ramble on" can be very excited or excite a bowl. Like a kid might ramble on about his first day at school.

> 2)usually "drone on" is when you're talking, and it's just as boring. 

# 8.short and sweet [phr.简洁明了] & sweet and to the point 
> To the point. Yeah, to the point, making it concise, in a nutshell /'nʌtʃɛl/ [概括].the reason why you want to do that. It's because you don't want to tire yourself out, these things can be very very time-consuming, and also very very tiring.especially when you have a lot of other work to do.

# 9.administrative [adj.行政的] & administration [n.行政机构]
> 1)administrative, this is just a word that means anything to do with running or managing a company.

> 2) administration:We tend to use that more in the political world.

# 10.hoop tp jump through [phr.繁琐的步骤] & jump through a hoop & red tape /tep/ [n. 繁文缛节] & cut red tape

> 1) "hoops to jump through" is, you may have seen this before, it just means that you have to do something difficult, challenging, a little annoying maybe, but it's required.A hoop, it means something you have to do, it's part of your job.I may not be challenging, but it's maybe annoying, at least annoying. Like the hoops would be things like the forms, This form, that form. I need three copies of this form, this form needs to be on six different kinds of paper with twelve different colors, like that. Those would be the hoops.

> 2)jumping through a hoop is pretty easy to do.Like a hoop is a very big circle, and where this comes from is the circus, right? Get the lion to jump through the hoop for some. It's probably pretty easy for the lion to do.

> 3)red tape is more about something I would like to do like restrictions. You can't do it because there is a restriction. Usually the red tape is put there again by administrations or management.like if a restaurant wants to sell liquor, sell beer or wine, they have to apply for a liquor license and there're something to a lot of red tape.

# 11.implementation [n.实施] & actionable [adj.可行的;可诉的]
> 1）so to implement something is similar to execute something, to start a plan, to kind of put that plan into action. so I think that probably the biggest difference is implementation doesn't necessarily mean see it the whole way through. Like you could implement a plan, and I'm just kind of forget about it. In fact, I do that every week of my life. I am going to implement this new diet regime /re'ʒim/ [节食].

> 2) actionable：It's really just practical.it's something you put into action.if you look at the dictionary, it's from like legal systems, law courts. That's where this words from.And now we just use it in business a lot.

# 12.equitable /ˈɛkwɪtəbəl/ [adj.公平的] & equality /ɪ'kwɑləti/ [n. 同等,平等] & equal /'ikwəl/ [adj.相等的, 同样的]
> 1)equitable or this idea of equity, this has in my lifetime, this word has really really exploded or this idea,this concept has really exploded, because the old idea is equality.and the key difference there is that equitable means fair.

> 2)equal means the same.

# III.pattern
***Hey, Ross, have you done your 360 reviews yet?***

***Nah, I’m not really sure what to write. Peer assessments always seem so convoluted.***

***It’s pretty easy, actually. Just follow the prompts and focus on what your colleague does well in their position.***

***Oh, so you don’t write about deficiencies?***

***Not unless it’s a major issue. And no need to ramble on. They’re supposed to be short and sweet so you don’t get tired out.***

***That doesn’t seem so bad. But, honestly, I wonder if these reviews actually help the business. Seems like it’s just another administrative hoop to jump through.***

***Well, if the implementation is flawed, yeah, it can be a waste of time. But when done right, it’s a highly equitable process.***

***The 360 review focuses more on how the employee affects the work of others and contributes to the whole organization. The goal is to provide balanced and actionable feedback.***

***Hmm, now I’m starting to see the point of these evaluations.***

***Absolutely. The whole point of having multiple raters is to get feedback from all angles, hence the name 360. When you take all that together, you end up with a really good gauge of someone’s skills and potential.***

***That does make sense, actually. I better get on that, then.***
