# Problem solving skills
# I.Six ways to improve your problem-solving skills 
# 1. Dance your heart out
> Did you know that dance has a positive impact on neural processing？If you engage in ballet or another form of structured dances, it may help you find a single, appropriate answer to a problem.

# 2.Work out your brain with logic puzzles or games
> To build up your brain muscle and develop new problem-solving techniques, practice some logic puzzles and other games. 

# 3.Get a good night's sleep
> More than any other sleeping or awake state, Rapid Eye Movement (REM) [眼球快速运动（REM）] sleep directly enhances creative [直接改善] processing in the brain. 

# 4.Work out to some tunes [听一些音乐]
> The combination of music and exercise may stimulate and increase cognitive /'kɑɡnətɪv/  [adj.认知的] arousal /ə'raʊzl/ while helping to organize the cognitive output [认知的输出].

# 5.Keep an "idea journal" 
> Working out problems by sorting your thoughts on paper and then viewing them more objectively is easier than having all your thoughts stuck in your head [全部禁锢在大脑中].

# 6.Participate in yoga
> The powerful combination of body awareness [身体的知觉], breathing [呼吸], and meditation [冥想] that is required during yoga practice has been shown to significantly raise cognitive test scores [提高认知能力]. 

# II.grammar
# 1.what seems to be +n.
> 1)"seem." It means it looks that way or it appears in that way. And so the basic way to use "seem" is as a linking verb, like "you seem happy," "you seem sad."

> 2) the first thing that does is it makes it easier and more natural to use a noun after "seem."So it's possible to say "what seems the problem." But it's really unusual. We usually say "what seems to be" +  a noun. What seems to be the problem? It also makes it more polite. and it's not just with nouns. It's with adjectives, too. Like, I could say Tom seems to be sad.

> 3)we also just use the "to" plus infinitive, so that we can use regular verbs after "seem." For example, Tom always seems to lose his phone.

> 4)now one note, we don't use "seem" in the continuous tense. So I wouldn't say "what is seeming to be the problem." That just sounds weird.But sometimes we do use this, but not in this case. It's very unusual. There's also another polite construction that we can use. We can say there seems to be. Like, for example, you know Johnny, you and I sometimes make mistakes. We're not perfect. So maybe some users say "there seems to be a mistake in the lesson." And that's a very polite way to do that.

- 1. My friend never seems to remember my birthday.

- 2. Who seems to be upset?

- 3. My phone appears to be missing. Have you seen it?

# 2.getting on top of me [phr.让我难以应对]
> 1)this is a good phrase here "getting on top of me." We always say it like this, we never say getting above me. Basically, it just means you're unable to deal with something or manage something.and this is very often at work. Your work gets on top of you means you can't manage it because there is too much of it.

> 2)Or it could also be in relationships. And if your work or your relationships get on top of you, well, you have to get on top of them.so that's the other way to use this phrase, is when you do well, you get things done, you get on top of your tasks, on top of your work. That's a good thing.

> 3)I think it's important to note that we always say "get on top of something," we never say "get on top of doing."

> 4)That's right and another note here, the sentence starts like this, "I feel things have been..." Just a note here, it means "I feel that things have been..." not "I feel things that..." 

# 3.tough time/life [n.困难] & tough guy 
> 1)"tough time" :This just means difficult time. This is usually the word we use. You can say hard time. Tough time is also really common, like if work was really hard today for you, maybe you come home to your wife or husband, and you say, "Oh, it's such a tough day at the office. Give me some dinner.Give me a beer. ” if someone's having a tough time, that usually means there's a problem and so Bill asks, "What seems to be the problem, Peter?"

> 2)Or you might have had, like a tough life. Usually people, if they've had a tough childhood, that means their life hasn't been great. It's been tough."

> 3) this is different from saying a person is tough, like if I say Johnny, you're so tough, that's a good thing. That means Johnny's strong.So it can be negative or positive, depending on who or what you're describing.

# 4.underlying [adj.暗含的]
> If something's underlying, it's very basic, but it's not obvious to us. We can't really see it, and this could be for a couple of reasons. Maybe it's hard to see or we ignore it.our emotions, our feelings, they might have some secret cause or reason that some underlying cause that we can't see it. Sometimes we need a friend to help us.and these causes can be hurting us. They could be creating an underlying condition, so something like depression or like anxiety makes me think of that.and the underlying message of this lesson is that we can all learn some ways to improve our problem-solving skills and one of those ways Bill says here, he says, "I use the IDEAL framework."

# 5.identify [v.识别] & define [v.定义] & DTR/define the relationship
> 1)so if you identify something, you recognize it. You know what it is. It isn't underlying any more.and you can identify a thing, like a problem. You can identify a person, like when the police find a criminal, they have to identify him, they have to know who he is. Also like, if I think of the coronavirus /kə,rəunə'vaiərəs/ , a lot of doctors were trying to identify the problem. They are trying to identify the underlying issues with the virus.

> 2)"define" here, we use this word a lot as English teachers, like what's the definition? That's the noun form. In this case, the verb is define, but it doesn't just mean "meaning." In this case, define means describing.describe it so that you can fully understand it. You can know what it is. It's also used in like internet language sometimes, too.

> 3) I remember when I was in high school and university, we had this other acronym called "DTR." It means define the relationship. Whenever a girl and a guy start hanging out, and you know things get a little bit more romantic and finally, someone has to ask, "Hey, let's have a DTR. Are we a couple or not? Are we just friends?"

# 6.context & take out of context & put it in context [phr.联系一下背景]
> 1)so the "context" is like the details or the facts surrounding the situation. this is another word that we use all the time as English teachers, because context is so important in language. For example, the word "run," you can run down the streets, but your refrigerator can also run. Those have two different meanings in different contexts.

> 2) "take out of context.":so it means you only take this one little part and you pull it out of the situation and then if you take things out of context, it doesn't really make sense.like if I tell Connor I like to sleep in, but only on the weekends and then Connor tells Adam, "Hey, Johnny likes to sleep in." And then Adam thinks I like to sleep in all the time, but that's not true. That's out of context.

> 3)it's always important to put it in context, like in this case, you need to put the problem in the context in this situation.

# III.pattern

***Yeah. I think overall I need to improve my problem-solving skills. So what should I do?***

***I use the IDEAL framework. First, you need to identify the problem. After that, define the context of the problem.***

***Sounds about right. Ok, then what?***

***Then you should start to explore possible strategies***

***So once I've done that, I'm guessing I should act on the best solution?***

***Bingo. After that, all you have to do is look back and learn.***

***Wow, I feel like I've learned a lot already.***
