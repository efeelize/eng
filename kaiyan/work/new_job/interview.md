# I.top 3 questions to ask about every new job
> When it comes to choosing the right place to work, most people focus on the role and the salary. But veteran /'vɛtərən/ [adj.有经验的] job seekers say there's one more factor that may be even more important.

> Workplace culture is a mix of the company's values, practices[n.做法], leadership and attitudes. In other words, it's related to the company's beliefs and the way the company works. Each company has its own unique culture and the right one can greatly improve your overall satisfaction and success.

> Well, you can start by exploring job and company review apps, like Glassdoor in the US, or Maimai in China. And for sure, talk to some employees and ask them about how their culture is different. Find out what makes them tick[phr.是什么激励了他们] and if they value the same things as you.

> If you find that the answers are similar, you can dig deeper and ask more specific questions. For example:How does the company motivate employees?What is the company's attitude toward flex-time (or flexible work hours)?When and how do co-workers give feedback to each other?Of course, you might not get an honest answer every time, so try to ask people from different levels.
