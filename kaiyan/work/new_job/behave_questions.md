# Behave_questions
# I.Behavioral interview questions and the STAR technique
> Behavioral interview questions [行为面试问题] focus on how you handled various work situations in the past. Your response will reveal your skills, abilities, and personality. Answers to behavioral interview questions should be in the form of a brief anecdote /'ænɪkdot/ [n.简短故事] that illustrates your strengths and skills as a worker.

> The STAR technique is a useful strategy for responding to interview questions that require an anecdote. It’s an excellent way to organize your thoughts[梳理思路]. There are four steps using this technique:

# 1.(S) Situation
> Describe the situation in which the event took place.

# 2.(T) Task
> Describe the task you were asked to complete. If there was a particular problem or issue you were trying to solve, describe that here.

# 3.(A) Action
> Explain what action you took to complete the task or solve the problem.

# 4.(R) Results
> Explain the result of your actions. For example, if your actions resulted in completing a task, resolving a conflict[解了一个冲突], improving your company’s sales record, etc., explain this. Try to focus on how your actions resulted in a success for the company.

# 1.One’’s (fair) share
> "fair share" is a phrase that gets used a lot when talking about our past experiences, let’s take a minute to break it down.[在谈论过去经验时常用的词]

> 1) The first is very literal and logical: one’s equal part. It can be a share of things that we often have with others in common: benefits such as profits, or responsibilities such as chores.[第一层是字面意思，就是某人应该做或应得的部分，比如表示利润或任务]

> 2)The next level of meaning however is where this phrase gets more interesting. That’s because the "share" that we are referring to is almost always something negative. You will hear people talk about having their "fair share of disappointments", or their "fair share of heartaches". Again, it doesn’t necessarily have to be negative, but it almost always is.

> 3)You don’t actually need to say the word "fair". You could say "my share", and the meaning would still be clear. However, you might have noticed by now that English native speakers love rhyming, and we often use rhymes as a way to stress or emphasize ideas.[现在很多英语母语者讲话追求押韵，这样可以起到强调作用.]

- 1. Life has its fair share of painful times. How you deal with them is how you grow as a person. [人生不如意十有八九，你的应对方式反映你为人处世的层次。]

- 2. Sure, I’ve seen my fair share of ups and downs, but I’ve always tried to stay positive. [我历经起伏，但一直尽力保持积极态度。]

- 3. At my last job, my team had a few wins, but also our fair share of setbacks. [我的上一份工作里，团队虽然也有过一些成就，但挫败的体会也不少。]

***Josh, I’m sure you often have to work under pressure and manage aggressive deadlines. Can you describe how you handle these situations?***

***Of course, Katherine. I’d say that first and foremost as a product manager, you simply need to have strong project management skills and be extremely on the ball about implementing them.***

***Can you be more specific?***

***Yes. Hold the entire team accountable for status reporting, risk management, change control and other project management techniques. You can’t be lazy and skip them.***

***Kill issues as soon as they arise. Don’t let it become something bigger or fester over time. Issue management is a daily function.***

***Be flexible and have the big picture in mind. Very often, you need to defer some activities to make sure the more important ones get done first.***

***Embrace parallel activities. Break the project into segments and identify things that are not interdependent. Do them in parallel.***

***That’s certainly very important.***

***And communicate. In fact, over-communicate. Use both formal and informal channels to make sure everyone is on the same page.***

***Well, Josh, I can tell you’ve had plenty of experiences managing stressful projects.***

***Yes, I’ve definitely had my fair share. Lastly, I’ve learned that building executive support is vital. Share the good, the bad and the ugly throughout the project. It builds executive trust and support in good and difficult times.***
