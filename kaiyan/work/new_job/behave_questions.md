# Behave_questions

# I.Behavioral interview questions and the STAR technique
> Behavioral interview questions [行为面试问题] focus on how you handled various work situations in the past. Your response will reveal your skills, abilities, and personality. Answers to behavioral interview questions should be in the form of a brief anecdote /'ænɪkdot/ [n.简短故事] that illustrates your strengths and skills as a worker.

> The STAR technique is a useful strategy for responding to interview questions that require an anecdote. It’s an excellent way to organize your thoughts[梳理思路]. There are four steps using this technique:

# 1.(S) Situation
> Describe the situation in which the event took place.

# 2.(T) Task
> Describe the task you were asked to complete. If there was a particular problem or issue you were trying to solve, describe that here.

# 3.(A) Action
> Explain what action you took to complete the task or solve the problem.

# 4.(R) Results
> Explain the result of your actions. For example, if your actions resulted in completing a task, resolving a conflict[解了一个冲突], improving your company’s sales record, etc., explain this. Try to focus on how your actions resulted in a success for the company.

# II.grammar
# 1.One’’s (fair) share
> "fair share" is a phrase that gets used a lot when talking about our past experiences, let’s take a minute to break it down.[在谈论过去经验时常用的词]

> 1) The first is very literal and logical: one’s equal part. It can be a share of things that we often have with others in common: benefits such as profits, or responsibilities such as chores.[第一层是字面意思，就是某人应该做或应得的部分，比如表示利润或任务]

> 2)The next level of meaning however is where this phrase gets more interesting. That’s because the "share" that we are referring to is almost always something negative. You will hear people talk about having their "fair share of disappointments", or their "fair share of heartaches". Again, it doesn’t necessarily have to be negative, but it almost always is.

> 3)You don’t actually need to say the word "fair". You could say "my share", and the meaning would still be clear. However, you might have noticed by now that English native speakers love rhyming, and we often use rhymes as a way to stress or emphasize ideas.[现在很多英语母语者讲话追求押韵，这样可以起到强调作用.]

- 1. Life has its fair share of painful times. How you deal with them is how you grow as a person. [人生不如意十有八九，你的应对方式反映你为人处世的层次。]

- 2. Sure, I’ve seen my fair share of ups and downs, but I’ve always tried to stay positive. [我历经起伏，但一直尽力保持积极态度。]

- 3. At my last job, my team had a few wins, but also our fair share of setbacks. [我的上一份工作里，团队虽然也有过一些成就，但挫败的体会也不少。]

# 2.aggressive [adj.有压迫性的]
> 1)When we use it to talk about people. it could mean angry or violent.He's aggressive person,or any kind of animal. That's an aggressive dog.

- Although he was aggressive as a boy,he grew up to be a very gentle man.

- The latest report shows that deaths from aggressive driving [开斗气车] are up 50% this year.

> 2)But here, we're using it more, to me, like just really difficult.it's like the deadline is fighting you.

> 3)other ways we would use aggressive in this sense would be at the hospital.

- Cancer is an incredibly aggressive disease[极具侵袭性的疾病],but we must not give up the fight against it.

- A rare and aggressive form of sarcoma /sɑr'komə/.[这是一种罕见的恶性肿瘤。]

# 3.on the ball about sth [phr.机警谨慎] & sidetracked [adj.分心的]
> So when you're on the ball about something, you're basically focused on something.  You're not missing anything. You're not sidetracked.I imagining, like he's balancing on a ball, he's not making any mistakes, he's really focused.

# 4.implementing [v.实施] & vague /veɡ/ [adj. 不明确的；含糊的] & speech mode  
> 1)Implementing is kind of a formal word, just means start some kind of plan.Like often you'll see in the news that the government is implementing some new policy or new law.

> 2)You know, we really kind of hear, he's been very polite and kind of reserved up to this point.It does kind of sound like he's giving a speech here, and one of the ways in which he makes it sound like a speech is he doesn't say things like "I need to hold the entire team accountable"or "I should". He just says "hold them…"

# 5.hold the entire team accountable [phr.让某人负责]
> 1)it just means make sure that they take responsibility.so we often use the verb "hold" somebody accountable, but you could be accountable to your boss. That means you're responsible for your work.And so the boss could hold you responsible or hold you accountable. Let's see! You didn't do your work and your boss fires you.Or punishes you in some way. That's them holding you accountable. 

> 2)if there's some big crisis or an accident, always the leaders, the politicians are looking to hold somebody accountable.

# 6.techniques [n.技术] & skills
> 1)"technique" is a little more specific than just skill.And now that I think about it in terms of flying a plane. I think actually most of flying a plane at this point is computerized. I think about like going to an air show.When you see the plane like make circles in the sky.And many planes flying together to make a shape.But everyone is going to have their own individual techniques.And when you are practising a musical instrument or practising how to fly a plane, you can't really skip a lot of these techniques.Right, you really gotta focus on them.

Usually it's because of some other problem.something intentional or purposeful you will wait in order to get some kind of benefit.you may postpone /po'spon/ [v.延期], you could even say.deferring is just kind of wait, like an investor will defer until his investment is big enough that he can be rich.

> 2)at a company, there are a lot of important decisions to be made. Sometimes, you know, I don't want to make those decisions, so I can defer to my boss.it's sort of like passing it on.

> 3)we always talk about delays at the airport or on the train or you know anytime that it's kind of not your intention to wait.you might have to delay the concert or postpone the concert.

# 9.parallel [adj.并行的] activities [phr.并行活动]
> 1)So it just means two lines that are running in the same direction. They do not meet.They do not meet. But like two roads, for example.So if you're giving someone directions, they say "how do I get to Richard's street", and you could tell them "well, it runs parallel to whatever some other street."

> 2)parallel activities:And in this case, activities kind of has the same sense. It's... Two teams or two activities, they're being done at the same time, but they're not kind of interacting with each other.

# 10.market segments [n.部分] & parts
> The words are fairly interchangeable.I mean also you wouldn't really say market parts. 

# 11.interdependent [adj.彼此依赖的] & independent [adj.独立的, 自主的]
> 1)so we just talked about parallel activities. They are not interdependent. That means they don't rely on each other. they are independent, or I'm sure they're not completely independent, but they certainly are not interdependent.

# 13.fair share [phr.相当的份额]

> 2)What we often say I've had my fair share of ups and down.Meaning I have kind of experienced everything.

# III.pattern
***Josh, I’m sure you often have to work under pressure and manage aggressive deadlines. Can you describe how you handle these situations?***

***Of course, Katherine. I’d say that first and foremost as a product manager, you simply need to have strong project management skills and be extremely on the ball about implementing them.***

***Can you be more specific?***

***Yes. Hold the entire team accountable for status reporting, risk management, change control and other project management techniques. You can’t be lazy and skip them.***

***Kill issues as soon as they arise. Don’t let it become something bigger or fester over time. Issue management is a daily function.***

***Be flexible and have the big picture in mind. Very often, you need to defer some activities to make sure the more important ones get done first.***

***Embrace parallel activities. Break the project into segments and identify things that are not interdependent. Do them in parallel.***

***That’s certainly very important.***

***And communicate. In fact, over-communicate. Use both formal and informal channels to make sure everyone is on the same page.***

***Well, Josh, I can tell you’ve had plenty of experiences managing stressful projects.***

***Yes, I’ve definitely had my fair share. Lastly, I’ve learned that building executive support is vital. Share the good, the bad and the ugly throughout the project. It builds executive trust and support in good and difficult times.***
