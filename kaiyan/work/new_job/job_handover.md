***Hey Krista, so just to be clear, did you receive all my emails?***

***Yes, I got about 5 or 6 different emails and I’ve already looked through all the attachments.***

***Okay, well do you have any questions?***

***I do, mainly questions concerning my duties and responsibilities. Do I need to contact clients every week?***

***Yes, you do! At Kacey Jones, we like to make our clients feel as if they can communicate with us whenever, so sending a weekly email reinforces that message.***

*** Got it! And will you be making an introduction email or should I just email them myself?***

***Don’t worry about that. I’ll make an intro email and CC you on it. I’ll try to send it out to everyone a week before I leave. By the way, did you receive all 26 sales contracts?***

***Yes, I did.***

***Great! I’ll also send you some files on my sales leads. I would suggest just cold calling them.***

*** Now, here’s a paper copy of my day-to-day activities. I’ve summarized my daily and weekly goals and what preparation I do in between. You’ve already received a copy of this via email. Let me know if you have any questions.***

***Everything is crystal clear. So, Devin I hope you don’t mind if I ask, but why are you leaving?***

***To be frank, I really love what I do and the people I work with, but I can’t stand the long hours. I found a part-time job with another company. My new office will be close to home and I’ll get to spend more time with my kids.***

***What a true family man! I’m the opposite, a total workaholic!***

***That’s exactly what this position requires…Oh, before I forget let me send an email with all my contact details. If you have any questions about anything, just shoot me an email.***

***I appreciate it, Devin. Also, thanks for scheduling this handover meeting! You’ve been extremely helpful!***
