# I.Best questions to ask in a job interview
> As your job interview comes to a close, one of the final questions you may be asked is, "Do you have any questions for me?"Your interviewer will expect you to have some inquiries. Not asking any questions could make you seem unprepared or disinterested[不感兴趣], so take the time to have some questions of your own ready to ask the hiring manager.

# 1.Make a list of questions to ask at the interview
> Asking questions is a great way to dig into [深入了解] the company culture and the specific day-to-day responsibilities of the job[日常工作职责]. Should you be hired, your first week in the position won't be accompanied by any major surprises[不会遇到什么特别出乎意料的情况] if the proper questions are asked.[如果你问的问题全面充分]

# 2.Best questions to ask the interviewer
- What is the company's management style?

- Who does this position report to?

- How is success evaluated in this role?

- How many people work in this department?

- How much travel is expected?

# 3.Questions NOT to ask at a job interview

- What does this company do? (Do your research ahead of time!)

- If I get the job, when can I take time off for vacation? (Wait until you get the offer.)

- Did I get the job? (Don't be impatient. They'll let you know.)

# II.grammar
# 1. rein /ren/ & full rein [phr.充分的自主权] & full reign /ren/ [n.& vi. 统治]
> 1)rein refers to like the ropes on a horse.when you're pulling on a horse, you gotta change direction, you gotta pull on the reins.Pull on the reins, or rein something in, rein the house in.

> 2) reign: it's got a silent "g", and that word is related to having power over a country.Or something. Right, or something. It means to rule something.So you could say "full rein" in the correct way. Or you could say it "full" reign", and it kinda has a similar meaning. It means you have freedom to do whatever you want.

- 1. "the reins" – power or control over an activity the reins  [对一项活动的权力或控制] 

- 2. give free/full rein" – be completely free to do as you please give free/full rein [自由发挥，想做什么就做什么]

- 3. keep a tight rein on sth" – to control something carefully keep a tight rein on sth [小心地控制某事]

- 4. The successor was handed the reins by the previous CEO. [将权力移交给了下一任] 

- 5. My boss gave me full rein over how we proceed with the project. [充分的自主权来运行这个项目]

- 6. Try to keep a tight rein on our budget. We don't want to go overboard like last year. [设法严格控制我们的预算。我们不想像去年那样超支]

# 2.covered all the bases [phr.涵盖全部] & broaden its reach [phr.扩大范围]
> 1）so this is in baseball. Yeah. A fielder, someone who's gonna hopefully catch the ball, they have to cover a base. It just means they have to watch it and like keep an eye on it.So when you say that you have covered all of the bases, it really means that you've done all that you need to do.you've prepared for anything, for any situation that you might encounter.

> 2)What's broaden your reach is definitely like increase the amount of people that you connect with.We can use it with other words like you can broaden your scope, or you can broaden your horizon /hə'raɪzn/.

# 3.composition [n.组成、作曲 ]
> 1）You can compose /kəm'poz/ [v.组成 & vt. & vi. 创作(乐曲、诗歌等)] a song and that means it's a composition. it is composed of musical parts.It's arranged.

> 2)the arrangement or the composition will be things like you know product managers and developers. It's just what are all the parts.

# 4.chunk & fixed phrases & set phrases
> It's a group of words that don't change and usually have a single meaning. They're sometimes called "fixed phrases" or "set phrases". Here are a few examples: by the way, all in all, do you know what I mean. Chunks can be grammatical patterns or idioms, and can be long or short.

# 5.higher-ups
> The higher ups [上司], the C-suite [高管], the senior management, these are all pretty interchangeable /ˌɪntɚ'tʃendʒəbl/ [adj.可交换的], depending on the company.

# 6.micromanage [v.微观管理]
> this just means that you're kind of controlling everything.every small detail.especially after you've already delegated that work to somebody else.I think a micromanager, a person who micromanages, their biggest problem is that they don't delegate or they are unwilling to delegate.

# 7.execution /ˌɛksɪ'kjuʃən/  [n. 依法处决 & n.执行]
> 1)So when you first see this word, at least when I do, you might think like killing. 

> 2)but it also has this totally other meaning, it means to do something. But especially something you plan, something that like a big deal or a big plan.n college or something. And of course, you could have a great idea, you could have a great team. But then, when it actually comes to presenting, or doing whatever that project needs to be, if your execution kinda sucks, then you probably won't do very well on that project.So you can use it a lot in different ways, you can execute a computer program. 

# 8.vision & core belief [n.核心理念]
> 1)another question that is probably really safe to ask in an interview is about the vision. What's the vision?What's your goals? Where are you going with this product?

> 2)The core beliefs, Yeah. So, the core, that's just the central part, the most important part. So core belief, we also say things like core values. You know, in their business, they probably have a few core operations.the core belief at Beneflex, the company that we have been following for the past few lessons is kind of one of connectivity, right? A lot of silicon valley companies, this is really their core belief, they want to connect people, or they, or they feel that people should be connected.

# 9.collaborative /kə'læbəretɪv/ [adj.] & cooperative /ko'ɑpərətɪv/ [adj.]
> 1)Usually collaborate is, it's not as general as cooperate.collaborate usually implies like a deeper, stronger type of working together.Connection like the actual exchange of ideas…And accepting those ideas and changing based on those ideas.

> 2)Cooperate just means work together. You don't need to know the person, you don't need to care about the person at work.You just to be polite and keep going working together.

# 10.front and center [以...为核心]
> 1)so this is a great expression that means make it or treat it really important.You have to put you users first like we always do here.you're going to put the listener front and center.

> 2)one thing about this phrase, put someone or something front and center, it's not necessarily a chunk. The chunk is front and center.You could change the verb, right? you can't keep something front and center.
