# I.Rules for negotiating a job offer
> Job-offer negotiations are rarely easy[求职谈判并非易事]. But job market complexity creates opportunities for people who can skillfully negotiate the terms and conditions of employment.[能够熟练谈判工作条款和条件的人就有了进退的余地] Here are some helpful rules.

# 1.Help them understand why you deserve.
> It's not enough for them to like you. They also have to believe you're worth the offer you want. Don't just state your desire (a 15% higher salary); explain precisely why it's justified (the reasons you deserve more money than others they may have hired).

# 2.Understand the person across the table.
> You have to understand the person sitting opposite you. What are his/her interests and individual concerns? You can perhaps afford to pepper HR with questions regarding details of the offer, but you don't want to annoy someone who may become your manager with seemingly petty demands.[但是你绝不会想用琐碎要求，惹恼可能成为你主管的人。]

# 3.Be prepared for tough questions.
> Many job candidates have been hit with difficult questions: Do you have any other offers? If we make you an offer tomorrow, will you say yes? The point is this: You need to prepare for questions and issues that would make you feel uncomfortable, or expose your weaknesses. Your goal is to answer honestly without looking like an unattractive candidate.[你的目标是诚实回答这些问题，同时也要看上去很有吸引力。]

# II.grammar
# 1.强调句型
>  So we often use this in situations where it kind of seems that one thing that we're saying and the other thing that we're saying are opposite.Yeah, exactly. And here's an example, "I do want to go, but I'm just so tired."

> The verb “do” can be used as a helping verb to emphasize the main verb, usually for the purpose of contrasting it with something said or about to be said. this construction is often used before or after a “but” clause, and is most common in spoken English. For pronunciation, the “do,” “does” or “did” is always stressed when using it in this way.[do用作对比，经常用在“but（但是）”引导的从句之前或之后,英语口语中非常常见。do、does或did用作对比时，需要重读.]

- 1. I do want to help you, but I just don't have enough time. 

- 2. A: Sally is not a friendly coworker. B: But she does work really hard. 

- 3. We did like the apartment, but the location was pretty bad. 

# 2.salary structure [n.薪资结构] & base salary [n.底薪] & performance bonus [n.绩效奖金] & compensation package [n.薪酬包，薪酬组合]
> 1) So a structure is a building, but it just really means how something is organized or how it's arranged. Even companies have a very complicated structure. 

> 2) so the base salary is going to be probably the most of your salary, the biggest part of your salary. But there's going to be other things on top of it.And because it's the bottom, it's the base. It's the most important part, and that's all the money that you're guaranteed to get as long as you do your job.

> 3) Just be careful here, "performance" here is not talking about like a musical or song.it's just how well you do. It could be a company or even a machine.Right, if something is not performing well, it could be broken.

> 4)package is something wrapped up that has lots of pieces in it.All together. So this compensation package really just means what is the company giving you in exchange for your work.So, you don't even really need to be at a company. You could be babysitting your neighbor's kids and you will get compensation for that. You will get money for your time.

# 3.heavy on (the) sth  [phr.主要部分在] & light on the sth [phr....太少了]
> 1）it's like a big part of it. In any case, when we use the phrase "heavy on something" or even "heavy on the something," we just mean that that is a big part of it.it could just mean there's too much, like if I order some food and there's too much, I don't know, sugar or salt or cheese?if you go to Starbucks and order one of their fancy drinks, a lot of them are really heavy on the sugar.

> 2) in that case, I want a lot of cheese. So maybe I'm gonna say, "This is a little light on the cheese."

# 4.HR /ˌeɪtʃˈɑːr/.

# 5.professional development [n.职业发展]
> So professional, of course, when I think of the word professional, I think about a nice shirt.White-collar jobs, right? So you know a professional could be a lawyer, could be an accountant, could be anything. The point is when you are professional, you want to develop.

# 6.seminars /'seminɑ:/ [n.研讨会] & conference
> 1)seminars : so this is like a conference right? It's when professionals, they meet to study something. A seminar might be an event that they are holding at the conference. And often the people attend a seminar, and an expert will maybe give a seminar, maybe he's teaching the seminar?Right. So he's going to be talking in maybe a group of twenty people about some topic. like maybe a bunch of dentists are gathering together, and some expert dentists show some new technique.

> 2)conference: when I think about a conference I think about like, all of the rooms at a hotel. There are hundreds and hundreds of people that are at this conference.

# III.pattern
***Hi Jeremy. Have you given more thought to the job offer?***

***Absolutely. It's a very generous offer, but I do have some questions and concerns.***

***Okay, what in particular? Is it the annual leave?***

***No, I'm happy with two weeks of paid vacation. The issue is the salary structure. The base salary is lower than I expected.***

***Yes, it is heavy on the performance bonus[工资主要在绩效奖金]. We can probably adjust that for you. Just send me a number and I'll forward it to HR.***

***Thanks. That'd be great. Also, are there any opportunities for professional development included in the compensation package[薪酬福利待遇中是否有可能包含职业发展培训]?***

***There is. We provide support for continuing education programs[继续教育项目], skill-based training[技能培训], as well as conferences and seminars. Anything else?***

***No, everything else looks great. I'm really excited to join the team.***

***Okay, I'll get HR to draw up a new contract.***
