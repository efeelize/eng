*** Jake, thank you for coming. Since your contract is almost up, I want to talk to you about renewing it.***

***Ok, let’s talk.***

***I know you’ve expressed interest in staying with us and we’d love to have you here as well. So I’d just like to hear your opinion on the matter.***

***Well, I am really happy here and I would love to stay longer. But I would like to see what the company is proposing for me if I stay here.***

***Since you’ve been with us for one year, we think it’s time we give you more responsibilities.***

***Will these responsibilities come with a raise?***

***Unfortunately, we are trying to control costs and we can’t offer you a raise at the time.***

*** But more responsibilities usually include a raise, especially if I’m re-signing for another year.***

***Well besides the additional work you’ll be carrying out, why else do you believe you deserve a raise?***

***Well, I have done a lot of hard work in the past year. I usually help out others who are running late on deadlines. I also meet my deadlines and try to participate in as many company workshops and events as possible.***

***Well you are right about most of these points, but there is always room for improvement. I have had a few complaints from some of your clients and I believe you can step it up a notch when it comes to working with them.***

***Look, Jake, as I mentioned before we are trying to control cost here. The market is at the same level it was when you joined the company; if it had changed we might have more of an ability to give you a raise. I believe we are investing in you by giving you more learning opportunities and a chance for developing some new skills.***

***I understand where you are coming from, but I already have an offer with another company. I’m being offered the same job for more money. I would much rather work here, but I was hoping my performance and loyalty could get some recognition.***

***Ok, I can’t offer you a raise, but I can offer you something different. How about a performance-based bonus? I’ll think of some metrics for bettering your client-service skills. We can come up with an incentive plan for reaching those goals, including bonuses as a reward.***

***Ok, that’s something I’d consider.***
