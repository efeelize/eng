There is no pre-determined list of correct modifications /ˌmɑdɪfɪ'keʃən/ [没有预设的正确描述方式]; it can be used somewhat flexibly with any word or words that draw attention to the behavior that is being mocked.

> so don't get out something on me, now you can use this for someone is trying to I don't know,lecture you, and you don't think it's necessarily helpful.exactly and you can almost you can there some words that follow are more common than others, but you can use it really with a lot of things you could say like don't get all snappy /'snæpi/ [(用于催促)赶紧,快点] with me like meaning don't don't be anger.

# II.pattern
***Phil, you look a little out of it. You ok?***

***Oh, hey–yeah, I guess I'm pretty distracted. It’s all this news about the layoffs. The rumors are pretty grim.***

***Yeah, I’ve been hearing the same. I feel badly for anyone at Nokia, and would love to say the worst is over for us too, but we’re not out of the woods yet.***

***Yeah–there’s the 12,000 from Nokia–but we’re in the line of fire for the other 6,000! Aren’t you worried? I think we all expected Microsoft to trim some fat once the Nokia acquisition was announced, but this is crazy! Why aren’t you freaking out?***

***Honestly, I’ve been down this road before in the financial crisis of 2007 – and as nerve-wracking as it may be, getting laid off wasn’t the end of the world for me. In fact, it was probably a good thing in the long run. Not to sound cliche, but I honestly think it was the universe getting me to move on…***

***Oh, please–don’t get all New-Agey on me. I’d rather shoot straight and say it like it is. This is not about fate, or the universe. That many people losing their livelihood is just bad no matter how you cut it.***

***I know, but ultimately, getting laid-off was a good thing for me. The company I worked for ended up folding just last year anyway. I can tell you right now, no one got a severance package like I did when that happened–they were just out on the street.***

***Fine–but I worked hard to get here because Microsoft is supposed to be the Mecca of the tech world. It’s too big to fail - so I thought I had it made for the rest of my career.***

***Look, it’s bad. I know. But c'est la vie. The best safeguard anyone can have is to actually be a hard- working, good performer when the heads start to roll–and I think we both are in that category.***

***You’re right–we both lead in sales last year, so that’s good. But I don’t think I’m like you. I can’t just sit on my hands in the meantime. Between you and me, I’m already looking for greener pastures.***
