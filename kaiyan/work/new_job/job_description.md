# III.pattern
***Hey Katie, I have a question. I have an open position in my department that I got approval to fill. Can you give me some pointers on writing a job description so I can get this posted? I figured, as HR Manager, you're my best bet!***

***Sure, of course. Let me see what you have so far. Uh huh…. Ok, this looks good. It looks like you have the basics – job title, department, a good overview of the position…***

***Yea, I need to include a lot more information though, don’t I?***

***Yes. You summarized the overall purpose of the job well in your overview. Now you need to write about the key responsibilities of the position. This is where you explain the day-to-day of the job.***

***Ok, I can handle that.***

***Be sure to list them in order of importance. Oh, and I usually add "other duties as assigned" at the end of this section in case special projects come up in the future.***

***That's a good idea! Ok and then after that I should go over the position qualifications, shouldn't I?***

***Yea, this is where you list out the minimum requirements. These should include education, previous experience, communication skills, technical skills, any licenses or certifications you may require and so on.***

***Ok. Wow, this is so helpful. You're a lifesaver, Katie! I think I got it now. There isn't anything else I need to know, is there?***

***Umm…. Oh, one last thing. Unless it's a specialized, high-paying position, I recommend just putting "competitive salary" down for the pay. This will give you more flexibility to consider a wider range of candidates. And be brief about our benefits offered, but it's worth mentioning!***

***Makes sense. Ok, got it. Thank you so much for your time and help Katie!***
