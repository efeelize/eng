# Positive mind

# I.Positive psychology [积极心理学]
> Today's lesson is based on the idea of positive psychology[积极心理学], one of the newest fields [最新领域] in psychology. Much like the saying, "An ounce /aʊns/ [少量] of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"[预防为主，治疗为辅] this branch [分支] of psychology focuses on effective intervention /ˌɪntɚ'vɛnʃən/ [有效预防] and utilizes scientific understanding to increase mental well-being[利用科学改善健康状况], rather than treating mental illness.[而不是治疗疾病]

> There have been countless studies[无数科学研究证明了] showing the many benefits of practising gratitude on mental health[感恩的心态]. It improves the emotional, social, health, personality, and even career aspects of our lives. 

# II.Start your day with a positive mind
> When we wake up each morning, we often start our day without much conscious /'kɑnʃəs/ [adj.神志清醒的] thought about how we are feeling and what our intentions are for the day.What if, instead, we took a few minutes to consciously think about the day ahead of us? Start the day by being appreciative and grateful for what the world has to offer and what we have in our own lives.

> Often, there are things in life, which are not the way we want them to be. And that could create challenges and frustrations. But a small change in perception and approach could lead to a positive change in how we see and deal with challenges in the future. Morning is a wonderful time to create a new approach on how we see the world.It's like New Year's Day each morning: the ability to think anew /ə'nʊ/ [adv.再,重新].So start every day with positive and grateful thoughts.

# III.grammar
# 1. positive
> 1) It contains the Latin root, "posit," which means "placed,"[安置] so it originally referred to laws as being "laid down" firmly without question[毫无疑义], leading to the eventual /ɪˈvɛntʃuəl/ [adj.(事件)最终发生的] meaning of "very sure." So, if someone asks you, "Are you sure?", you can reply, "Positive."

> 2)positive : mean "good" and "optimistic."
