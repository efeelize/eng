# Positive mind

# I.Positive psychology [积极心理学]
> Today's lesson is based on the idea of positive psychology[积极心理学], one of the newest fields [最新领域] in psychology. Much like the saying, "An ounce /aʊns/ [少量] of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"[预防为主，治疗为辅] this branch [分支] of psychology focuses on effective intervention /ˌɪntɚ'vɛnʃən/ [有效预防] and utilizes scientific understanding to increase mental well-being[利用科学改善健康状况], rather than treating mental illness.[而不是治疗疾病]

> There have been countless studies[无数科学研究证明了] showing the many benefits of practising gratitude on mental health[感恩的心态]. It improves the emotional, social, health, personality, and even career aspects of our lives. 

# II.Start your day with a positive mind
> When we wake up each morning, we often start our day without much conscious /'kɑnʃəs/ [adj.神志清醒的] thought about how we are feeling and what our intentions are for the day.What if, instead, we took a few minutes to consciously think about the day ahead of us? Start the day by being appreciative and grateful for what the world has to offer and what we have in our own lives.

> Often, there are things in life, which are not the way we want them to be. And that could create challenges and frustrations. But a small change in perception and approach could lead to a positive change in how we see and deal with challenges in the future. Morning is a wonderful time to create a new approach on how we see the world.It's like New Year's Day each morning: the ability to think anew /ə'nʊ/ [adv.再,重新].So start every day with positive and grateful thoughts.

# III.grammar
# 1. positive
> 1) It contains the Latin root, "posit," which means "placed,"[安置] so it originally referred to laws as being "laid down" firmly without question[毫无疑义], leading to the eventual /ɪˈvɛntʃuəl/ [adj.(事件)最终发生的] meaning of "very sure." So, if someone asks you, "Are you sure?", you can reply, "Positive."

> 2)positive : mean "good" and "optimistic."

- 1. Are you positive [确定] you wired /waɪrd/ [转账] the landlord [房东] the security deposit [押金] last week? 

- 2. He has such a positive outlook on life [人生观特别积极] that everyone likes hanging out with him. 

- 3. I was positive [很确定] I didn't get the job, but two days later I received an offer! 

- 4. After our client gave us positive feedback, we began building the prototype /'protə'taɪp/ [n.原型]. 

# 2.conscious [adj.意识到，有意识的] & unconscious /ʌn'kɑnʃəs/ [adj.失去知觉的] & subconscious /ˌsʌb'kɑnʃəs/ [adj.下意识、潜意识的] & consciously [adv.]
> 1)Conscious means that you're actually aware or you are actually, you know, doing something on purpose.basically "conscious" means that, yeah, like you said, aware.

> 2)unconscious is asleep[adj.睡着的、麻木的].or like being knocked out.If you're in a boxing match. Someone hits you in the head too many times.

> 3)subconscious:That's more like psychological[adj.心理学上的].It's like deep down. Yeah, you might be thinking about it but you don't know you're thinking about it. 

> 4)consciously is when you're conscious about something, you're consciously thinking about something. You pretty much.that's doing something on purpose.

# 3.perception [n.看法、概念]
> Perception is how you see or hear or...To have perception or, you know, how you see something is also how you perceive /pɚ'siv/ [vt.察觉,感觉] something.

# 4.turn over a new leaf [重新开始] & anew [adv.重新]
> 1）turn over a new leaf means to, basically, make a change for the better.

> 2)"anew" is just an adverb that we use to say, you know, start thinking in a new way.have fresh new wonderful thoughts.And even just going back to that New Year's idea, like the idea, that on January 1st. You can begin life anew.

# 5.gratitude [n.] & grateful [adj.] & appreciate & unfulfilled [adj.没有成就感的] & unappreciate [adj.不被赏识的] & appreciative [adj.感恩的、珍惜的] & grateful [adj.感激的]
> 1)so gratitude has a close relative, which is "grateful." You can say, "I am grateful," "she is grateful," "we are all grateful." But the noun "gratitude," like Johnny says, we usually show it or express it.

> 2)if you show gratitude, you're showing that person how happy, how appreciative you are.One thing we really want to stress, though, is that when you're saying this, you need to say what you are so appreciative of. So you can't just say, "I appreciate." You need to say either, "I appreciate the bonus. I appreciate your generosity" or just simply, "I appreciate it."

> 3)unappreciated, it just means that you feel like nobody has given you any recognition.

> 4)unfulfilled, yeah, you just feel like you're not getting enough of something. So this could be recognition, could be free time, could be, a lot, lot of different things could leave you feeling unfulfilled.

> 5)To be appreciative, grateful or thankful.Of course we use this word but it's much more common to use it in another form, "appreciate". Like if you're actually telling something, like, for example, Spencer wasn't supposed to come in today, he did come in today. So, hopefully, someone says: "Thanks man, I appreciate it."

> 6)I think maybe "grateful" is a little more appreciative than "appreciative".but it wouldn't be something you would say, like to someone, like if, you know, Spencer helped me at work. I wouldn't say I'm grateful. You know, it would sound kind of strange."grateful" is more like for some bigger things.So for example, the one we just used, you could say "oh, I'm appreciative", you know, "I appreciate that you came in for work today". But you could say, you know, I was really grateful for the way my parents raised me.
