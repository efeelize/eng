# I.Crowdfunding:then and now
> Although the term crowdfunding first appeared in August of 2006, the idea of crowdfunding has actually been around for centuries. Authors and publishers used to advertise about future book projects, and would complete the book if enough subscribers signaled a willingness to purchase it after it was ready. However, modern day crowdfunding is different in that the flow of funding starts before the project is completed.

> Crowdfunding first became popular on the internet in the music and arts industries in 1997. Crowdfunding companies like GlobalGiving and DonorsChoose started sprouting up by the year 2000.

> To date, the highest-grossing crowdfunding campaign was Star Citizen, a combat video game, which raised a whopping $156 million. Previous to that, the highest-earning campaign was Pebble Watch, a line of smartwatches, which grossed just over $10 million. In 2015 alone, it is estimated that over USD $34 billion was raised using crowdfunding platforms.

***Jonathan, thanks for coming today; after receiving your investor deck and business plan, we’re eager to hear more about your company.***

***Mark, I'm thrilled to be here. Today I'd like to introduce you to the BetterBright: an industrial-strength lightbulb that uses no electricity! BetterBright's goal is to make the world a brighter place through environmental sustainability and radical innovation.***

***That sounds impossible. Do you have a working prototype?***

***We do - but let's not get ahead of ourselves. As you can see, the team behind BetterBright is a diverse group of engineers and biologists. The credentials of our team are unparalleled in the industry.***

***It’s an impressive team. Tell me about your target market.***

***Because this technology is so new and advanced, scalable production is only possible for high-end,industrial users. Our target market is industrial manufacturing sites, where energy costs and usage play a significant role in overheads.***

***What about competitors and barriers to entry?***

***Because we use a sophisticated, patented technology, barriers to entry are extremely high. Direct and indirect competition exist in other lighting solutions, but no other technology claims the same level of energy savings.***

***So, you feel you have a sustainable competitive advantage?***

***Yes. The team that developed this product is incredibly difficult to recreate, and the patents we have secured make BetterBright very difficult to replicate, and substitute technologies are rare.***

***Have you secured a previous capital raise? And what is the plan for the use of proceeds?***

***Previous capital raise included a startup infusion from an angel investor, but we are seeking an additional $50 million in VC investment for this round. The use of proceeds will go towards manufacturing infrastructure that will allow us to scale production to achieve full market penetration.***

***What is your exit strategy?***

***We expect that once sales show market viability, we will be acquired by a major energy conglomerate.***

***This sounds like a very promising opportunity indeed!***

# IV.pattern
***Hey, Darren. How's the new business idea coming along?***

***It's easier said than done. I'm just struggling to find funding.***

***Oh, did you try starting a crowdfunding campaign?***

***No, I didn't. Is that like venture capital funding?***

***Not at all. With crowdfunding, you usually don't have to give away stock options.***

***So how do you raise funds, then?***

***It's literally like an online fundraiser. Take Kickstarter or Indiegogo, for example.***

***Are those crowdfunding platforms?***

***Yeah. You create a page to pitch your product, budget and goal, then supporters back your project with cash pledges.***

***What do these backers get in return?***

***They usually get free products, but you can also assemble royalty financing and even sell ownership stakes.***

***Wow, that takes out the bank as the middleman. It actually sounds pretty doable.***

***For sure! So many great startups have exploded on Kickstarter.***
