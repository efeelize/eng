# I.3 small talk tips for job interviews
# 1. Skip the clichés /'kli:ʃei/  [老套的寒暄]
> Friendly chats about the weather are easy to lean on[依赖]. However, they aren’t very impactful[有效] or memorable[印象深刻]. So, skip the generalities /ˌdʒɛnə'ræləti/ [泛泛而谈] and clichés. You can bet that every other candidate is using those—and you want to be the one to stand out.

# 2. Find a common interest
> You’d have spent some time researching your interviewer before you arrived at the meeting[进行面试前]. Whenever you’re doing that polite digging through his or her social media profile, keep your eyes peeled for [注意到] any common interests you share.

> You can bring up something relevant about yourself [提起这些关于你的话题] when your interviewer asks that inevitable, “How are you?” question. If he or she takes that bait, you’ll be engaged in [上钩接话] an interesting conversation about a shared passion in no time[共同爱好的有趣谈话].

# 3.Comment on something company related
> Of course, you’re there to demonstrate that you’d be a great fit for the company[展现自己非常适合这家公司]. Those little snippets /'snippit/ [n.小片,片段] and peeks [小新闻和小观察] into the company can be an awesome and highly relevant topic of conversation with your interviewer. So, don’t beafraid to use them!

# II.grammar
# 1.find it
> 1）“Find” can be followed by all sorts of pronouns, and the meaning will change slightly with each one. “Find it” is usually used to express your feelings about a situation, and so you could think of the “it” as representing “the situation”.[“Find”后面可以连接各种各样的代词，而含义会因代词的不同而稍有变化。“Find it”通常用来表达你在某一情况下 的情绪，而你可以将“it”理解为指代“这个情况”.]

> 2)We use this all the time and it kind of means just like what you feel about it,This phrase doesn’t need to be used only to talk about negative situations like in our dialogue. You can also use it to express positive things like “He’s very funny and always finds it easy to make friends”.[这个短语不一定只用来描述负面的情况，比如像我们对话里这样。你还可以用它来描述正面的情况]

> 3)You can also use this phrase in a question to ask how someone is doing in a new situation or environment. Asking “How are you finding it there?” to a friend who has just changed companies or move to a different city is a great way to show that you care about them.[用在疑问句里，来询问某人在一个新情况或者新环境里怎么样。]

- 1. I find it a little hard to believe that you wrote this paper without any help.[你居然在没有任何帮助的情况下写完了这篇论文，我觉得这有点儿难以置信。]

- 2. She told me that she’s finding it difficult to adjust to living in the big city.

# 4.fairly [adv.] & very [adj. & adv.] & quite [adv.]

> 2)But then when we look at the word very, like very, it's a big word.It means a lot of things.

> 1)Yes. Benefactor is like someone who gives money to sponsor, usually like artistic projects.Yeah, yeah, yeah, or like a museum or something.

> 2) So, if you can imagine somebody holding your back, so you don't fall down. It's kind of like they are supporting you.financial supporter could be called a backer.I mean we have politicians who have backers.

> 3)Yeah, it's interesting because you could say these people are supporters as well, but supporters don't necessarily give you money. They're not necessarily financial supporters.

> 4)Backing,it's just it's the money.you can get backing from the government.So just like these content creators who need backing. This company. It was a bunch of independent artists, and they were finding it difficult to, you know, raise money.

# 7.platform /'plæt'fɔrm/ [n.平台] & content creators [n.内容创作者] & contents

You know a place where you can spread your voice or something like that.Right or whatever the app is used for.Yeah, like Youtube, Instagram, almost anything.

> 2)And one thing that Youtube, Instagram, Facebook. All of these platforms need, in order to function, in order to work, our content creators.Right, because that's what they offer essentially, they offer content.Alright, so we get content creators. We're often thinking about blogs, little videos but these people were artists.

> 3)we didn't say content in the same way. Er, content was just like what's it about.Was in like we always say a table of contents.In a book. But now, content is video. It's you know, tweets, it's all of these things.
