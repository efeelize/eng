# Rethinking the 9 to 5 lifestyle

# I.The future of jobs won’t be about 9-to-5 office hours
> The freelance marketplace is exploding, as more companies seek to hire freelancers as a way to snag /snæɡ/ [v.钩住、留住] the best talent. Yet many companies still hold strong to the traditional 9-to-5 workday. According to Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel, remote work will be the norm [常态] within the next 10 years, as younger generations take the management reins[接手管理权].

> People notice that place-bound work [固定地点的工作] no longer makes sense. Collaboration technologies[协作技术], like Microsoft’s Office 365, Slack, Google Hangouts and Atlassian, along with the ability to find work online via sites like ours, make it possible to work anywhere. The number of U.S. freelancers [自由职业者] who found projects online increased 22 points in the past five years - from 42 percent in 2014 to 64 percent in 2018.

> While technology is the main enabler[推动因素], another major force is hiring pain [招聘的痛苦] and huge talent shortages[巨大的人才短缺]. The most talented professionals are increasingly used to being able to call the shots [做主] and shape their lives [塑造自己的生活] as they want to live them rather than as traditional 9-to-5 work requires. This means companies who want access to them need to allow remote work.

# III.pattern
***Carol, I think I've had enough of this whole 9 to 5 thing. It's so soul-sucking[让人心力交瘁啦]!***

***Oh come on, Dean, it's not all that bad. There are so many perks to this job -- generous annual leave, retirement and health care.***

***Meh, sounds like you're ok with day in, day out monotony[日复一日的单调]. I, on the other hand, feel like I'm wasting my best years here. I'm also getting tired of always being on someone else's time.[由别人安排我的时间]***

***I heard management is considering a flextime policy. And what you find monotony[单调] in, I find structure and security[有条理、有安全感]. Plus, my routine here allows me to practice my craft[提高] and improve my skills everyday.***

***Flextime isn't good enough for me, and as for that routine, I feel quite the opposite. All I ever do here is unfulfilling busywork[不称心的琐碎工作]. I'd be happy to give up that security to pursue my passions.***

***You're not the only one: tons of people like you are foregoing the 9 to 5 to suit their own needs and take greater control of their work destiny.***

***Looks like I'll be next to join the club. Freelancing, here I come!***
