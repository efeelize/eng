***Hey, Chris, I’m thinking of quitting my job to find something more flexible.***

***Really? You just started there a year ago. Are you sure you’re not job hopping for a pay bump?[想加薪而跳槽]***

***Yeah, and I’m not getting antsy or anything[不是急着要加薪]. The job just doesn’t give me any autonomy.***

***I hear you, but this is the second time you’ve quit after a year. Potential employers aren’t going to like a resume peppered with different jobs.[换来换去的求职简历]***

***I agree. But on the other hand, loyalty doesn’t pay off, either. I could negotiate a better deal at a new company.***

***That may be, although if you stick it out with your current employer, you’ve got the edge over external candidates filling positions there.[肯定会比想得到职位的外部候选人更占优势]***

***Oh, I hadn’t thought about that, actually. Don’t get me wrong. Showing commitment is important to me.[我也是个讲诚信的人]***

***The other thing is that you may not get variety, but you’ll become more vested in the future success if you stick around.***

***That’s true, as long as you don’t get complacent.***

***If you’re feeling like that, you can talk to your manager and see how you can shake things up[是否能做些改变] or take on new responsibilities.***

***Hmm, maybe I should give this a little more thought.***

***Good idea. Nobody said navigating a career path was easy.***
