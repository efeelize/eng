And you can't drive a car and look at the map at the same time.But any case, the person who is beside you in the car, they are usually the navigator. They are the ones that will look at the map.

A pay off, a lot of us in life are still waiting for our pay off.you know you work thirty, forty years, probably more like fifty years, and then you have this great retirement and then you know, you go travel and take pictures… That's the pay off.

# 5.actiona
## 1)keep up & stick it out /around [phr.坚持下去]  
> 1)"Keep it up" just means keep going. it often happens if you're doing something good, like your boss says, "Oh, good work, keep it up!"

> 3)so "stick it out" is usually in a pretty, you know kind of bad uncomfortable situation with the promise that it's going to get better or "stick around" is just wait.

## 2)got the edge with sth [phr.占据优势]
> So have an edge or get an edge, it just an edge here is is basically like an advantageous position, right? It's an advantage.for sure.

> 2)So you were saying if an employer sees a resume peppered with these different jobs, it looks like that person doesn't have any loyalty."peppered with" in this dialogue does sound kind of negative, right? He's using it in a negative sense.

> 3)But be careful here, because we don't have to use it that way.Yeah, you could pepper a speech with lots of jokes. I mean the whole point is you don't want to say those things all the time, just like in a speech, you wouldn't want to only say jokes. Just the, if there's enough little jokes kind of spread here and there, then it's just the proper amount.

# 7.that may be...but/although... [phr.可能像你说的那样吧]
> When I hear "That may be", it's usually followed by a "but", or here in this case,it's an "although".So it's, it's like I'm, I'm hearing what you're saying, that may be ture,but,you know here's the reason why you're wrong.

# 8.external [adj.外部的] 
> It usually means it's a kind of hard situation, you know, maybe you just like joined a soccer team, and it's really tough - everyone is faster than you, stronger than you, but you really wanted to do it, so just you got to just stick it out, you get better.if you stick it out with your current employer, you've got the edge over other external candidates. so that kind of sounds like a pay off in another self.

# 9.vested [adj.既定的] & vested interest in something & invest 
> 1)in this case, it is a guarantee, it's a guarantee of like future.it's more about like, you know, sharing in the company's interest and kind of, it's like a guarantee.So vested in the future success means that when the company finally gotta go public or get sold and you know, like the employees will have this sort of future claim on that success.cause you put in the work, it could be like stock options or shares or something.

> 2)that's a really good phrase, "vested interest in something". I mean often times when people at the executive level, get a new job, they often get stock options, and that gives them a vested interest in the, you know, the success of the company.

> 3)you'll think about the word "invest", right? They're obviously, they are related.

***Hey, Chris, I’m thinking of quitting my job to find something more flexible.***

***Really? You just started there a year ago. Are you sure you’re not job hopping for a pay bump?[想加薪而跳槽]***

***Yeah, and I’m not getting antsy or anything[不是急着要加薪]. The job just doesn’t give me any autonomy.***

***I hear you, but this is the second time you’ve quit after a year. Potential employers aren’t going to like a resume peppered with different jobs.[换来换去的求职简历]***

***I agree. But on the other hand, loyalty doesn’t pay off, either. I could negotiate a better deal at a new company.***

***That may be, although if you stick it out with your current employer, you’ve got the edge over external candidates filling positions there.[肯定会比想得到职位的外部候选人更占优势]***

***Oh, I hadn’t thought about that, actually. Don’t get me wrong. Showing commitment is important to me.[我也是个讲诚信的人]***

***The other thing is that you may not get variety, but you’ll become more vested in the future success if you stick around.***

***That’s true, as long as you don’t get complacent.***

***If you’re feeling like that, you can talk to your manager and see how you can shake things up[是否能做些改变] or take on new responsibilities.***

***Hmm, maybe I should give this a little more thought.***

***Good idea. Nobody said navigating a career path was easy.***

# III.pattern
***I'm feeling so discontent lately, George. It's time I stepped out of my comfort zone!***

***I know that feeling. If you truly want to leave your comfort zone, you gotta get through the fear zone.***

***Seriously? There are other zones?***

***Yeah, comfort is the first zone. Next is the fear zone. This is when we identify our barriers, face our fears, and break free from our stagnant lives.***

***Makes sense. People often avoid fear, which holds them back. So, after you've conquered the fear zone, what's next?***

***Next is the learning zone. This is when we acquire new skills and expand our comfort zone through our newfound confidence***

***Ahh, sounds like we can initiate big changes in the learning zone.***

***Precisely. But ultimately you want to reach the growth zone.***

***Is that when we use our new skills to find purpose in life and live our dreams?***

***You nailed it. But reaching this zone is easier said than done.***

***So what's the secret to reaching the growth zone?***

***You have to embrace change and be comfortable with being uncomfortable.***
