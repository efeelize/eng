# Resigning_from_a_job
# I.Rules for resignation
> With the average American job tenure /'tɛnjɚ/ [任期] lasting 4.2 years[干一份工作的平均年限], it's expected most of us will part ways with [分道扬镳] an employer 10 or more times during our career. How you exit says a lot about you and can play a big role in securing references [离职方式可以充分说明你的为人] and networking opportunities for future jobs[获得推荐和建立人脉的机会]. Here are two tips for helping you leave a lasting positive impression [持久的正面印象] when you resign.

# 1.Resign to the right person
> It is tempting [往往会] to tell your co-workers first that you are leaving to gain support.[以获得支持] However, for the rest of your career, potential employers are more likely to want to speak with a former manager than a former co-worker[潜在雇主一般更愿意通过你的上一任经理了解你，而非前同事。]. It is both a sign of respect and display of business savvy /'sævi/ [n.悟性] that you speak to the person who hired you first when you have decided to leave.[决定离职的时候，通知第一个雇用你的人既是尊重他的体现，也是你自己商业头脑的表现。]

# 2.Give a reasonable notice and remain productive
> Asking your new employer for a few extra days so that you can honor a two week exit commitment[留出两周办理离职]. Be productive during this notice period unless you want to be remembered as a negative distraction.[在提出辞职到正式离职期间要保持工作效率，否则会给前任公司留下负面印象。]

# II.How to tell your boss you're quitting your job
> It's just as important to be professional when you’re quitting your job as it is when you’re trying to get hired.﻿

> It can be challenging to take a calm and reasoned approach to resigning [冷静周全的方式] if you've been mistreated or underappreciated[受到了苛待，或者自己的价值没被赏识]. However, what you say when you leave could be mentioned to prospective employers[潜在雇主], and negativity [负面的态度] isn't going to get you a positive recommendation. Whenever possible, leave your job gracefully.

# 1.A thank you for the opportunity.
> Express your gratitude for the opportunity to grow in your current job or learn new skills.

# 2.An explanation for why you are leaving.
> You do not need to mention the specifics of your new job but might choose to allude /ə'lʊd/ [vi.提及,暗指] to this in a general way.[隐晦地提一下大概。]

# 3.An offer to help with the transition.
> If appropriate, you might state that you are willing to help train a replacement [培训继任者] or be available to answer questions after you have moved on.

# 4.Notice.
> Two weeks' notice is the traditional amount of notice. If you’re working under a contract or labor agreement, you might be required to give a different amount of notice.[按照其要求的特定时间来告知]

# 5.The date you are leaving.
> State a specific date for your expected last day of employment. That date will be used as your official termination date.[你最终离职的官方日期。]

# III.grammar
# 1.“to be more than + adj. & to be less than + adj.
> 1)The phrase “to be more than + adj” is an indirect and polite way to say “very.” It’s commonly combined with adjectives like “willing” or “happy” and emphasizes your enthusiasm to do something. [通常与“willing”或“happy”等形容词连用，强调你做某事的强烈意愿.]

> 2)In contrast, the opposite expression “to be less than + adj” means “not very” and is often used to politely express displeasure. For example, “His boss was less than pleased with his performance at work.

- 1. I'd be more than happy to answer your questions. [我很乐意回答你的问题。]

- 2. She'd be more than willing to help you out. [她很乐意帮你一把。]

- 3. The client was less than impressed with his rude behaviour. [客户对他的粗鲁行为不太满意。]

# 2.过去式表达礼貌：I just wanted to let you know
> Past tense equals polite, that's a little formula that will really really help you with English. I wanted to let you know, I was wondering if you had time. 

# 3.phenomenal [adj.] & phenomenon /fə'nɑmɪnən/ [n.现象]
> 1）phenomenal: it's just a word we use to emphasize how much of something is.if something is phenomenal, it just means it's awesome.so when someone's phenomenal, they're basically amazing.your boss could say to you, you've been a phenomenal team player.Of course it could also be a phenomenal mistake. 

> 2) A phenomenon is just something that exists,

# 4.resign [v.]  & quit   & a letter of resignation [n.辞呈] &  two weeks' notice 
> 1)resign would be a verb, and so yeah, it's just a more formal way of saying that you quit your job,

> 2) quitting your job, you can do that in many different ways, formal, informal. You could just maybe not show up anymore.

> 3)so resignation, this is a noun but this is basically the noun form of resign, quit, leave.normally when we leave, we hand in a letter of resignation.it's just saying like,"Hey I'm quitting."

> 4) This two week notice basically means you're giving a resignation saying that you'll be leaving in two weeks,tells them,"Hey I'm going to leave in two weeks.some companies are different, some companies want a month or this or that, but here the two weeks thing this was a pretty normal very standard in the United States.By law it's one week but companies are free to set their own notice periods in their contracts as long as they are reasonably they can't ask for a year notice here.

# 5.branching out (into/from) sth [phr.扩展业务，涉足新工作] & pursuing & take the leap [phr.作出改变]
> 1) so branching out makes me think about a tree.Yeah because a tree has many branches. Okay so when you branch out into something, you try something new.so you could branch out into a new hobby or in this case a new job. Now importantly Lisa already said branch out into something, but you can also branch out from something.Yeah, for example, you could branch out from web design and branch out into software development.

> 2) to pursue something just means to chase after something.we often say pursue your dreams, goals, ambitions or interests.

> 3) so when you take the leap, you are basically taking your chances, you're doing something different and there's an element of risk.So a leap is a kind of jump and I guess you're jumping into the unknown. Now most importantly here you can say take the leap, you can also say take a leap, you will hear both of them.

# 6.sorely /'sɔrli/ [adv.疼痛的，非常的]
> 1) Now, sorely, the key root of sorely is the word sore, which means Oh! this hurts.Yeah it's a pain.

> 2) But in other contexts, it usually just means extremely or very.like sorely mistaken.You could also be sorely disappointed by something.So a great word that you can use basically to emphasize anything.

# 7.persuade & convice 
> 1)persuade on the other hand, that has more to do with reasoning and arguments, like maybe you want to persuade your uncle to change his opinion about something.

> 2)to convince someone is to make someone believe something.so you wouldn't really persuade yourself, that is sort of the key point there.you can convince yourself.

# 8.stay on [phr.继续留下]
> Stay on means he will remain here, he will continue to work, he will continue to participate.Yeah, it's basically a shorter form of stay on the job.

# 9.seamless [adj.连续的，顺利的]
> 1）Seamless:if something is seamless,it just means smooth.so someone's performance at work could be seamless.Or I actually hear this a lot in like, customer experience.

> 2) seam : so I used to work at a fashion college and I heard the word,"seam", a lot, because seam basically comes from clothing.Yeah, it's where you sew two pieces of clothing together.so if you put two pieces of clothing together, it might be very clear and obvious that you've done it, if you can see the seam which is where you actually connected these two pieces of material together, it's kind of ugly.

# 10.To have a life & get a life
> 1) "To have a life" means to have interests, hobbies or other enjoyable activities outside of work or school. These activities are generally interesting and make your life worthwhile.

> 2) In contrast, if someone says you need to "get a life," then it means that you need to find more exciting or interesting activities to do. It also expresses that you are wasting too much time on useless or trivial things. Be careful when using this phrase because it can be rude when said to others.

- 1. Between raising the kids and work, I don’t really have a life. [我终日奔波于养育孩子和工作之间，并没有什么个人生活。]

- 2. Why don’t you get a life and stop telling others what to do? [你为什么不过你自己的日子，别再告诉别人该做什么了？]

- 3. I don’t think she has a life. She’s just on her phone all the time. [我认为她没有个人生活，她总是在打电话.]

# 11.bit the bullet [phr.咬紧牙关] & jumping the gun 
> 1)So bit the bullet this means like to do something that you've thought about doing for a while but you like may be afraid to do it.Yeah, maybe it's difficult, you don't really want to do it.But finally you do it and yeah bite the bullet.Or maybe you want to do it, but you're kind of I don't know should I do it, kind of scared to do it.

> 2)So jumping the gun would mean like just don't do it too fast.make sure that you've thought about it, and that you're sure it's really what you want to do.

# 12.overworked [adj.过分劳累的] & underpaid [adj.所得报酬过低的] work-life balance [n.工作与生活的平衡]
> 1）So overworked and underpaid, so basically, he worked a whole lot and made very little money.So overworked. So he has this word "over" here, it does basically means too much, so too much work and under is not enough.

> 2)So if you feel like you don't have a life, like all you do is work, there's no work-life balance, just all work and no life.We say all work and no play makes you a dull /dʌl/ boy.

# 13.make a scene [phr.大吵大闹] & cause a scene & uproar /'ʌprɔr/ [n.骚动]
> 1)Making a scene is, well, if you're in a public place, the workplace or anywhere really and you're being like maybe very loud or inappropriate. Sort of makes other people look, and stare and be like what's going on there.

> 2)We might also say to cause a scene, and I also say it may be an uproar, uproar.

# 14.take the news [phr.接受这个消息] & have hard feelings against/towards sb [n.生气、反感] & upset about sth with sb
> 1) Hard feelings is bad feelings between people, or something that in the future you still feel really angry about this, perhaps, oh yeah, that's still a lot of hard feelings between me and my old boss, five years down the line, I still hate him. So hard feeling is your upset about something, and you're upset about something with somebody.

> 2)You can't have hard feelings by yourself, it has to be the cause of somebody.You can't really have hard feelings against like a car or a building,or,you know.
