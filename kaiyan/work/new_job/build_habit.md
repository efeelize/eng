# Build a good habit

# I.The key to developing good habits
> Bad habits are hard to break, but here are a few ways that will have you cutting out [phr.切断,删除,停止] negative or lazy habitual behavior and starting to form good habits.

# 1.Start with one
> There will probably be 5, 10, 20 habits you would like to introduce to your life, but start with small one, so you can stick to it and lay a foundation [奠定基础] for more to come in due course.

# 2.Give yourself no option
> Pick a habit and do it the exact same way every day for a month. Leaving options open only makes it easier for the habit to slip. Aim for same time, same method, same goal, same outcome.[追求同时同式，同一目标和结果]

# 3.Tell someone about it
> Tell someone close to you what habit you are working on. Pick someone you trust that will be able to keep you in check and that will motivate you to keep you on track!

# II.the self-imposed deadline
> Deadlines don’t always have to come from your boss. In fact, the self-imposed deadline will help you accomplish more.Whether you’re starting a business or writing a dissertation /'dɪsɚ'teʃən/ [n.专题论文,学位论文], it’s important to establish interim /'ɪntərɪm/ [adj.临时的] goals. Here are some self-scheduling techniques that are hallmarks /ˈhɔlˌmɑrk/ [n.品质证明;特点] of achieving more.

# 1.Start your day as early as possible, even if you’re not a morning person. 
> This instills /ɪnˈstɪl/ [vt.徐徐滴入] more incentive /ɪn'sɛntɪv/ [n.激励] and motivation for getting more done, so that your final task doesn’t seem so far out of reach.

# 2.Tackle [处理] similar small tasks back-to-back. 
> That’s what gets you on a roll[帮你进入连续状态]. The mind thrives on repetition[大脑很喜欢重复性的工作], at least to a point. Capitalize [v充分利用某事物] on that feeling you get when you listen to your favorite song, or what makes you crave your favorite hobby.[向往做最爱的嗜好时的那种感觉]

# 3. Avoid the curse of the “final push.[临时抱佛脚]” 
> Divide up a project so that the longest part is the first part, the next longest is the second, and so on. Otherwise, you’ll feel worn out before you reach the finish. If you’re “dead at the deadline,”those other projects you’re juggling will stagnate /stæɡ'net/ [vi.停滞,不流动].

# III.Make Your Own Deadlines to Make Your Own Success
> There are a lot of strategies for people to use to achieve more. Deadlines are a fact of life that we can't get around[绕不开的事实]. Imposing deadlines on yourself can help make the final deadline seem less intimidating. In doing this, it can also reduce stress and help you enjoy your work. Humans naturally don't prepare for the future very well, so in a modern world full of responsibilities and expectations, we need extra help. Here are a few more tips that might help you follow through with your self-imposed deadlines:

> Make your self-imposed deadlines external[公布自己设定的最后期限]. Ask your friend, colleague, mom, or even your boss to be your accountability partner. Let them know about your deadline so they can encourage and remind you. 

> Set incremental /ɪnkrə'məntl/ [adj.增加的] deadlines for smaller milestones. Instead of saying, "I want to write a dissertation by next year," make a smaller win for yourself: "I want to write the introduction of my dissertation by next month." 

> Remind yourself of the "why". It's good to ask yourself what life would be like with and without the project your working on. This will give you purpose and motivation.

# IV.grammar
