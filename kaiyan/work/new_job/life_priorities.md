# life_priorities

# I.What should be your most important priorities in life
# 1. Health 
> It’s the first rule - care about yourself. Your health, peace of mind, wellness – all of this matters.Do what you know is right for you. It can be through exercise, meditation /ˌmɛdɪ'teʃən/ [n.冥想], yoga, or spiritual practices[灵修].

# 2. Relationships 
> Your relationships are your source of happiness and purpose. You have lesser pains and regrets when you stay with the people you love.Whether it's your community, friends, or family that makes you happy - stand by them.[留在他们身边]

# 3. Security
> It’s just one of those fundamentals about life which are embedded /ɪm'bɛd/ [烙印] in us.Sometimes, you save money for education, hospital expenses, or welfare. But ultimately all your efforts are about securing your family and yourself.

# 4.Development 
> Although life changes constantly[生活瞬息万变], you need to prepare for improvement.As you go through life, development becomes an inseparable /ɪn'sɛprəbl/ [adj.不可分的] part of your existence.You can invest in your learning, fix your current lifestyle, or adapt new skills.

# 5. Play
> Have fun. Life’s not about bare existence. It’s not pure work, either. It’s about being a human and living like one.Be a child, be a dreamer, start working on your passions. Gather enough reasons to smile.

# II.grammar
# 1.what you may be...you could be...
> 1)So this actually could be used for all kinds of things, especially when you're contemplating making decisions.because you really do have kind of a negative thing in the one part of it and then a more positive thing in the other, so what you may be doing here, it might seem very bad, well, you could be doing something else or you could be receiving something else.so we basically use this when we're what we call weighing options, yeah. So basically, like I said when we're considering making a decision.we always use this pattern just to weigh two options and most importantly, from a grammatical point of view, it's always going to be what you may be doing here, you could be doing there. 

> 2) but sometimes also, you don't have to put the loss first. So, another example could be what you may be gaining in their eyes, you could be losing in the eyes of others.

> 2)This is an expression to give a different perspective that the listener may not have thought of[提供他/她可能没有想到的不同观点]. Usually the second clause is the opposite of the first[第二个从句与第一个从句相反]. It could be used to give advice, or to reassure someone that they've made the right choice[宽慰某人说他们做出了正确的选择]. Here are some examples:

- 1. What you may be missing out on during the weekends, you could be stacking in cash. [或许你在周末错过了什么，但你收获了财富的积累]

- 2. What you may be losing in a friend, you could be gaining in a son. [或许你在朋友身上失去的东西会在你儿子身上获得] 

- 3. What you may be gaining in their eyes, you could be losing in the eyes of others.[或许在他们眼中你得到的东西正是其他人眼中你可能在失去的东西]

# 2.contemplate /'kɑntəmplet/ [vt. & vi. 深思, 细想] & thinking about & in light of [phr.考虑到] & considering 
> 1)So this is a great word that people use when they're sick of using the word "thinking".This is pretty much a more advanced word that expresses thinking about or considering.

> 2)We often use "contemplating" for like really big or really serious, weighty subjects.usually has to do with bigger decisions that you have to make and not even the silly decision sometimes, it's also just like really, maybe deeply thinking about something sometimes.like the universe, you can contemplate the universe.Or you can contemplate the meaning of life,

> 3)if you go to a restaurant, you might say, "I'm thinking about having the steak." But you probably wouldn't say, "I'm contemplating ordering the steak."

> 4）And "in light of" can mean "considering". But I'm not sure that we need such a comprehensive package considering last year's usage.

# 3.grueling /ˈɡruəlɪŋ/ [adj.艰辛的] & gauge /gedʒ/  [n.测量]
> 1）grueling basically just means like exhausting.So basically, grueling also, something that's grueling, it could be physically exhausting, mentally exhausting or both. Yeah, army training, a really tough workout, maybe raising kids or having a bad relationship, you could say, "Oh, this is just so grueling."

> 2)gauge basically means measure.

# 4.you know what I always say 
> It's almost like we should be talking about that phrase in and of itself, like that's just such a bad thing to say, "You know what I always say."All of those things on your car on the dashboard /'dæʃ'bɔrd/ [汽车上的仪表盘], call those gauges.like the speedometer /'spi'dɑmɪtɚ/ [n.<机>示速器,速度计], and all of those ones, gauge. Yeah, and just like that we can use it to, you know, talk about personality, like you can gauge a person's attitude.

# 5.work hard when you're young,so you don't have to when you're old
> But just remember that this phrase, although it's not really short, it is commonly used. So basically, just don't waste your time, all your time when you're young and, so you don't have to work hard when you're older.

# 6.in the long run [phr.从长远看]
> In the long run, so this basically just means like down the road in the future.So actually I said before like at the end of the day, kind of similar idea, but this went usually more about projecting into the future like into some distant part of the future.It's stiffly /ˈstɪflɪ/ [adv.僵硬地] more future-oriented or like way down the line.

# 7.odds are [phr.有可能]
> this basically means like most likely.he says "odds are working around the clock will take its toll on my health".And he thinks that most likely if he's working all the time around the clock, it's going to take a toll, so it's going to basically impact his health.

# 8.take a toll /tol/ on [phr.造成损失]
> We're talking about health, of course, that's bad, but you know certain decisions can also take a toll on your wallet or your bank account.or take a toll on your marriage or take a toll on your friendships or take a toll on the... all kinds of things in your life really.Take a toll is never used to talk about something good.It's always a negative impact.

# 9.put a price tag on [phr.估价] & invaluable [adj.无价的]
> 1)So, when you can't put a price tag on something, it just means that it has no monetary value, it's more important than money.Put a price tag on your health, or you can't. Or put it on your well being. We also say health is well being.

> 2)Actually, we often use the word "invaluable" to talk about these things, they're so valuable that they can't be valued.

# 10.short-term pain for long-term gain [phr.短期痛苦获取长期快乐]
> So here this phrase he's using again just basically saying, you don't want to work hard when you're old.we're talking about the long run before or the short run. Short term is basically the exact same thing, it's just, you know, the immediate future and long term is just way down the road.because the amount of pain that you're going to have to do now, which is in the short term, right, which is going to be limited, is going to give you all of these benefits in the future.

# 11.hinder /'hɪndɚ/ [v.阻碍]
> it just means to kind of like obstruct or to not allow something to happen.it means were negatively affecting it.So something is hindering, it's going to take a toll on something. So it's... give some examples, how about this one? I was hindered by blinding rage[怒火].Blinding your rage will often, it's hard to make good decisions when you're in any kind of emotional state, whether it's blinding rage or maybe even like if you're really drunk, you know, excessive drinking will hinder your judgment.

# 12.burnout /'bɝnaʊt/ [n & v.倦怠]
> 1)great word because it can be a noun, it can be a verb and it just basically, you know, think about a candle, it's lit, and then when the fire is no longer top the candle, it has burned out.It can also be used as an adjective, too. If you say, "I'm burnt out."

> 2) you can be burnt out, you can burn out at work and you can just say there is such a thing as burned out, it is a concept that managers should be aware of. and this is what happens when your job is really grueling /ˈɡruəlɪŋ/.

# 13.economic standpoint [n.经济角度]
> standpoint just basically means like from a type of perspective.So this can be used for all kinds of things, so here he says "from an economic standpoint". So, you know, when thinking economically, this doesn't make sense, but when it comes to this phrase, "standpoint", you could put all kinds of other things in front of it, right? Like from a historic standpoint. 

# 14.work smart [phr.聪明的工作] & work smarter,not harder & live better,not longer
> 1)so we have a phrase,it's like don't work hard,work smart.Yeah, exactly, because you know, lots of people work in grueling /ˈɡruəlɪŋ/ jobs, you know, that means they work very very hard or they have to work very very hard, but a lot of people, they can figure out other ways to work, they don't need to work in such grueling conditions, they can work smarter than other people. basically finding ways to be like more productive and it just like kind of get things done without really a lot of waste.

> 2)that just means be more efficient with your time.

> 3)this is kind of a fun little pattern too.You could say, "live better, not longer."

# III.pattern
***Hey dad, I'm contemplating working at this tech firm, but I heard the hours are grueling.***

***Well Cory, you know what I always say: "work hard when you're young so you don't have to when you're old."***

***Yeah, I get that. But I don't want to give up my personal life to work work work. I'll miss out on the things I can only do while I'm young.***

***But what you may be sacrificing in work-life balance, you could be gaining in career success. In my opinion, that's what will prove most important in the long run.***

***I hear you, but I'm sure my work-life balance isn't all I'd be sacrificing. Odds are, working around the clock will take a toll on my health as well, and you can't put a price tag on your well-being.***

***I'd argue otherwise[我不这么看]: I still think short-term pain for long-term gain is worth it.***

***Worth it for who? Studies point out that long work hours actually hinder productivity -- employees eventually burnout. So, from an economic standpoint, it doesn't make sense.***

***Ok, I guess the point I'm just trying to make is, if you don't put in the extra work while time is on your side, it will only become more difficult to get ahead.***

***Ok, well my point is I'd rather be able to work smart and still have a life.***
