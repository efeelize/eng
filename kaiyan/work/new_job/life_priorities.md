# life_priorities

# I.What should be your most important priorities in life
# 1. Health 
> It’s the first rule - care about yourself. Your health, peace of mind, wellness – all of this matters.Do what you know is right for you. It can be through exercise, meditation /ˌmɛdɪ'teʃən/ [n.冥想], yoga, or spiritual practices[灵修].

# 2. Relationships 
> Your relationships are your source of happiness and purpose. You have lesser pains and regrets when you stay with the people you love.Whether it's your community, friends, or family that makes you happy - stand by them.[留在他们身边]

# 3. Security
> It’s just one of those fundamentals about life which are embedded /ɪm'bɛd/ [烙印] in us.Sometimes, you save money for education, hospital expenses, or welfare. But ultimately all your efforts are about securing your family and yourself.

# 4.Development 
> Although life changes constantly[生活瞬息万变], you need to prepare for improvement.As you go through life, development becomes an inseparable /ɪn'sɛprəbl/ [adj.不可分的] part of your existence.You can invest in your learning, fix your current lifestyle, or adapt new skills.

# 5. Play
> Have fun. Life’s not about bare existence. It’s not pure work, either. It’s about being a human and living like one.Be a child, be a dreamer, start working on your passions. Gather enough reasons to smile.

# II.grammar
# 1.what you may be...you could be...
> This is an expression to give a different perspective that the listener may not have thought of[提供他/她可能没有想到的不同观点]. Usually the second clause is the opposite of the first[第二个从句与第一个从句相反]. It could be used to give advice, or to reassure someone that they've made the right choice[宽慰某人说他们做出了正确的选择]. Here are some examples:

- 1. What you may be missing out on during the weekends, you could be stacking in cash. [或许你在周末错过了什么，但你收获了财富的积累]

- 2. What you may be losing in a friend, you could be gaining in a son. [或许你在朋友身上失去的东西会在你儿子身上获得] 

- 3. What you may be gaining in their eyes, you could be losing in the eyes of others.[或许在他们眼中你得到的东西正是其他人眼中你可能在失去的东西]

***Hey dad, I'm contemplating working at this tech firm, but I heard the hours are grueling.***

***Well Cory, you know what I always say: "work hard when you're young so you don't have to when you're old."***

***Yeah, I get that. But I don't want to give up my personal life to work work work. I'll miss out on the things I can only do while I'm young.***

***But what you may be sacrificing in work-life balance, you could be gaining in career success. In my opinion, that's what will prove most important in the long run.***

***I hear you, but I'm sure my work-life balance isn't all I'd be sacrificing. Odds are, working around the clock will take a toll on my health as well, and you can't put a price tag on your well-being.***

***I'd argue otherwise: I still think short-term pain for long-term gain is worth it.***

***Worth it for who? Studies point out that long work hours actually hinder productivity -- employees eventually burnout. So, from an economic standpoint, it doesn't make sense.***

***Ok, I guess the point I'm just trying to make is, if you don't put in the extra work while time is on your side, it will only become more difficult to get ahead.***

***Ok, well my point is I'd rather be able to work smart and still have a life.***
