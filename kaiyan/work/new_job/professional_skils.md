# Professional_skils

# I.Tricky interview questions and how to answer them
# 1. Are you the type who checks email during your vacation?
> On one hand, you want to frame [表现出] yourself as a dedicated [尽职] person. At the same time, employers want to make sure you're smart about taking care of yourself even outside of the office.

> Suggestions: Confirm your dedication to getting your job done[要肯定自己会尽职尽责完成工作], but also convey [表达出] your understanding that personal well-being [个人健康] is key to professional success. 

# 2.What's your biggest weakness?
> When employers ask this question, it's not just about figuring out your weaknesses, but about finding out whether or not you're aware of them, and if you're intending to make changes.

> Suggestions: It's okay to mention some weaknesses you need to work on[需要改进]. But, use your answer as an opportunity to highlight other strengths and underscore your determination to keep getting better.[强调你其他的优点和你想要进步的决心]

# 3. Why do you want to work here?
> Employers want to figure out if you've done your research about the company, and whether you want this job, rather than any old job.[比起你之前的工作，你是不是真的想做这份工作。]

> Suggestions: Talk about how you connect with the company's core values[核心价值观], their mission[工作职责], and the work[工作内容] they do. Then, you can go into a little more detail about the specific position for which you're applying.[你可以更详细地聊一聊你申请的具体职位。]

# II.grammar
# 1.noun + sense & sense of + noun 
> 1)In this lesson, we saw the phrase "market sense". When we say "noun + sense (e.g., fashion sense)", "sense" means "judgement"[判断能力]. So "market sense" means he has good judgement about the market.[对市场有良好的判断力]

> 2) So I mean it's funny how we would say like market sense, fashion sense. But sense of humour, like, we don't say a humor sense.When we say "sense of + noun (e.g., sense of humor)", the word "sense" is slightly different. In this case, it means "feeling, understanding or ability".[它意味着感觉、理解或能力] So, "sense of humor" means that someone understands humor and has the ability to be funny.[某人很懂幽默，并且有趣味]

- 1. When I lived in Italy, I learned a lot about good fashion sense.[领悟到时尚感是怎么一回事。]

- 2. You’re always too serious. You should lighten up and have a sense of humor.

- 3. When you get a new job, making new friends quickly will help you develop a sense of belonging.[培养归属感]

# 2.expertise /'ɛkspɝ'tiz/ [n.专业技能、知识] & verticals [垂直领域] & horizontally /ˌhɑrɪˈzɑntəlɪ/ [adv.水平地] & analytical skills  [adj.善于分析的] & analysis /ə'næləsɪs/ [n.分析] & logical &  assets /'æsɛt/ [n.资产、品质]
> 1)Expertise, and it just means a lot of knowledge.Means like you are an expert.Expert in this particular field or area.Expert in this particular field or area.

> 2)vertical of course means up and down, as opposed to horizontal, which means side to side. So when I saw the word for the first time, I thought: Ok, it has to mean something about up and down.So in that same sense, it basically means you are targeting a specific market, you're not going horizontally /ˌhɑrɪˈzɑntəlɪ/ to many different industries.

> 3)if you think about those lines like a horizontal line, as a company you want to sell to as many people or in as many markets as possible. Whereas in a vertical situation, you just want to focus on one specific thing.

> 4) Josh has a pretty good answer here. I'm not the best at answering this question, but I think that his answer is pretty decent here. He believes his analytical skills and market sense are great assets /'æsɛt/ as a product manager.Also some languages tend to be more analytical than others. For example, English is not really all that analytical in the sense of you're not really able to just look at a word and very easily determine its meaning.

> 5)So analysis, you know, the noun form. When you're, like, kind of looking for patterns studying or something?

> 6)a lot of people tend to be very analytical, and in this sense it's very similar to, like, logical?

> 7)Now assets, of course are things that are very valuable.It could be anything. It could be a quality of your personality, but it also could be, like, a house.Yeah, it could be your property.Yeah, it's anything that you own, right? Anything that you own that is valuable. I mean every year when you pay taxes, you have to make a list of your assets. Yeah, the government will always want to come, and take their, their own chunk. 

# 3.your values should be well aligned with company & match up with & fit 
> it's a fit, these people, these values, these passions, they all fit with the company, they're all aligned with the company.Basically they all match up with the company.

# 4.framing [v.立框架]
> 1)It'a a structure. Well, I mean, if you look at a photograph, and a lot of times the photograph or the piece of art will be framed. They have that wood around it.Giving it a structure.Yeah, if you put a frame on a painting, sometimes the frame is more expensive than the actually painting.Sure, I mean it could be made from, like, really expensive wood, or could have really you know, beautiful carvings /'kɑrvɪŋ/ [n.雕刻品] in it. 

> 2)But in the sense it basically, when you frame something, you just kind of telling it in a way you say it,essentially.In this case, he's framing problems in a way that leads the whole team to deliver.

- It's important to frame an argument so that it's relevant and easy to understand.[你的论证要有框架，这样更好切中主题而且易于理解]

- I was surprised how strong he was considering his wiry /'waɪəri/  frame.[骨架很瘦]

# 5.deliver on a promise [phr.履行诺言]
> we also do use deliver with the word promises. But here we don't tend to say you deliver promises, you deliver on a promise.

# 6. empathetic /ɛmpə'θɛtɪk/ [adj.有同理心的] & straightforward [adj.直接了当的] & beat aorund the bush [phr.旁敲侧击] & to the point 
> 1）so empathetic means that you really understand someone's feelings, kind of deeply, right？You put yourself in their position, or in their shoes[phr.站在他们的立场]. 

> 2) Now I did mention to the point here, which I like because it basically means the same as straightforward, as someone who doesn't beat around the bush.

# 7.run into conflict 
> 1)So speaking about humans, humans are emotional. They run into conflict all the time.Right, it's not just about how well you work, but how well you work with other people, this interpersonal thing.

> 2)And of course conflict could be… well, it could exist on a very small scale, it could be, you know, at work.You know, they hate each other. Or it could be states, governments, countries.Yeah, for sure, like diplomatic [外交] conflict，armed conflict.

> 3)conflict:as a noun as we're using it today, of course the pronunciation is /'kɑnflɪkt/ ;
if it is a verb, which I could also be Jim conflicted /kɑn'flɪkt/  with John.we are putting this stress on the second syllable./'sɪləbl/ [n.音节]

# 8.pivot /'pɪvət/ [n.转型] & pivotal [adj.]
> 1)in basketball, you're allowed to turn holding the ball, but you can only turn on one foot.Yeah, you're changing suddenly into a different direction, but with that foot still on the ground.a president might pivot in a new direction.

> 2) pivotal. And it has this kind of meaning of there's something has a central role, it's very critical to it.Well, you often hear this word pivotal with things, like, pivotal moments, or pivotal change. So it's usually talking about that very important point in history, or in the story when something changes completely, right?

- The future of this company pivots on the success of tomorrow's business deal.[公司的未来要看明天的单子能否成功签下了]

- The camera was mounted /'maʊntɪd/ [v.安装] on a tripod /'traɪpɑd/ [n.三脚架] pivot so that we can turin it without shaking it too much.[相机固定在三脚架枢轴上，这样我们可以转动它，但不会摇晃]

- Programmer XX was pivotal to the success of Apple.[XXX是苹果公司成功的关键]

# 9.scenarios /sɪ'nɛrɪ,o/ [n.情景、脚本]
> So Josh is talking about a major product pivot, and when this happened there was a lot of disagreement. So what he did to resolve that was he led the charge to assess different scenarios. Okay, so you know, a big company is probably not going to do a big pivot like that, with everybody agreeing, right? There's going to have to be a lot of conflict there, and one of the ways to sort of handle that conflict, is to just... Well, let's run some tests.

# 10.assess /ə'sɛs/ [v.评估] & assessment [n.] & evaluate
> 1) assess, again you generally tend to assess things for their value or their worth. So again, we see assets earlier, so like you could assess the value of your assets /'æsɛt/.

> 2) Whereas evaluate, you usually have, you know, a set of criteria. So for Connor's example before, I've also been evaluated in those situations. Do the students like him? Does he dress well? Does he, you know, like, try to maximize the student's talking time?

# 11.leading the charge 
> It sounds like he's kind of a war general, like, leading the team into battle.

- China, the world's biggest video-game market, is leading the charge.[中国是世界最大的电子游戏市场，在监管方面首当其冲]

- Why is Frank Underwood leading the charge on that, not me? [牵头]

- The health care industry is ripe /raɪp/ [adj.时机成熟的] for blockchain-inspired transformation, and SimplyVital Health is leading the charge.[医疗保健行业已经成熟,可以进行区块链式的转型，而 SimplyVital Health 正在引领这一潮流.]

# 12.disciplined [adj.自律的、受过训练的、遵守纪律的]
> I mean the whole point about being disciplined is having focus, staying on track, you know, not letting things, sort of, distract you.you got to wake up at 6 a.m., go to the gym, workout. Nobody wants to do. Well, some people do.Some people they really want to do that. And those people probably don't need discipline.

# 13.on board.[phr.认可，同意] & frowned /fraun/ upon [phr.不同意]
> 1)So it just means everyone agrees.The whole point is that it could mean on board at the organization, or on board with an idea, with a team, with a plan.Yeah, if you're on board, you're all going in the same direction.Right, and if you are not on board with an idea or a team, you are obviously going in a different direction.

> 2)To start a new job or position, we do use on board a lot with organizations, companies, HR. Just because after Josh gets hired, if he gets hired, Katherine would probably say, like, welcome on board.

> 3)so frowned upon, a "frown" is like the opposite of a smile.A "frown" is an angry face, so "frown upon" means you disapprove of something.Yeah, like often companies frown upon, you know, dating employees—when employees date each other, coworkers.

# 14.quote unquote [phr.所谓的]
> we use it when we want to distance ourselves from an idea,but still say it.

# III.pattern
***Josh, why do you think you’d be a good fit for this position?***

***Well, I think I have highly relevant work experience and expertise in similar verticals. On top of that, I believe my passion and values are well aligned with what you’re doing here as a company.***

***We’re certainly looking for people who share our values. Now what would you say your strengths are?***

***I believe my analytical skills and market sense are great assets as a product manager. I’m good at framing problems and leading the whole team to deliver.***

***What about your weaknesses? What are some areas you still need to work on?***

***One area that I’m working on is being more empathetic. I’m naturally pretty straightforward and to the point, but I’ve learned that in order to bring out the best in people, you need to be more sensitive and see things from their point of view.***

***I think that’s something everybody can improve on. Can you also give me an example of where your team ran into conflict? How did you handle it?***

***For sure. When my last company decided to make a major product pivot, there was a lot of internal disagreement. I led the charge to assess different scenarios, used data as evidence and ran a limited trial before we made the change.***

***That does sound like a smart way to go about it.***

***Thank you! This disciplined approach helped us to come to a solution that everyone was on board with.***
