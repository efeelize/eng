# I.Tricky interview questions and how to answer them
# 1. Are you the type who checks email during your vacation?
> On one hand, you want to frame [表现出] yourself as a dedicated [尽职] person. At the same time, employers want to make sure you're smart about taking care of yourself even outside of the office.

# 2.What's your biggest weakness?
> When employers ask this question, it's not just about figuring out your weaknesses, but about finding out whether or not you're aware of them, and if you're intending to make changes.

> Suggestions: It's okay to mention some weaknesses you need to work on[需要改进]. But, use your answer as an opportunity to highlight other strengths and underscore your determination to keep getting better.[强调你其他的优点和你想要进步的决心]

# II.grammar
# 1.noun + sense & sense of + noun 
> 1)In this lesson, we saw the phrase "market sense". When we say "noun + sense (e.g., fashion sense)", "sense" means "judgement"[判断能力]. So "market sense" means he has good judgement about the market.[对市场有良好的判断力]

> 2)When we say "sense of + noun (e.g., sense of humor)", the word "sense" is slightly different. In this case, it means "feeling, understanding or ability".[它意味着感觉、理解或能力] So, "sense of humor" means that someone understands humor and has the ability to be funny.[某人很懂幽默，并且有趣味]

- 1. When I lived in Italy, I learned a lot about good fashion sense.[领悟到时尚感是怎么一回事。]

- 2. You’re always too serious. You should lighten up and have a sense of humor.

- 3. When you get a new job, making new friends quickly will help you develop a sense of belonging.[培养归属感]
