# I.5 tips for being awesome at conference calls
# 1.smile
> The way you deliver information is the key to capturing your audience's attention. How you talk on the phone is no different than how you present yourself on stage when presenting to an audience. In reality, your conference call is very similar to being on stage where the lights are so bright you can't see anyone's faces. Smile while you speak and your positive energy will come through - the people on the other end of the phone will be able to sense and feel your smile. Try it.

# 2.energy
> The energy you put into [投入] the call is directly related to the energy you'll get back [收获]. What is a great result in a conference call? Everyone enjoying the call. By bringing energy to the call you'll lift everyone up, maybe even create laughter and ultimately better rapport /ræ'pɔː/ [最终建立良好的关系]. Get excited about the items you care about [对你关心的事物保持兴奋]. Tell stories that bring out your passion [讲述能激发你热情的故事]. At the very least, speak clearly and with sufficient volume so everyone can understand and hear your words.

# 3.be yourself
> Conference calls are like emails - it's too easy to lack emotion, interpret things wrong, and to dismiss [忽视] the opportunity to build relationships. Since you saved so much time by not travelling, why not use some of the conference call time to build rapport and get to know people? [为什么不利用通话的时间来建立融洽的关系并结识更多人呢？] It can be as simple as asking everyone for an introduction and as meaningful as talking about family and life at the beginning and end of the calls [要求每个人进行介绍，在电话的开头和结尾谈论一下家庭和生活]. Do what you'd normally do if you were in person for the first few minutes - say hello, check in with each other, and ask questions not related to the call topic. Be a person, not a robot at the end of the phone.

# 4.focus
> Focus your time and energy on the topic, the people, and the overall meeting [整体会议]. Eliminate /ɪ'lɪmɪneɪt/ [v.消除] distractions by hiding your phone, turning off email, and taking notes the old-fashioned way: pen and paper. If you're easily distracted when you're not talking, taking notes will help you stay engaged. It's also a great way to capture questions you want to ask when appropriate.

# 5.technology
> Know your tech. There's nothing worse than a presenter who has never used the conference call technology and wastes the first ten to fifteen minutes getting setup [这样会议前10到15分钟都可能被白白浪费]. Dial in early. [尽早拨打电话] Setup and test the service well before you meet [在开始前安装并测试好]. Download the software ahead of time [提前下载软件]. Most conference calls are very short, and nobody wants to sit around wasting that valuable time on bad technology or users who aren't prepared.[...来解决技术问题，或是等待没有准备好的参会者]
