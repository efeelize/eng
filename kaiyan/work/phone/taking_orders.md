# Taking_orders
# I.How to take orders by phone
> Be polite and gather all the necessary information to place the order. Complete the transaction /træn'zækʃən/ [n.交易] in a professional manner and promote customer satisfaction.

> Identify [vt.认出,识别] yourself and your place of business when you answer the phone. Never eat or drink when on the phone and speak clearly and slowly so the customer can understand you. Keep your voice on an even level[声音平稳].

> Listen carefully to the customer and write down any pertinent /'pɝtnənt/ [adj.有关的]information. Ensure you get all the necessary information to place the order, including the exact item[货品], specifications[规格], size[尺寸], and any other pertinent information. 

> Always repeat the customers' order back to them for verification /ˌvɛrɪfɪ'keʃən/ [核实,查对]. Make sure they are clear on the price for the item ordered to avoid the customer receiving an unpleasant surprise when they receive the bill.

> Ask the customers for their phone numbers so you can call them back if you have any questions about the order later. Wait for them to hang up the phone first so they do not hear the noise of the phone hanging up.

# II.grammar
# 1.wholesaler [n.批发商][adv.]
> 1)Right. And when we're talking about wholesalers, we're talking about businesses that sell in bulk. They sell large amounts of stuff.Right. So you can't just buy, for example, one toothbrush. You have to buy like a thousand toothbrushes.So if you're a business, and you go through a lot of paper for example, you're gonna want to buy a lot. You're gonna buy a large amount, and this is what Charles is doing today.Right. And so actually examples of a wholesaler would be Costco. They're not like the same kind of wholesaler, but they say they are wholesalers.And usually, when we buy from a wholesaler, the price is cheaper because we're buying so much at one time.

> 2)And we can also use this word as an adverb /'ædvɝb/ , "you can buy something wholesale."

# 2.place an order [phr.下单]
> Right, so "place an order" is just a phrase that means order something.Right, so "place" is like "make," "make an order." That's another way we can say it too.Yeah, it's like you're putting an order in.So we order something and then we have to wait for it to come. So that's kind of the difference between buying something and placing an order.That's right. You have to wait for it. So it's a good, formal, professional way to say "order."

# 3.bring up [phr.调出、打开]
> 1)Right. And that's what this means, "to bring up something" means "to open it" on a computer screen.So if you can imagine Amy, she's in her office, she's looking at her screen. She needs to know more about this company Office Supplies Wholesalers. So she opens the client information.Or brings it up in her system.

> 2)sometimes like, if we're talking to someone, and we want to talk about a topic, we can say "bring up that topic," right?

> 3)Yeah, like, oh you brought it up, stop talking about that. Well, this is not that meaning. This just means open a computer program or an app or something like that.

# 4.system 
> 1)so you guys probably know "computer system," maybe "operating system" like your iPhone or your whatever phone that you use has an operating system.I mean if you're talking about computers, when your computer crashes, you could say "the system crashed."

> 2)we also use "system" to talk about a way that we organize our lives right.that reminds me of my friend actually. He has a terrible memory, so he needs a system to remember things. So if he doesn't want to forget something, he has to write it down and on his phone or on his hand, and that's a system that works for him.

# 5.running low [phr.即将用尽] & run out of 
> 1)It means "almost run out of." You could also say "be low on." You could say "we are low on paper."Right, but we usually say "running low on."Yeah exactly. Now also, this is usually in the present progressive tense, like you see it here, "we are running low." You could say "we run low," but that sounds really strange.And we use the preposition "on" if there's an object.Yeah, like paper, "run low on paper." But if we don't have an object, we could just say "paper is running low."

> 2)like when there's no more milk at home, you say "I ran out of milk." 

# 6.ink 
> 1)Ink is what you use to write things on paper, like in a pen. A pen has ink, right?

> 2)Or a printer, or a photocopier. Those use ink, too.but these days, those new kinds of printers, those laser printers, they don't use ink.

# 7.promotion on sth  [n.促销] & sale 
> it's an activity to advertise something usually in the form of a sales discount.So if I say, "Hey, there's a promotion down at the store." That usually means there's a sale.

# 8.stock up [phr.大量囤积]
> "Stock up" means buy a lot of things for later, because you're going to use them later.
You might be buying it because the price is good, so you want to stock up. Or you might not be able to get more later, so you have to stock up now.

# 9.just to be safe
> This phrase means to be careful to avoid something unpleasant. We use this phrase to explain why we’re doing something. Since we use this phrase so often, there are many variations of it. 

***（just） to be on the safe side.出于安全考虑***

***（just） in case.以防万一***

***（just） to be sure.保险一点***

***（just） for good measure.保险起见***

# 10.purchase /'pɝtʃəs/ [n. & v.]
> 1)So just to be safe, Charles asks for four more packs of those, and Amy says, "Okay, I've added those to your purchase."

> 2)it's "a purchase." And the verb that we say when we use "purchase" as a noun is "make." You can make a purchase.

# 11. rush delivery & standard delivery 
> 1)But if we get a rush delivery, that's the same as an express delivery. So your delivery is going to come more quickly, maybe in one or two days.

> 2)Standard delivery is just regular mail. It's gonna take, I don't know, five days, two weeks, three weeks... I don't know.

# 12.crucial [adj.关键的]
> As you said, it means very important. In fact, it's so important. Basically, it means you need it.And it also implies you need it because other things depend on it.Yeah exactly, like in this case, he needs ink and paper, maybe to run his business. That's crucial to his business.And he needs it before the weekend, so they obviously need to use this stuff before the end of the week.And let's get a couple more examples from this word "crucial." Like, these days climate change is being talked about all the time. It's really important. In fact, it's crucial that we take care of the environment so that climate change doesn't go out of control.That's right. And I also think of famous people and how they were crucial to the success of a business, like Steve Jobs for example. He was crucial to making Apple the company it is today.

# 13.invoice & receipt 
> 1)"Invoice" is just a list of things that you provided.And this word can be used as a noun or a verb. Like, for example, if I do some work for Connor, like paint his house, I can say "Hey Connor, I'll invoice you."that depends on how well the paint job you did on my house. Yeah, or you could say like, "send me an invoice" or you can request an invoice as well.So it's just finding out how much money you owe.

> 2)So it's different than a receipt, because we get a receipt after we've paid for something, but usually we get an invoice before we've paid for anything.
