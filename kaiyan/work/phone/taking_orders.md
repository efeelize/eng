# I.How to take orders by phone
> Be polite and gather all the necessary information to place the order. Complete the transaction /træn'zækʃən/ [n.交易] in a professional manner and promote customer satisfaction.

> Identify [vt.认出,识别] yourself and your place of business when you answer the phone. Never eat or drink when on the phone and speak clearly and slowly so the customer can understand you. Keep your voice on an even level[声音平稳].

> Listen carefully to the customer and write down any pertinent /'pɝtnənt/ [adj.有关的]information. Ensure you get all the necessary information to place the order, including the exact item[货品], specifications[规格], size[尺寸], and any other pertinent information. 

> Always repeat the customers' order back to them for verification /ˌvɛrɪfɪ'keʃən/ [核实,查对]. Make sure they are clear on the price for the item ordered to avoid the customer receiving an unpleasant surprise when they receive the bill.

> Ask the customers for their phone numbers so you can call them back if you have any questions about the order later. Wait for them to hang up the phone first so they do not hear the noise of the phone hanging up.
