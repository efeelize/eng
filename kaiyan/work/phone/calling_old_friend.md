# Calling a old friend
# I.Friendship, American style
> Americans have a third fewer [减少了三分之一] close friends and confidants /'kɑnfɪdænt/ [n.心腹朋友,知己] than just two decades ago - a sign that people may be living lonelier, more isolated lives than in the past.

> In 1985, the average American had three people in whom to confide matters that were important to them, says a study in today’s American Sociological Review[《美国社会学评论》]. In 2004, that number dropped to two, and one in four [四分之一] had no close confidants at all.

> "You usually don’t see that kind of big social change [社会变化] in a couple of decades [几十年的时间]," says study co-author [该研究的合著者] Lynn Smith-Lovin, professor of sociology at Duke University in Durham. Close relationships are a safety net, she says. "Whether it’s picking up a child or finding someone to help you out of the city in a hurricane, these are people we depend on."

> The study finds fewer contacts are from clubs and neighbors; people are relying more on family, a phenomenon documented in the 2000 book Bowling Alone [2000年出版的《独自打保龄》] by Robert Putnam, a Harvard public policy professor[公共政策课教授]. The percentage of people who confide only in family increased from 57% to 80%, and the number who depend totally on a spouse is up from 5% to 9%, the study found.

# II.grammar
# 1.get doing sth
> 1)it is a very colloquial way to say begin doing something, and you can use it with pretty much any activity.As a side note[附注], people often say “get/got to talking”, but you can think of that as an idiom, because the pattern “get to +v-ing” really doesn’t work with many other verbs.

> 2) this is such a common phrase here when you run into someone. I ran into Connor at the bar and we got talking and then we got drinking and then we got talking more.

- 1. Do you think we should get going soon? [尽快出发]

- 2. What are we all waiting for? Let's get moving! 

- 3. After our argument, I got thinking that she wasn't really the one for me.

# 2.peachy [adj.极好的] & cheesy /'tʃizi/ [adj.虚伪的] & corny /'kɔrni/ [adj. <非正>平淡的;过时的,陈旧的] & the worst is behind him [phr.最糟糕的已经过去了]
> 1)cheesy, corny you know these like food words that are usually pretty negative.

> 2)but peachy is a super positive word. Everything is peachy means everything is fine.basically peachy is like everything is just all good. usually we use these two words together everything and peachy. I hear that a lot, you see, you just hear everything is peachy.

# 3.can’t complain [phr.没什么可抱怨的] & holding up [v.应付] & beaten down [phr.沮丧] & go through [phr.经历]
> 1)so things are good, they're not bad, maybe they're not super great. But her life is okay.

> 2)so holding up here basically sounds like how is somebody doing after something bad happened.usually something really bad.Something bad basically maybe someone lost their job, lost a loved one something like that…and we pretty much always use this phrase like this like how are you holding up, how is he holding up?

> 3)Beaten down. So he basically doesn't look good. It's funny how we have holding up, right, like you have to hold yourself up you know like show the world that you are up here you are but sometimes life just keeps beating you down. Get down. so if you're up, you're doing well, if you're down, you're not doing well. If he, basically he needs to hold up the bad things that make him feel down, but he can't hold it too well, so it's pushing, it's beating him down.

> 4) So when you go through something, you are usually going through a bad thing. You said divorce, we could say go through a tough time. You can even just say to go through a lot, so it just means to deal with a lot of bad things. But here it says he's going through a bad divorce, so the divorce isn't over yet, he's still dealing with it.

> 5)So all the bad times are gone and now the good times are here. When you put the worst behind you, you basically just try to maybe forget all the bad things when you try to live life in the now. Enjoy life.life is full of ups and downs.

# 4.love life [n.感情生活]
> this phrase love life you guys have to use this phrase if you want to ask your friend "Do you have a boyfriend? Do you have a girlfriend?" Maybe not so much do you have one, but just like "How is your boyfriend? How is your girlfriend?"

# 5.hit the jackpot [phr.走运] & beau /bo/ [n.男友]
> 1)So hit the jackpot, I mean so like be really lucky to have something really good in your life. Jackpot can mean a lot of money but it can also just like here with her new boyfriend Beau. It just means that everything is great and she's super happy to have him.

> 2)It's a French word for like handsome handsome guy.Now Beau can be a name a guy's name like "Hi, my name is Beau." But we also use this just to mean boyfriend.
 
# 6.check in [phr.检查、确认]
> 1)of course we all know check into a hotel.

> 2)So he just wanted to check in which just means kind of like wanted to see how she's doing.Now it doesn't always have to be a friend checking in on another friend, it could be like parents calling home just to check in how are their kids doing? Is every thing ok? Is everything ok? Okay. We are just checking in.

# 7.it was great to hear your voice & get the old gang back together [phr.把我们那帮人齐聚一堂]
> 1)basically meaning this phone call is now over. Pretty much, it's it's almost over, it's almost over.

> 2)this is a great phrase here just got the old gang back together. It just means reunite with your friends.basically all your old friends you know your best friends get them all together again.
