# Calling a old friend
# I.Friendship, American style
> Americans have a third fewer [减少了三分之一] close friends and confidants /'kɑnfɪdænt/ [n.心腹朋友,知己] than just two decades ago - a sign that people may be living lonelier, more isolated lives than in the past.

> In 1985, the average American had three people in whom to confide matters that were important to them, says a study in today’s American Sociological Review[《美国社会学评论》]. In 2004, that number dropped to two, and one in four [四分之一] had no close confidants at all.

> "You usually don’t see that kind of big social change [社会变化] in a couple of decades [几十年的时间]," says study co-author [该研究的合著者] Lynn Smith-Lovin, professor of sociology at Duke University in Durham. Close relationships are a safety net, she says. "Whether it’s picking up a child or finding someone to help you out of the city in a hurricane, these are people we depend on."

> The study finds fewer contacts are from clubs and neighbors; people are relying more on family, a phenomenon documented in the 2000 book Bowling Alone [2000年出版的《独自打保龄》] by Robert Putnam, a Harvard public policy professor[公共政策课教授]. The percentage of people who confide only in family increased from 57% to 80%, and the number who depend totally on a spouse is up from 5% to 9%, the study found.

# II.grammar
# 1.get doing sth
> it is a very colloquial way to say begin doing something, and you can use it with pretty much any activity.As a side note[附注], people often say “get/got to talking”, but you can think of that as an idiom, because the pattern “get to +v-ing” really doesn’t work with many other verbs.

- 1. Do you think we should get going soon? [尽快出发]

- 2. What are we all waiting for? Let's get moving! 

- 3. After our argument, I got thinking that she wasn't really the one for me.

***Hey Crystal, it's Jesse!***

***Jesse? I barely recognized your voice! It's been forever.***

***I know, right? How have you been?***

***Everything's just peachy here. How about you?***

***Can't complain. I ran into James the other day and we got talking about you.***

***How's he holding up?***

***Honestly, he looks pretty beaten down. He's been going through a bad divorce.***

***Oh no that's awful.***

***Yeah, but it sounds like the worst is behind him. Are you having more luck in your love life?***

***Haha, yes think I hit the jackpot with my new beau. He's really wonderful.***

***You totally deserve that. Listen, I have a meeting to get to, I just really wanted to check in.***

***Okay well it was great to hear your voice, Jesse!***

***Likewise! We should try to meet up soon. Get the old gang back together.***

***That sounds like a plan! Bye for now!***
