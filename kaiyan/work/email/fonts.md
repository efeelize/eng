- 3. Please underline the names of everyone attending the presentation.

# III.pattern
***Hi Sam, can I run something by you about my PowerPoint presentation?***

***I’m just wondering which fonts would be most appropriate.***

***Well, I have done a few presentations in my day. Which ones have you used so far?***

***I’ve included a lot of Arial and Calibri, but I don’t know if those are suitable.***

***I personally prefer to use Times New Roman because I find it more professional.***

***So you wouldn’t recommend the ones I’ve used?***

***Arial is fine, but Calibri and Cambria are more often used for websites.***

***What about Verdana for headers?***

***I would keep it consistent, just bold the headers or change them to another color. But don’t get too flashy.***

***Thanks so much! Those are great pointers!***

***As long as you don’t use Comic Sans or Wingdings, you should be good to go.***
