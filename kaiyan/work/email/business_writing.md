> Welcome to today’s seminar on “Effective Business Writing”[高效商务写作]. This is a two-part presentation and tomorrow we’ll continue with part two…Well, I’m Diana from the Economics Department[经济学院] at JR University. In today’s presentation, I will teach you ways of writing simple and short emails, letters, proposals, etc.

> Nowadays, information moves at the speed of light [以光速传播] through email. People don’t have time to read every email word for word. So we have to change the way we write in a business environment.

> First, I want to talk about the reader. Take time to tailor [润色] your writing for your audience. In the outline [大纲] you have on this talk, you’ll see all the different personality types and learning styles. Study them and write based on those theories. Next, I’ll talk about nine strategies that will improve your business writing.

> The Shirtsleeve /ˈʃɚtˌsliv/  Strategies [切合实际的策略] are broken down into [分为] nine parts. The first strategy is to use short and familiar words. Write in a clear and concise manner[用简洁的书写方式]. Don’t use convoluted /'kɑnvəlutɪd/ words to impress your reader.[不要用令人费解的词试图让对方对你刮目相看。]

> The second strategy is to get rid of redundant words and phrases[摒弃不需要的词]. Redundant words are often used in everyday language..One example of an everyday redundancy is “Free Gifts.” A gift is always free and if it’s not free then it’s not a gift. The word “Gifts” is enough to convey the meaning.[表达其含义]

> The third strategy is to eliminate wordy language. An example of a time-waster is “on a daily basis.” “Daily” works just as well as “on a daily basis.”

> The fourth strategy is to avoid unnecessary formalities /fɔr'mæləti/ [n.拘泥形式] and clichés[n.陈腔滥调]. Write in a conversational tone[用平时说话的语气写]; don’t write anything you wouldn’t say in person.

> Strategy number five is to write in a positive tone. People respond better when written to in a positive tone; negativity can cause reader opposition.

> The sixth strategy is to be specific[一针见血、直击要害]. Terms that are vague /veɡ/ [adj.含糊的] can cause confusion instead of giving readers precise information.

> The seventh strategy is to avoid jargon[避免过于专业的行话]. Uncommon jargon can be unfamiliar to the reader and result in confusion.

> The eighth strategy is to make items parallel[每条项目平行列举]. When writing is parallel, readers absorb information more rapidly and have more clarity.

> The ninth strategy is to keep terms consistent[用词保持一致]. Changing terminology /ˌtɝmə'nɑlədʒi/ [n.术语] can lead to confusion. Ok, that’s it for the Shirtsleeve Strategies and the end of today’s presentation. Remember, the second part of this seminar is tomorrow at 8 o’clock.Thank you and are there any questions?

# II.presentation
> Hello! Today we’re continuing our presentation on “Effective Business Writing.” For all of those who weren’t here for part one, my name is Diana and I am from the Economics Department at JR University. Today we’ll be talking about ways to make business writing effective in the fast-paced world of Business.

> So, the first point we’ll talk about is to use powerful language when writing. First, you must use an active voice [主动语态] in your writing. When you use an active voice it takes less time for the reader to process than when using a passive voice[被动语态].

> Secondly, use verbs and don’t turn them into nouns. Turning verbs into nouns will make it harder for the reader to process what they are reading. Lastly, avoid sounding like you’re not sure. For example, “I feel that this report could use….” sounds weak. “This report needs….” sounds a lot stronger. The next point is to keep it simple!

> The first step to keeping it simple is to write shorter sentences. Keep your business writing at about 8-11 words per sentence. Don’t write run-on sentences[流水句].

> The second step is to get to the point. Your first sentence should be powerful enough to keep the reader interested. And your last sentence should emphasize the purpose of the letter. Now, we will talk about how to write effective emails.

> The first step to writing effective emails is to make your page visual[让你的页面视觉上舒适]. Use lists[列表], headings[标题], labels[标签], underlining[下划线], spacing[空格] and bolding[粗体] to direct the reader’s eye to important information.

> Make sure to always write an attention-grabbing [有吸引力的] subject line. Put specific information on the subject line of an email. Make sure it catches the reader’s attention. And remember to keep the email short and write the way you would speak. Also, to avoid puzzling readers keep the email to one subject.

> Next, write a message that shows the right tone; you don’t want any misinterpretations.[误解] Don’t write anything that’ll sound like you’re trying to pick a fight with the reader.[挑读者的刺的语气] Also, remember to proofread [v.校对] your email. And lastly, use email shorthand[缩写]. Using BTW can shorten words like, by the way.

> Well that’s the end of our two-part presentation. I hope you found this presentation useful and make sure to start using these tips today!

# III.grammar
# 1.transition words [连接词]
> Transition words can help give your writing sequencing /'sikwənsɪŋ/ [n.先后顺序] order. You use sequencing to make more sense and to give order to your writing.

- 1. Firstly, we will mention the effects on getting a heart transplant. [心脏移植]

- 2. Lastly, I will cover what will be on the final exam. 

- 3. Next, I will discuss the problems with using iOS 6 on an old iPhone .

# 2.tailor 
> To tailor is to customize your writing to adjust it to your audience.

# 3.concise /kən'saɪs/ [adj.简洁的]  &  convoluted [adj.费解的]  &  redundant  & wordy language  &  unnecessary formality  &  cliches  /'kli:ʃei/  [n.陈词滥调]  & jargon /'dʒɑrɡən/ [n.行话] 
> 1)So this word "concise", this is very useful, it means short, but also it gets to the point, you don't use any unnecessary words.and it means exactly what you want to say, concise.

> 2) convoluted is like complicated, hard to understand, don't use hard to understand words to impress your reader.

> 3)So redundant, redundant is when you use words that are the same. so you're just repeating the same meaning again, for no reason, it doesn't help.

> 4)So wordy language means sentences that have too many words, too many unnecessary words.

> 5)so I have an example of unnecessary formality. So you can imagine this at the end of an email. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require additional information.you can just say please contact me,or just call me if you need more information.

> 6)Cliches are phrases that are overused, people overuse them too much.like at the end of the day,it just means in the end.

> 7)I think one time that we get jargon a lot is if you have an IT department and they are talking to other departments, when you talk about technical stuff, you know, RSS and CSS and others acronyms /'ækrənɪm/ [n.首字母缩略词] that other people don't know.and ROI,if you're businessman in Silicon Valley, you think that everyone knows what it means.So it means return on investment, so remember, don't use jargon, you'll just confuse your reader.

# 4.convey the meaning
> So to convey the meaning means to get the meaning across to communicate the meaning.

# 5.terminology /ˌtɝmə'nɑlədʒi/ [n.术语]
> So a term is a word, one term as one word. If you say terminology, it means a bunch of words.

# 6.passive voice [n.被动语态] & active voice [n.主动语态]
> 1)when use the passive voice you say things like '' it has been decided that,'' right? You don't say who decided, you just say it has been decided.Yeah, it's indirect. Another example would be some questions have been raised about.

> 2)so an active voice those would be we decided that.John raised a question about.You missed some deadlines, right? So when you make it an active voice sentence you have to decide who did it? Sometimes it's I, sometimes it's you, sometimes it's we. You have to decide that, but when you do this the sentence is actually easier for us to understand.

# 7.attention-grabbing [adj.引人注目的]
> you write important topics or messages on the subject line like this report is due next week.

# 8.shorthand [n.缩写]
> so there's some expressions that we use a lot, and it's just much easier and clearer to use these email shorthand expressions like BTW is the example she gives, it means by the way.
