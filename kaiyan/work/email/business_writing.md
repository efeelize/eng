# Effective_business_writing
# I.seminar
> Welcome to today’s seminar on “Effective Business Writing”[高效商务写作]. This is a two-part presentation and tomorrow we’ll continue with part two…Well, I’m Diana from the Economics Department[经济学院] at JR University. In today’s presentation, I will teach you ways of writing simple and short emails, letters, proposals, etc.

> Nowadays, information moves at the speed of light [以光速传播] through email. People don’t have time to read every email word for word. So we have to change the way we write in a business environment.

> First, I want to talk about the reader. Take time to tailor [润色] your writing for your audience. In the outline [大纲] you have on this talk, you’ll see all the different personality types and learning styles. Study them and write based on those theories. Next, I’ll talk about nine strategies that will improve your business writing.

> The Shirtsleeve /ˈʃɚtˌsliv/  Strategies [切合实际的策略] are broken down into [分为] nine parts. The first strategy is to use short and familiar words. Write in a clear and concise manner[用简洁的书写方式]. Don’t use convoluted /'kɑnvəlutɪd/ words to impress your reader.[不要用令人费解的词试图让对方对你刮目相看。]

> The second strategy is to get rid of redundant words and phrases[摒弃不需要的词]. Redundant words are often used in everyday language..One example of an everyday redundancy is “Free Gifts.” A gift is always free and if it’s not free then it’s not a gift. The word “Gifts” is enough to convey the meaning.[表达其含义]

> The third strategy is to eliminate wordy language. An example of a time-waster is “on a daily basis.” “Daily” works just as well as “on a daily basis.”

> The fourth strategy is to avoid unnecessary formalities /fɔr'mæləti/ [n.拘泥形式] and clichés[n.陈腔滥调]. Write in a conversational tone[用平时说话的语气写]; don’t write anything you wouldn’t say in person.

> Strategy number five is to write in a positive tone. People respond better when written to in a positive tone; negativity can cause reader opposition.

> The sixth strategy is to be specific[一针见血、直击要害]. Terms that are vague /veɡ/ [adj.含糊的] can cause confusion instead of giving readers precise information.

> The seventh strategy is to avoid jargon[避免过于专业的行话]. Uncommon jargon can be unfamiliar to the reader and result in confusion.

> The eighth strategy is to make items parallel[每条项目平行列举]. When writing is parallel, readers absorb information more rapidly and have more clarity.

> The ninth strategy is to keep terms consistent[用词保持一致]. Changing terminology /ˌtɝmə'nɑlədʒi/ [n.术语] can lead to confusion. Ok, that’s it for the Shirtsleeve Strategies and the end of today’s presentation. Remember, the second part of this seminar is tomorrow at 8 o’clock.Thank you and are there any questions?

# I.presentation
> Hello! Today we’re continuing our presentation on “Effective Business Writing.” For all of those who weren’t here for part one, my name is Diana and I am from the Economics Department at JR University. Today we’ll be talking about ways to make business writing effective in the fast-paced world of Business.

> So, the first point we’ll talk about is to use powerful language when writing. First, you must use an active voice [主动语态] in your writing. When you use an active voice it takes less time for the reader to process than when using a passive voice[被动语态].

> Secondly, use verbs and don’t turn them into nouns. Turning verbs into nouns will make it harder for the reader to process what they are reading. Lastly, avoid sounding like you’re not sure. For example, “I feel that this report could use….” sounds weak. “This report needs….” sounds a lot stronger. The next point is to keep it simple!

> The first step to keeping it simple is to write shorter sentences. Keep your business writing at about 8-11 words per sentence. Don’t write run-on sentences[流水句].

> The second step is to get to the point. Your first sentence should be powerful enough to keep the reader interested. And your last sentence should emphasize the purpose of the letter. Now, we will talk about how to write effective emails.

> The first step to writing effective emails is to make your page visual[让你的页面视觉上舒适]. Use lists[列表], headings[标题], labels[标签], underlining[下划线], spacing[空格] and bolding[粗体] to direct the reader’s eye to important information.

> Make sure to always write an attention-grabbing [有吸引力的] subject line. Put specific information on the subject line of an email. Make sure it catches the reader’s attention. And remember to keep the email short and write the way you would speak. Also, to avoid puzzling readers keep the email to one subject.

> Next, write a message that shows the right tone; you don’t want any misinterpretations.[误解] Don’t write anything that’ll sound like you’re trying to pick a fight with the reader.[挑读者的刺的语气] Also, remember to proofread [v.校对] your email. And lastly, use email shorthand[缩写]. Using BTW can shorten words like, by the way.

> Well that’s the end of our two-part presentation. I hope you found this presentation useful and make sure to start using these tips today!

# I.Buzzwords and their definition
> Buzzwords are terms and phrases that sound impressive, cool, or even exciting, but not everyone always understands the definition of them.

> Buzzwords can either be cringe /krɪndʒ/ -worthy[让人难堪], overused, or irrelevant, or they can be valuable and have merit. Ultimately, there are a lot of buzzwords in the business world – especially in marketing, sales, and service.

# 1.Big data [大数据]
> The massive collection of structured [大量结构化] and unstructured data [非结构化数据] that is often difficult to process through traditional means[很难通过传统方法处理]. Data collected from mobile, web browsing, voice data, etc.

# 2.Leverage
> It refers to the situation when one person has an advantage over another. Additionally, this term can be used when referring to taking advantage of a great opportunity or using a feature/product to its full extent.

# 3.Quota [配额]
> A target that sales reps try to reach over a certain period of time, often on a monthly or quarterly basis. A quota can be measured in both dollar amount or in number of deals closed.

# 4.Customer lifecycle [客户生命周期]
> A customer lifecycle outlines the stages a prospect goes through before, during, and after completing a transaction with a company [潜在客户在与公司完成交易之前、期间和之后经历的各个阶段]. Number of stages can vary depending on your business and industry.[根据你的业务和行业，阶段的数量可能会有所不同]

# IV.Buzzwords you need to forget 
# 1.Digital transformation
> This seemingly cutting-edge [前沿] phrase dwells /dwɛl/ [vi.居住,住] in obscurity /əb'skjʊrəti/ [n.晦涩或不明的事物]. It's a throwaway /'θroəwe/ [宣传小册子] line. Instead of using it as a blanket statement of your technological intentions, be specific. Talk about how your teams will use artificial intelligence [人工智能] or cloud-based platforms [云的平台]. Without context, "digital transformation [数字变革]" says little.

# 2.Crushing it [干得漂亮]
> You'd be surprised how often people say this. Even if they use it ironically [讽刺意味], "crushing it" always sounds a little too macho /'mɑtʃo/ [adj.大男子气概的]. If you or someone else has done an amazing job, be forthcoming and explain why.

# 3.Girl boss
> It is believed that woman's leadership should not be diminished /də'mɪnɪʃ/ [adj.减少了的,被贬低的] by qualifying her position with a gender-focused term [聚焦性别]. If you feel like it's a good way to recognize a leader like Arianna Huffington [《赫芬顿邮报》], then maybe you should also start referring to Jeff Bezos as a "boy boss."

# II.grammar
# 1.transition words [连接词]
> Transition words can help give your writing sequencing /'sikwənsɪŋ/ [n.先后顺序] order. You use sequencing to make more sense and to give order to your writing.

- 1. Firstly, we will mention the effects on getting a heart transplant. [心脏移植]

- 2. Lastly, I will cover what will be on the final exam. 

- 3. Next, I will discuss the problems with using iOS 6 on an old iPhone .

# 2.tailor 
> To tailor is to customize your writing to adjust it to your audience.

# 3.concise /kən'saɪs/ [adj.简洁的]  &  convoluted [adj.费解的]  &  redundant  & wordy language  &  unnecessary formality  &  cliches  /'kli:ʃei/  [n.陈词滥调]  & jargon /'dʒɑrɡən/ [n.行话] 
> 1)So this word "concise", this is very useful, it means short, but also it gets to the point, you don't use any unnecessary words.and it means exactly what you want to say, concise.

> 2) convoluted is like complicated, hard to understand, don't use hard to understand words to impress your reader.

> 3)So redundant, redundant is when you use words that are the same. so you're just repeating the same meaning again, for no reason, it doesn't help.

> 4)So wordy language means sentences that have too many words, too many unnecessary words.

> 5)so I have an example of unnecessary formality. So you can imagine this at the end of an email. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require additional information.you can just say please contact me,or just call me if you need more information.

> 6)Cliches are phrases that are overused, people overuse them too much.like at the end of the day,it just means in the end.

> 7)I think one time that we get jargon a lot is if you have an IT department and they are talking to other departments, when you talk about technical stuff, you know, RSS and CSS and others acronyms /'ækrənɪm/ [n.首字母缩略词] that other people don't know.and ROI,if you're businessman in Silicon Valley, you think that everyone knows what it means.So it means return on investment, so remember, don't use jargon, you'll just confuse your reader.

# 4.convey the meaning
> So to convey the meaning means to get the meaning across to communicate the meaning.

# 5.terminology /ˌtɝmə'nɑlədʒi/ [n.术语]
> So a term is a word, one term as one word. If you say terminology, it means a bunch of words.

# 6.passive voice [n.被动语态] & active voice [n.主动语态]
> 1)when use the passive voice you say things like '' it has been decided that,'' right? You don't say who decided, you just say it has been decided.Yeah, it's indirect. Another example would be some questions have been raised about.

> 2)so an active voice those would be we decided that.John raised a question about.You missed some deadlines, right? So when you make it an active voice sentence you have to decide who did it? Sometimes it's I, sometimes it's you, sometimes it's we. You have to decide that, but when you do this the sentence is actually easier for us to understand.

# 7.attention-grabbing [adj.引人注目的]
> you write important topics or messages on the subject line like this report is due next week.

# 8.shorthand [n.缩写]
> so there's some expressions that we use a lot, and it's just much easier and clearer to use these email shorthand expressions like BTW is the example she gives, it means by the way.

# II.grammar
# 1.第三条件句型
> It describes a past hypothetical situation (a situation that didn't happen) resulting from a previous situation. It is often used when talking about regrets or wishes.

## 13.1 主语 + could/would have + 过去分词 + if + 主语 + 过去完成时

- I could've passed the test if I'd studied harder.

- I wouldn't have slept in if I had gone to sleep earlier.

## 13.2 if + 主语 + 过去完成时 + 主语 + could/would have + 过去分词

- If I had known this was a formal event, I would have dressed nicer.

- If I had gone to sleep earlier, I wouldn't have slept in.


# 1.something needs doing...
> When we want to express what an object needs, we often use the phrase "something needs doing." Some examples from our daily lives might include "the laundry needs doing," "the dishes need washing," or the "bed needs making."

> We can see a slightly more advanced use of this phrase in our dialogue: The envelope needs pushing. This is just a play on the phrase "push the envelope" and in fitting with the theme of our lesson sounds a bit like a buzzword!

- 1. Honey, what time are you coming home? The dog needs walking. [狗需要遛一遛]

- 2. Could you help us while we're on vacation? Our plants need watering. [植物需要浇水]

- 3. If you can't see where you are walking, your hair probably needs cutting.[头发可能需要修剪]

# 2.cram in  [v.塞入、挤入]
> so "cram in" basically means to force, to put something in with force, something that's maybe a bit too big. I think of when I go traveling, I pack my suitcase and I keep wanting to put more stuff in. I try to cram too much stuff into my suitcase.And in this speech, it seems like the CEO crammed too many of these buzzwords in.

# 3.think outside the box [phr.跳出思维定式]
> "Think outside the box." This is a really old one, isn't it?I mean somewhere in the nineties, maybe it was a tech company or I think Apple, right? Apple always said think different.But thinking outside the box really just means think in a different way."the box" kind of means tradition. So really, this just means be creative.

# 4.life cycle [n.生命周期]
> so "a life cycle" is a good phrase. You can almost see the word circle in there.and circles and cycles can be fairly similar. A cycle does not need to be a perfect circle, but it does kind of go around and around like a circle.Right, but you can also think about the life cycle of a product. 

# 5.cliché & buzzword & slang /slæŋ/ & plain english 
> 1)this really just means overused phrase.in the beginning, it sounds really cool and original, but later it just sounds kind of not interesting.

> 2)basically, the difference between a buzzword and a cliché. Cliché has been around for a long time.sometimes maybe it's because they're true, as well.It's just that we're kind of bored of hearing them.

> 3)there's a little difference between a buzzword and slang. Now buzzword is usually a smart sounding word or a higher level word and they've become popular while slang doesn't make you sound smart.

> 4)So we always say plain English; we don't say simple English, because that kind of sounds like you're not very smart.Plain English just means the words that everybody can understand.

# 6.take actionable steps [phr.采取行动] & push the envelope [phr.挑战极限]
> 1)"Take actionable steps." This just means take practical steps.And we keep going back and forth with this idea of buzzwords being new and clichés being old. I don't remember the word "actionable" when I was a kid. no, neither did I. I don't think anyone ever said it.

> 2)"Push the envelope." Okay, basically, instead of thinking outside of the box, it's almost like making the box bigger.you're trying to push the limits of the box.at work, we always use this phrase when we're talking about science and technology.

# 7.collaborate & get along 
> 1)in fact, we use it a lot in our lessons, so you know, we don't really want to tell you guys don't use it. It's just that if you are in an office, my goodness, are you going to hear this a lot! it's really just "work together, help each other, you know, work closely."We have been asked a few times what's the difference between collaborate and cooperate. Truth is, with cooperation or cooperating, you don't really need to work all that closely.

> 2)Get along or just have some kind of agreement, whereas like Connor says, this one really means work closely with.

# 8.do sth with nuance /ˈnuˌɑns/ [n.细微差别]
> 1)so it's kind of an uncountable noun.so this is another French word. "Nuance," it really just means looking at the details carefully.So, we can say do something with nuance, but we also use this a lot as an adjective "nuanced." We're having a nuanced conversation where we are talking about the details.

> 2) the opposite of a nuanced conversation or a nuanced idea is a black and white conversation. You are either team A or team B. Well, you know, life has a lot of room for nuance.In fact, it's usually a lot of gray area.Exactly, that's what comes to mind, too. So, if anyone ever tries to tell you that life is black and white, you can either say, "No, no, there's lots of gray area." Or you can say, "There is a lot of nuance."

# 9.synergy /'sɪnɚdʒi/ [n.协同作用;协同;增效] & synergistic [adj.] & synergize [v.]
> 1)So "synergy" is this thing that just appears or occurs when teams work well together. if we look at the beginning of the word, is S-Y-N. We get this idea of kind of being together, like sync. And this word is used in companies all times because companies are made of teams and teams work together. They can create more power if they work together.

> 2)So we tend to use this word in phrases like "they have synergy." "There's no synergy."

> 3) I've even heard the adjective "synergistic."

> 4)Synergize. Yeah, "let's synergize this meeting."

# 10.influencer [n.网红] & clickbaity [adj.标题党的] & clickbait [n.] & hashtag [#号] & YOLO (you only live once .及时行乐) & FOMO (fear of missing out )
> 1)It's used to describe someone who is popular or famous on social media.So you might even call them a social media influencer or an Instagram influencer.so it's mostly Instagram, but it could be other things like TikTok,but these influencers mainly influence us to buy things.

> 2)so this word here is two words put together: click and bait, with the suffix -y added to the end.so a click is talking about like a mouse click or clicking on your phone; bait is the thing you put on the end of a fishing line when you go fishing to try to catch some fish.so just like a fisherman tries to catch fish, these influencers try to catch our clicks, I guess by using bait, using attractive things that we want to click on.So this is when we see a news headline or we're trying to choose a video and it promises that something really exciting and interesting. But then, when we click on it or read it, it didn't give us what it promised.

> 3)Clickbait is a noun, but we often use this new word "clickbaity" as an adjective to describe something that feels a bit clickbaity, is that really what this video is about?

- 1. I saw an article online that promised three free tips to make a million dollars, but then doesn't actually give you tips. It's just clickbait. 

- 2. When I look through videos on YouTube, I see a lot of clickbaity video thumbnails. [诱骗点击的视频缩略图] 

- 3. Facebook is full of clickbait, so you have to be careful.

> 4)So hashtag is the number sign. It's on the bottom right of the telephone keypad. It's that little symbol that we use a lot in social media, like on Instagram or Douyin, TikTok, and it just describes the subject of that posting like what is it about.It's like a label or a title. So before you read the article or whatever you can kind of get an understanding of what it's about.just remember guys, we always use the symbol. We don't write "hashtag" in our message. We put the hashtag symbol.

> 5)it just means to live your life to the fullest. You only live one time, make the most of it.even if something is scary, you should do it because you only have one chance. You only live once like, for example, skydiving.

# 11.superfoods [n.超级食品（对健康非常好的食品）] & vegan [adj.严格素食主义的]
> 1）So we were just talking about some internet buzzwords, but now we're on a food buzzword here. Superfoods are foods that we consider super super healthy.the reason this is an overused buzzword is because really it just means healthy food.Examples of this, blueberries, salmon, something we call quinoa /'kinwɑ/ [n.奎奴亚藜(产于安第斯山脉地区,印第安人种植,食用其粟)] or kale /kel/ [n.羽衣甘蓝], which is like spinach /'spɪnɪtʃ/ [n.菠菜].

> 2)And vegan is kind of like vegetarian, but more. Vegan can be an adjective or a noun. A vegan doesn't eat any products that came from animals, anything at all, even like the hair, even if you didn't kill the animal, so that includes milk and eggs and everything.they won't even use soap, because some soaps have animal products in them.Now vegan is not our overused buzzwords for today, but it is included in this lesson today.

# 12.I thought/said to myself [phr.我心想] & woke [adj.清醒的] & triggered [ptcp.触发、引起]
> 1）it like kind of when we're judging things or other people. Sometimes we even just say "I said to myself."let's look this expression "I thought to myself "really quickly. He could have said "I thought," but when we say "I thought to myself," it just emphasizes that we did it quietly and to ourselves.

> 2)Sam says, "I bet she's pretty woke too." Now "woke" is the past simple tense of the word "wake," like "I woke him" or "I woke my dog up." That's what woke means, but it's used as an adjective here.because this word isn't talking about getting out of bed, it's talking about being aware of big issues in society and not ignoring them.That's the way a lot of people are using this word these days, sort of means that you're awake to or you're aware of lots of problems in the world. And this could be a good word depending on who you talk to, but it could also be a little bit arrogant if I say, "Oh, Johnny. I'm so woke. I know what's going on in the world. I am so much better than everybody else."

> 3)A trigger is a part of a gun. You pull the trigger, the gun goes bang. But it also just means an event or something that causes something else to start, like when you go in the sunshine, the sun triggers your body to make vitamin D and that's why it's called the sun vitamin.

> 4) if you get triggered that means you react to things you read or see or things people tell you.but in the same way, when we see something or hear something that makes us react, it's starting something in us and that's why it's called the trigger.

> 5)Usually the word triggered, as an adjective here, is used by like psychologists for people who have real serious mental health problems. So that's why this is an overused buzzword is because it's just being used so much.

# 13.a little & a few
> 1)A little is used with uncountable nouns[不可数名词], such as water. But in this dialogue we see it used differently. A little is used with the adjective “more formal.” [A little和形容词“more formal”连用] Here is another example of a little being used with an adjective:

- Can you make it a little spicier?

- She had a little more fun once her friends arrived.

> A few is used with countable nouns[可数名词]. Countable nouns mean that when the noun is plural numbers can be used in front of it[复数情况下前面能加上数字表示数量的名词]. If that’s the case, then a few can also be used with it. For example:

- I have 12 documents = I have a few documents.

- They want a few copies of this page.

- Sally has a little more patience than Dan.

# 14.formatting [v.排版] & format painter [n.格式刷]
> 1）And then he talks about the formatting. So when he says formatting, he's talking about the text and he means the font, if it's bold or italic, if it's too big or too small. The color, all of this is formatting.So he tells her that she needs to adjust the formatting. She needs to change it, she needs to fix it.

> 2)So format painter is a is a little tool in Word, right?

# 15.omit [v.忽略、删除]
>  So when we say omit, we mean delete, take it out.

# III.pattern
***How about that speech, John? Could the CEO possibly cram any more buzzwords in?***

***I just can't believe that people are still saying "think outside the box"!***

***I feel I've experienced the whole life cycle of that phrase, from buzzword to cliché.***

***Well, we all need to take actionable steps to push the envelope!***

***And if I hear the word "collaborate" or "disrupt" one more time, I'm gonna be sick!***

***Remember, we need to do all of this with nuance.***

***And synergy! How meaningless can you get... oh, hi Mr Smith.***

***Hello gentlemen! What did you think of the speech just now?***

***Oh, it was great sir. Patrick and I were just saying how the envelope needs pushing!***

***Agreed! It's time we started thinking outside the box. Ok, carry on gentlemen!***

# III.pattern
***Hey, how was your hot date last night?***

***I don't think she's my type. She couldn't stop using buzzwords like "influencer" and "clickbaity."***

***She sounds like a friend of mine who calls himself an influencer.***

***I'm sure he influences someone. So then she took me to a new restaurant that has all kinds of superfoods. I thought to myself, "You mean salads?"***

***Wow, I bet she's pretty woke, too.***

***Yep. When I ordered chicken wings, she said she was almost triggered because she's vegan.***

***Well I guess there won't be a second date!***

***Who knows, but it would've been nicer if she had spoken plain English.***

***Well, you meet all kinds of people in the dating game. You just gotta stay positive!***

***Yep, hashtag YOLO!***

# III.pattern
***Hey Jennifer, I took a look at the document. There are a few things that need to be revised.***

***Since this document is for a meeting, the title font should be a little more formal.***

***Good. Also, this data would be easier to comprehend if it was displayed as a table.***

***Ok. I’ll convert that information into a table.***

***Also, the formatting here is different from the rest. We need to adjust that.***

***This information is copied from another document. The document had a completely different format. I wasn’t able to change it.***

***You can use the format painter. It’s the icon that looks like a paintbrush. First, select the text whose format you want to copy, click on the format painter, and then select the text that you want to change. And there you go!***
