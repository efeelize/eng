# Email_footer
# I.email footer
> For example, if I'm sending an email to someone that maybe is not my best friend, and I don't want them to have my phone number or my home address. I don't want them to know where I live. Yeah, so if I don't want them to know where I live, maybe I don't… shouldn't have a footer.

> But at the same time, it looks more professional when you have a footer. If for example, if I'm sending an email to someone that I don't know, but I want to look very professional, I want to look like I know what I'm doing. Then having a footer makes your email look more professional. It makes it look more adult.

# II.grammer
# 1.content
> 1)So content is just what something is about, what... what's in it.So we can talk about a content of an email, the things that you said in the email. But we can also talk about the content of a class. If you went to class today, I can say, "Cynthia, what was the content of your class today?"

> 2)And we can also talk about food. So you can say, "What is the content of this pizza?" "Oh, it's really bad for you." or "It has lots of cheese." or something like that. So what's in it. The content was fine in this email but you should update your signature.

# 2.update
> Okay. So there's this word "update". That means to make something new or better or both. New and better.So we hear "update" a lot with computers. Right? You need to update your smartphone or you need to update the program. You need to download the new file and make it new and better.

# 3.signature
> So signature is just the sender's name. And it's... for the footer, it's at the end of the document.So we can use signature both for your name at the end of an email and when you write a name with a pen on important pieces of paper. Something like that.

> A lot of times we talk about signature when you write your name. Maybe you have a really important document or piece of paper. You're buying a new house and you have to write your signature at the end. At least in the United States, people write their signatures in something that we call cursive /'kɝsɪv/ [ n. 草书 ]. They write really fast and it's really pretty. 

# 4.footer[n.签名、页脚] / font[n.字体]
> So it's at the end of the document, it's a footer. And sometimes you can change the font as well. For one of my footer email addresses, it's my name or my signature, looks a little different from the rest of the text or the rest of the letters in the email.

> font:the style of the letter.The style of it. Exactly. So some of it may look a little more formal, professional. And some of it may look a little more casual, maybe cursory /ˈkə..səri/ [adj.草率的]. So those are one of… those are some of the things that you can do.

So you don't need to put your email address, but other things include your phone number, of course, or maybe your home address, I live on this street, this number in this city. You can also have things like your Skype number. Lots and lots of people have Skype these days. Is there anything else?Yeah, any way that people can get in contact with you. Your contact details.
