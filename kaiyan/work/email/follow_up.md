# I.Cold Email Writing Strategies
> Why are cold emails (and their older cousin cold calls) so cold? Because you don't know the person. You don't have the kind of warmth that comes with having already established a relationship with them. And although not everybody wants to read what a stranger has to say, cold emailing can still be remarkably effective. At the end of the day, it is a cheap way to grow your network, as long as you do it right!Here are a few tips for getting responses to your cold emails:

# 1.Write a good subject line(标题)
> This is going to be the first thing that the reader will see. If your subject line is not clear, they might not choose to continue reading. Likewise, try to keep it between 5-7 words. If it's more, then you've already wasted enough of their time.

# 2.Social proof
> Also called name-dropping（署名）. If you have worked for one of their colleagues, or someone that they would know, include that! Or, appeal to your reader's sense of competition. if you're emailing Coca-cola, cola, don't hesitate to mention that you have recently spoken to someone at Pepsi.

# 3.Short, sweet, and to the point
> This one gets repeated a lot（老生常谈）, but it is so important. Don't write a novel!

# 4.Keep it informal
> Emails are not letters! Try to strike a casual tone（语气）. If it's too formal, the reader will think you don't know how to do business. However, this is not an excuse to forget about（生疏） your spelling and grammar.

# 5.Call to action（呼吁）
> The thing that you are trying to get them to actually do, needs to be clear. What is the next step? What do you want them to do. You can't make them guess!

# II.grammer
# 1.follow up
> Follow-up basically means to, kind of like, you know, check in and go after something again.

# 2.account manager 
> "account" this means like clients or customers accounts.

# 3.leading expertise in data analytics(分析工具)
> The leading agency in digital advertising.leading means the top, the best.

> Analytics. Numbers, but but also the analysis of numbers. especially I mean, data it's most of the time its online data, right? So you need to know, you know, information about who is looking at your website?How often are they looking at your website?So you need to analyze this data.

# 4.pop-ups 弹出窗口

# 5.real-time 
> Real-time tracking to help you optimize your campaign along the way.Because may be if there's no real-time tracking, you know, maybe they could give you information every week, you know, maybe on Monday afternoon you will get information, but maybe you need the new information on Tuesday, so they give you real-time information means whenever you need it you can have it.Basically real-time let you know what's going on at that time.

# 6.digital efforts
> efforts,meaning,this person really tried hard.But here digital efforts is kind of like, you know, what she plans to do, right? OK, what what she hopes the company does maybe.

# 7.explore
> When I think about explore, I think about word going around outside looking for animals, but here we just mean talk about, right? Yeah, it still means look for, but he means, he's trying to look for ways that he can help her.Or look for ways that he can make money by helping her.

# 8.reach out 
> Reaching out also is literally, if you, you know, you take your hand and you extend it to grab something, you're you're reaching out, but here it means to, you know, call somebody or send an email ,or, you know, send a text to contact. 

## III.pattern
***I was wondering if you've had the time to review my previous email?***

> review means to like look at again.It kind of means have you seen my email?Or did you seen it once?

***let's say you have a bunch of ways that the company could help you, but there's like three big ways they could really help you. He will take those three big things out of all the others to show you, because they're most important.***

> Right. OK, so so what he is going to do for her is he is going to believe that she wants to, you know, read his email, and so instead of writing everything again, what he does for her is he outlines a few key areas where his company can help her.so he has outlined,which basically means summarized,we also say highlight,means the same thing.You need to find the key points,and just put them right there for her to see.

***So would you have time for a 20-minute call this week?***
> So next comes the the actual, you know, this is the whole point of the email here is this call to action here, right?And so during this call he wants to explore potential areas where we could be of help to you. Wow, this is kind of, I don't know.
