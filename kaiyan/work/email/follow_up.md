# I.Cold Email Writing Strategies
> Why are cold emails (and their older cousin cold calls) so cold? Because you don't know the person. You don't have the kind of warmth that comes with having already established a relationship with them. And although not everybody wants to read what a stranger has to say, cold emailing can still be remarkably effective. At the end of the day, it is a cheap way to grow your network, as long as you do it right!Here are a few tips for getting responses to your cold emails:

# 1.Write a good subject line(标题)
> This is going to be the first thing that the reader will see. If your subject line is not clear, they might not choose to continue reading. Likewise, try to keep it between 5-7 words. If it's more, then you've already wasted enough of their time.

# 2.Social proof
> Also called name-dropping（署名）. If you have worked for one of their colleagues, or someone that they would know, include that! Or, appeal to your reader's sense of competition. if you're emailing Coca-cola, cola, don't hesitate to mention that you have recently spoken to someone at Pepsi.

# 3.Short, sweet, and to the point
> This one gets repeated a lot（老生常谈）, but it is so important. Don't write a novel!

# 4.Keep it informal
> Emails are not letters! Try to strike a casual tone（语气）. If it's too formal, the reader will think you don't know how to do business. However, this is not an excuse to forget about（生疏） your spelling and grammar.

# 5.Call to action（呼吁）
> The thing that you are trying to get them to actually do, needs to be clear. What is the next step? What do you want them to do. You can't make them guess!

# II.grammer
# 1.follow up
> Follow-up basically means to, kind of like, you know, check in and go after something again.

# 2.account manager 
> "account" this means like clients or customers accounts.

# 3.leading expertise in data analytics(分析工具)
> The leading agency in digital advertising.leading means the top, the best.

> Analytics. Numbers, but but also the analysis of numbers. especially I mean, data it's most of the time its online data, right? So you need to know, you know, information about who is looking at your website?How often are they looking at your website?So you need to analyze this data.

# 4.pop-ups 弹出窗口

# 5.real-time 
> Real-time tracking to help you optimize your campaign along the way.Because may be if there's no real-time tracking, you know, maybe they could give you information every week, you know, maybe on Monday afternoon you will get information, but maybe you need the new information on Tuesday, so they give you real-time information means whenever you need it you can have it.Basically real-time let you know what's going on at that time.

# 6.digital efforts
> efforts,meaning,this person really tried hard.But here digital efforts is kind of like, you know, what she plans to do, right? OK, what what she hopes the company does maybe.

# 7.explore
> When I think about explore, I think about word going around outside looking for animals, but here we just mean talk about, right? Yeah, it still means look for, but he means, he's trying to look for ways that he can help her.Or look for ways that he can make money by helping her.

# 8.reach out 
> Reaching out also is literally, if you, you know, you take your hand and you extend it to grab something, you're you're reaching out, but here it means to, you know, call somebody or send an email ,or, you know, send a text to contact. 

# 9.like
> So like 5 minutes ago means about 5 minutes ago. 4 or 5 minutes ago. And you can also ask, "Did you check your email?"

# 10.attach a document
>  And also "I attached a document." So if you attach something to an email, you add a file or document. So you can attach a picture.Or a word document.

- She attached the file we need for the meeting.
- Did you attach the document to the email?
- I will attach the picture and email to you.

# 11.unmark[v.取消标记]
> Yeah, your email was trying to help you and it marked the mail as spam. So you can unmark it.Which is just telling your email that it's not spam. It's a good email and you do want it.Right, it's not spam so you unmark it and now you can read it.

# 12.forward an email
> Right, "to forward an email" means to send an email to someone else. You just sent a copy to another person forward.

# 13.CCed/CC
> But she tells him that she "already CCed the supervisors". This is one of those words what I say it's just email has its own language, "CC".Yes. "CC" is email word. It means to send a copy of the email to other people at the same time. So for example, I send Lisa an email. So you know, to Lisa but I also want my boss to see this email so I can CC my boss.So he will receive the email as well.Right, but it's not really for him so probably he will not reply. But he can see it because I CCed him.That CC box is underneath the "to-box."Right, so "to" and then CC I had part of the email. And so I said I can CC my boss. She said "I CCed the supervisors. "

- Will you CC me on the emial to John?[发给John的时候抄送我一下]
- He CCed me on all of his emails to our bosses.[他所有发给老板的邮件都抄送我了]
- I will CC you when I respond to her.[我回复她的时候会抄送你的]

> Right. OK, so so what he is going to do for her is he is going to believe that she wants to, you know, read his email, and so instead of writing everything again, what he does for her is he outlines a few key areas where his company can help her.so he has outlined,which basically means summarized,we also say highlight,means the same thing.You need to find the key points,and just put them right there for her to see.
