# 1.formal
> Formal, that's right. We want to be a little bit more formal when we're writing someone we don't really know too much.That's right, but we have to be careful, because sometimes you can be too formal. So what exactly does formal mean?So if you write a formal email, it's very proper, very respectful. So proper in the way that you wouldn't use colloquial /kə'lokwɪəl/ [adj. 口语的, 会话的] terms or phrasal verbs that are, you know, like that you would use with your friends.

# 2.being direct
> Now being direct means that you say exactly what you want or exactly what you're thinking. Ok, so maybe, if we're talking to this company you say: "Hi, I want this. I will pay this much, thank you, bye."So sometimes you need to be a little less direct and say nice things in an email.

# 5.To whom it may concern
> Alright, To Whom It May Concern. Remember that M there. Well, this is a very formal phrase, and we're going to take it as a phrase. And this is how you begin a formal letter.That's right, usually you start this letter if it's directed to maybe a company or someone not specific. You don't know that person's name, and you're just saying, you know, whoever is reading this letter, whoever it concerns.That's right. Well I could say: "Dear Marco," But in this case maybe I don't know who the name of the person I am writing this email to. It's a big company, there are many people. So if you don't know who you're writing to in a company or in an organization, you say: "To Whom It May Concern."

# 6.what's up
> What's up. It is the kind of thing I say with my friends, you know, Hey Marco, what's up!But I would never say this in a formal situation with a boss or with a, you know, an employer, or with a, in more serious situation.Exactly, especially if you're writing an email to a client, you don't really want to say what's up.No, never. So remember, this is spoken English with your friends, but not something you would write. 

# 7.you show some respect
> So the key here is that you have to show some respect.Not to give. You want to show respect to someone. Well, how do you show respect to? Well, the way that you act, your behaviors.

Play it safe.That's right, so that's the way that you would use this phrase that play it safe, to make a decision that doesn't have too much risk, or that you know that will work very well. And to close things off in another option to end the letter, we could say: "All the best." "All the best, Tracy."

# 9.Yours truly / Yours faithfully / All my love
> I would not use "Yours, truly." Maybe if you're trying to build a relationship with your client, and you're very honest, but it seems to me to be very personal.And if you want to have a romantic letter, you can say, you know, "All my love" or "Love" or "Yours truly" Or "Yours faithfully".we memorize that usually at the end of the email or the end of the letter, you say: "Yours, Marco." or "Yours truly, Marco." And although it is correct, it's not really appropriate for a professional setting.

# 10.Yours sincerely / Kind regards / Regards / Best regards
>  So I would say in that case, "Yours sincerely", or "Kind regards", or "Regards", which are a little bit more professional and less emotional. That's right, so just as a reminder, if you're signing off your email, or your letter and you're at an office or in your company, you want to say "Best" or "Best regards" That are some of the things that we talked about here today.
