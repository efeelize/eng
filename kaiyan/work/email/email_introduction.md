# Email_introduction
# I.grammar
# 1.would like
>  So, "would like" is a more polite way of saying, want. So, in her email Juanita Hill said, you want to help your staff improve their English.

# 2.staff
> So staff, these are employees. So, employees, their workers, they work for Jeremy and then "improved" means to make better, so maybe they speak a little bit of English, but they need to speak more, so, so Jeremy said that he would like to help his staff improve their English.

# 3.believe
> Robert then says, "I believe I can help." And "believe" in this sentence means I think I can help, but it's stronger than think.But I don't want to say I know I can help. So, I'm going to say I believe I can help.

# 4.could
> Could we meet in person to talk about this further? So "could", "could" means "can" but it's a more polite way of saying "can". So instead of "can", we have "could". You can also say, "Can we meet in person to talk about this further?" And then "in person" just means, in real life.

# 5.further
> So, they're talking about it through email but he want to actually sit down, meet him in person in real life and talk about this further. So "further" just means "more", wants to know more details maybe, how many people he would be teaching English to or when does he want him to start teaching English. So, talk about it more.

# 6.meet in person
> So, usually in these situations it's normal to say we should meet in person to talk about this further, of course, you can talk lots on email but sometimes it's better just to meet the person in person so that you guys can meet each other and talk some more and you actually meet the person, right? It's not just reading an email. Robert then says, "I'm available next week." So, "available" means free, that he has free time and can meet with Jeremy next week.
