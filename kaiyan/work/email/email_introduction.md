# Email_introduction
# I.reply email
> So, as we mentioned before you receive an email introduction from someone saying here, here's someone that you should get to know, that you should work with them or be friends with them, something like that. And this lesson we saw a good way of doing that, you send an email to this other person, you replied to the email.

# 1.short email
> hat are some tips or some good ways of replying to an email introduction. OK so, maybe one could be that it's a short email. It's not long. He doesn't say, "Dear Jeremy, how are you? How are things going today?" He gets straight to the point. He talks about why he's replying to this email.Exactly, you only say the things that you need to say, you don't need to talk about the weather or what your friend is doing or what you had for dinner that day. It doesn't matter. Just say you want this, I have this. Let's talk, straight straight straight forward.

# 2.very polite
> Related to this. It should be very polite. You don't know this person yet you're not friends with this person and so there're many ways that you can be polite in emails like this. One good way is to change the words, so for example, instead of saying "want", you could say "would like".Yeah, or instead of saying "can", you can say "could". It just sounds more polite.And after you meet this person in person and you guys know each other, then you can be more casual, but because you haven't met this person yet, it's probably better to be more polite.

# 3.Reply right away
> And another final and good tip is to reply right away. So, try responding to the email as soon as you see it, as soon as you get it, but usually try to respond the email within two days after you've received it.

# II.grammar
# 1.would like
>  So, "would like" is a more polite way of saying, want. So, in her email Juanita Hill said, you want to help your staff improve their English.

# 2.staff
> So staff, these are employees. So, employees, their workers, they work for Jeremy and then "improved" means to make better, so maybe they speak a little bit of English, but they need to speak more, so, so Jeremy said that he would like to help his staff improve their English.

# 3.believe
> Robert then says, "I believe I can help." And "believe" in this sentence means I think I can help, but it's stronger than think.But I don't want to say I know I can help. So, I'm going to say I believe I can help.

# 4.could
> Could we meet in person to talk about this further? So "could", "could" means "can" but it's a more polite way of saying "can". So instead of "can", we have "could". You can also say, "Can we meet in person to talk about this further?" And then "in person" just means, in real life.

# 5.further
> So, they're talking about it through email but he want to actually sit down, meet him in person in real life and talk about this further. So "further" just means "more", wants to know more details maybe, how many people he would be teaching English to or when does he want him to start teaching English. So, talk about it more.

# 6.meet in person
> So, usually in these situations it's normal to say we should meet in person to talk about this further, of course, you can talk lots on email but sometimes it's better just to meet the person in person so that you guys can meet each other and talk some more and you actually meet the person, right? It's not just reading an email. Robert then says, "I'm available next week." So, "available" means free, that he has free time and can meet with Jeremy next week.

# 7.looking forward
> And then the last line of the email says, "Looking forward to your reply." So, "looking forward to your reply" is usually a set phrase that you say when you're, when you're sending out an email and you're really excited about the person responding to your email, so "looking forward" just means I'm very excited. Reply is a response. So I'm looking forward, I'm very excited for your response.

# 8.getting further in doing sth [在某方面进一步...]

# III.pattern
