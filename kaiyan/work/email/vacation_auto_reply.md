# Vacation_auto_reply
> Before you go on vacation, it's really important to let your clients and customers know that you are not gonna be around. So today we're gonna be talking about how to write an auto-reply email.this is very useful for any time that you are out of office. So if you're sick, if you're on vacation or even if you're on a business trip. 

# 1.grammer
## 1.1 out of office
> so the phrase "out of office" is exactly as it sounds. It means when you're not around or not in the office physically.

## 1.2 communicate
## (1)meaning
> So when you communicate something, you tell someone something. But communicate is a little bit more formal, it's a little bit more professional, right?Yeah, that's right. It's better than saying "tell" or "say".

## (2)contact/communicate
>  "contact" just means, again like you're using the phone or email to communicate with somebody basically.mabey you need to contact your boss about a problem.

> Yeah, and a thing to note here, is that with "contact" you're not using any propositions. So I just contact my friend.

## 1.3 respone/reply to 
> And just to note here, when we use respond and reply, we use the proposition "to". So reply to an email or respond to an email. We need "to". Respond to your email. Reply to your email. 

# 2. pattern
> 1)how long you will be gone;2)when you will return ;3) who to contact if it's urgent.

***Hello. Thank you for your email. I will be on Chinese New Year vacation/holiday/leave from Feb 14th to Feb 22nd."***

> So always good to start with "thank you", "thank you for your email". Yeah, not "thank you your email", "thank you for". And then "I will be on Chinese New Year vacation". Now a key thing here is the preposition, here we're using on,not in or at,but on.

***I willl have limited access to email.***

> Limited access, so this sounds really formal and it is. It's very professional. Basically, it just means I can't get or receive email very much.Access means that you can check or you can get to your email.

***Howeve,I can be reached on my mobile phone.***

>  This is just a more polite and professional way to say contact.

***If you need immediate assistance during my absence, please contact this number.***

>  Immediate means right now or right away.Assistance just means to help someone, but it's a lot more formal and professional. This could be a number of someone who is in the office and not on leave.

***I will do my best to respond to your email as soon as I return.***
