Warning letter
# I.letter
Dear Adam,
This letter is a warning about your recent unsatisfactory job performance. We have received many complaints from your Department Head about your lateness. As well, we have observed you using office material for your own personal use several times. 

On July 12 in a meeting with your manager, you were warned verbally about your performance. At that time, you assured her that you would change your behavior. However, since then, you have not only been late on more than one occasion, but also you have been observed continuing to use office material inappropriately.

We consider your performance to be a serious breach of conduct. If you continue to act in such a manner, it will lead to further discipline, up to and including dismissal.

We hope that this letter will act as a warning to avoid problems in the future. We want you to know that we value you at The Company. If you feel that you are being treated unfairly, please let our HR Department know.

Please sign and date below, as a copy will be placed in your personnel file.

# II.grammar
# 1.Passive voice [被动语态]
> it is often used in formal writing to appear professional, dignified /'dɪɡnɪfaɪd/ [adj.庄严的] and impartial /ɪm'pɑrʃəl/ [adj.公平公正的] . For example: You were seen [doing something]”sounds much more professional than“I saw you doing something.”We can also soften the tone by changing the verb tense to a“you have been seen [doing something]”form (this is called the present perfect for you grammar geeks). Note that the meaning is the same. The difference is in the tone.

# 2.unsatisfactory [adj.令人不满意的] & inappropriately [adj.不合适]
> 1)This word is so office, so business.Yeah, just means if something first of all is satisfactory that means it' s good, that's good enough. It' s okay. So "un" of course means "not". Just not good, in other words, your rencent bad job performance. Alright, so "unsatisfactory", very common word. 

> 2)so that's "inappropriately" use not correct use of off majority used for work, for business.

# 3.we have observed  & you have been observed
> 1)more formal way is we have observed.. And this combination to "have observed". It makes not only more formal, it kind of, it makes it a little bit less, maybe direct. It makes it a little bit softer and some ways you can know it' s very formal start.

> 2) if you say "you have been observed", it' s longer because it' s longer, it sounds more distance and kind of more formal and some general sense, someone observed, someone from a far saw you doing this instead "we saw you". So it' s very common and this type of formal business language and even just a formal letter like this.

# 4.warn verbally [adv.]  &  verbal warning 
> so "verbally" meaning using words which just implies they met in person and they talked about this already, probably the same problems.. In most companies have that as actually a standard policy. At first it' s a verbal warning, your manager just says, "Hey! I saw you doing that. Don' t do it. Don' t let it happen again." And then you get a warning letter that' s kind of a more formal way of saying this is really bad and now we' re creating documents.

# 5.assured [v.保证]
> It’s a kind of like you promise that you will do sth. It means to make someone sure of something. I' m telling you you can be sure I will change my behaviour I promised.

# 6.breach of conduct [phr.行为不端]  &  a breach of sth
> 1)so this is even actually kind of legal. This is so formal that almost what we would consider a legal word so a breach of conduct. 

> 2)"A breach of something" just means a break. Something is been broken. And conduct is just fancy a formal way of saying behavior something you do.So this is a serious breaking of the type of behavior we expect from you thrift, possibly you did something really bad.

# 8.discipline [v.处理] & dismissal [n.开除]
> 1)Discipline might mean he has to personally check in with someone when he arrives at work, make sure he' s not late. He has to, every week, right at personal progress reports to show "I really care about this", "I'm staying on top of being late", "I didn't use any office of discipline".

> 2)To dismiss someone or something means to basically allow them to go.this is a more formal, a soft word because "dismiss" sounds like we' re allowing you to go.
