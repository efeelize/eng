# I.About the author
> Gilbert’s family had no television or record player when she was young, so she read and wrote her own books for entertainment.

> Gilbert's first book, Pilgrims, received the Pushcart Prize [普什卡特奖] and was a finalist for the PEN/Hemingway Award [海明威奖]. In 2002, her book The Last American Man received a National Book Award nomination.

> To finance her year of world travel for Eat, Pray, Love, she received a $200,000 publisher's advance after pitching the concept in a book proposal.

> Gilbert's fifth book, Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage, was released January 2010. The book is like a sequel to Eat, Pray, Love in that it takes up Gilbert's life story where her bestseller left off. Committed also reveals Gilbert's decision to marry Jose Nunes, a Brazilian man she met in Indonesia. On July 1, 2016, Gilbert announced that she and Nunes were separating.
