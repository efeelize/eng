# I.rise of she economy
# 1.Sizing the U.S. Gender Wage Gap
> In 1980, women earned 64 cents for every dollar that men made; today, the gap has shrunk to between 77 and 85 cents of every dollar. The underlying issues have shifted somewhat, with some factors, like educational inequality improving, and others like family caregiving responsibilities [照顾家庭的责任分工] beginning to move in the right direction.

> The rising ranks of single working women could help further close the pay gap in the U.S. More women are delaying marriage and childbirth, choosing to stay single or divorcing in their 50s and 60s. 

# 2.Women Control More Purse Strings
> As it stands [目前来看], women already control a large share of the U.S. consumer wallet. They contribute an estimated $7 trillion [7万亿美元] to the U.S. gross domestic product per year.

> Meanwhile, women are earning bachelor's degrees at a higher rate than men, and they are the primary breadwinner for nearly 30% of married households and nearly 40% of total U.S. households.

# 3.Women in Global Leadership
> The improvement in economic status may also come in part thanks to increasing influence globally in both politics and business. Today, women make up nearly 25% of the U.S. Congress, compared to just 2% in 1970. In the business world, more women than ever are serving as CEOs, board members and in other high-profile positions at top companies.

# II.grammar
# 1.that is to say/that is
> 1)It is frequently used to clarify or paraphrase an idea. It could be an idea that you have said yourself, or that someone else has said. It can also be used to correct what was previously said. 

> 2)Mostly, it's used in formal speech, but can be used casually, especially when you are joking about your situation.

- 1. We need fresh blood — that is to say, we need to hire some young, enthusiastic and creative employees. [我们需要新鲜血液——也就是说，我们需要招聘一些有热情、有创造力的年轻员工]

- 2. More needs to be done to make things fairer for small companies, that is to say, smaller companies should be given tax cuts. [要想为小企业营造更为公平的环境，我们还需要做很多努力，也就是说，需要给小企业减税]

- 3. We need to do more to empower women, that is, we need to do more to support them and provide them with the tools and resources they need to succeed. [想要赋予女性权利，我们需要做更多的努力，也就是说，我们需要做更多的工作来支持女性，为女性提供成功所需的工具与资源]

# 2.substantial /səbˈstænʃəl/ [adj.大量的,重要的] & marginal [adj.]
> 1)substantial means that it's a considerable amount,it's not a small number. it is also important.we often use it when we're talking about money.

- She earns a substantial amount at her job.

- If you look on a holiday table,there's usually a substantial amount of food.

> 2)the opposite is marginal,it is a number that often doesn't matter.it's small.

# 3.fueling /ˈfjuːəlɪŋ/ [ptcp.加强] & driving 
> 1)"fuel" seems like less of a direct cause. It's just sort of adding to the cause.So it's something that often keeps people's feelings and ideas active, It makes them stronger, but it doesn't necessarily cause them to have these feelings.it can be used for positive things, but it's often use for negative things.

- you could fuel someone's fear or fuel someone's anger.

> 2)both of these two words means to push sth forward.driving could be also causing.

# 4.empowerment /ɪmˈpaʊɚmənt/ [n.赋权] & empowered [adj.] & clout /klaʊt/ [n.影响力]
> 1)empowerment means to give sb power.you can empower people with knowledge or opportunities.

- 3. His opponents sought to disempower him through rumours of corruption.[对手为了削弱他的力量，散播了他腐败的谣言]

# 5.tap /tæp/ into [phr.发掘、进入；利用] & C-suite [企业高管层,如CEO、CTO、COO] & level the playing field [phr.创造公平竞争环境]

> 1)so "tap into" really makes me think about using resources or finding a way to use resources like, for example, to tap into an oil well.you would actually set up a tap and you would use this tap to take out the oil.

> 2)it's similar when you use it metaphorically too. For example, you can "tap into the female perspective," and this would mean asking women about their opinions and really using their opinions to help you market or create something for other women.

- 1. I was hoping to avoid tapping into my funds. [我希望不要动用我的资金]

- 2. As a company, we really encourage our employees to push the envelope and tap into their creative side. [我们公司非常鼓励员工超越极限，发挥自身创造力]

- 3. Luckily for them, they have a large amount of resources that they can tap into. [他们很幸运，有很多可以发掘利用的资源]

> 3)these are all the people at the top,but it's kind of long to say executives or to list all the different Cs,so we just say C-suite.

> 4)so often you need to level the playing field for markets,and that often means making things more fair for companies.it could be a very theoretical approach.

# 6.under- & over-

## 2)underappreciated [adj.未得到充分重视的，未得到正确评价的] & overappreciated
> So when I think of underappreciated, I often think of working mothers.or just working women in general or just the amount of labor that women have to do on a day-to-day basis. That is not only underrepresented in our economy, but also underappreciated by people in general.

# 7. translated /trænzˈleɪtɪd/ [v.转化]
> So "translated" can be used to say that something changes or perhaps transfers from one thing to another.I often think about theories. Some theories really don't translate well to actual practice. It sounds good in theory.

- 1. Can you give me any concrete examples of how you could translate this theory into practice? [你能给我举一些具体的例子，说明你如何把理论应用于实践吗？]

- 2. The skills that she learned as a public speaker translated well into her position as a brand ambassador. [她通过公众演讲掌握诸多技能， 帮助她胜任品牌大使一职]

***Ellen, as an expert in the "She economy," can you start by explaining the term?***

***It refers to the female-driven economy. Women are driving growth in sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare and financial services. In China, women account for 41% of the GDP.***

***That's substantial. What's fueling this trend?***

***Well, rising female empowerment and employment have certainly increased spending power, particularly for single working women.***

***Does it mean that women have more clout in society? Are they pressing companies to tap into the female perspective?***

***Certainly. However, despite growing economic power, women are still underrepresented and underappreciated in fields such as science and the C-suite.***

***So, that is to say, economic gains haven't exactly translated to wider employment gains for women?***

***Well, we have achieved a lot. But more still needs to be done to level the playing field.***

***Ok, do you have any concrete suggestions? Who should we be putting the onus on?***

***It requires concerted efforts from families, corporations and society as a whole.***
