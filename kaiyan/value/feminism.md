# I.shifting attitude and female empowerment 
> 2017 was a year of change for feminist politics world-wide. Milestones were made in cases against sexual harassment and attention was turned to long persisting issues of gender inequality. This years outlook continues that ethos /'iθɑs/ [n.(个人或团体的)气质,精神特质;思潮] with a number of changes already at play.

> First amongst these changes is Iceland’s ban on gender-biased pay. The law which came into effect on Jan 1, 2018 seeks to enforce equal pay via regulation through certification and Iceland’s Centre for Gender Equality. Failure to comply with the mandated standards [不遵守规定] will result in a fine of up to $497 USD per day. The move comes with growing awareness of inequality in the workplace and brings Iceland to the forefront in the battle against wage disparity.

> This year’s Golden Globe's speeches [金球奖演讲] were also heavily charged with wrongs that have been long ignored. Tensions ran high but the continuing dialogue has helped cement solidarity against sexual harassment and discrimination [持续的对话有助于巩固反对性骚扰和歧视的团结]. In particular, Oprah Winfrey’s [奥普拉·温弗瑞] words “their time is up” have been echoed [引起公众共鸣] and hailed as a call for female empowerment [赋予女性权力的呼吁].

> Outside of the Golden Globes, Hollywood’s dedicated stance /stæns/ [n.姿态；位置；立场] is playing out in theatres. With groundbreaking film’s like Marvel’s Black Panther, this year’s lineup is expected to showcase an increasing number of empowered female roles.

# I.rise of she economy
# 1.Sizing the U.S. Gender Wage Gap
> In 1980, women earned 64 cents for every dollar that men made; today, the gap has shrunk to between 77 and 85 cents of every dollar. The underlying issues have shifted somewhat, with some factors, like educational inequality improving, and others like family caregiving responsibilities [照顾家庭的责任分工] beginning to move in the right direction.

> The rising ranks of single working women could help further close the pay gap in the U.S. More women are delaying marriage and childbirth, choosing to stay single or divorcing in their 50s and 60s. 

# 2.Women Control More Purse Strings
> As it stands [目前来看], women already control a large share of the U.S. consumer wallet. They contribute an estimated $7 trillion [7万亿美元] to the U.S. gross domestic product per year.

> Meanwhile, women are earning bachelor's degrees at a higher rate than men, and they are the primary breadwinner for nearly 30% of married households and nearly 40% of total U.S. households.

# 3.Women in Global Leadership
> The improvement in economic status may also come in part thanks to increasing influence globally in both politics and business. Today, women make up nearly 25% of the U.S. Congress, compared to just 2% in 1970. In the business world, more women than ever are serving as CEOs, board members and in other high-profile positions at top companies.

# 2.“If” invitations
> “If” invitations are a friendly and casual way to invite a person to an event . Here the speaker expresses an intention or something that they have and asks the listener if they are interested. For example, in the sentence “ I’m going to Starbucks, if you want to come with me,” the initial segment expresses the speaker's intention and the if clause is the invitation.

> In these situations a section of the regular conditional sentence has been deleted in order to fit the speaker’s intention. In a typical conditional a person would say “I’m going to Starbucks. If you want to come with me you can” But, in the earlier sentence “you can” was deleted and the two clauses were joined to make one sentence.

***Hey. Do you guys get a half-day off for women on International Women's Day?***

***Nope! It's a regular work day for us. Why? Do women get time off in China?***

***Yup! Of course, not all women take the time off but they are entitled to it under law.***

***Interesting. I think we mostly just have rallies and conferences. Speaking of which, I'm attending a talk on sexism and feminism in the workplace today if you want to come along.***

***Why not? I've actually been reading up on gender equality and the pay gap issue. Apparently, some sources say women earn about 20% less than their male counterparts in the U.S.***

***Yeah, I heard about that. A lot of companies are trying to rectify that but there is still a glass ceiling, especially for female executives.***

***But I do think that some of the male dominated industries are trying to be more inclusive. The metoo movement has forced a lot of companies to step up.***

***Yea, that's definitely something I wish our company would work a little harder on.***

***Man! Don't even get me started!***

# III.pattern
***Ellen, as an expert in the "She economy," can you start by explaining the term?***

***It refers to the female-driven economy. Women are driving growth in sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare and financial services. In China, women account for 41% of the GDP.***

***That's substantial. What's fueling this trend?***

***Well, rising female empowerment and employment have certainly increased spending power, particularly for single working women.***

***Does it mean that women have more clout in society? Are they pressing companies to tap into the female perspective?***

***Certainly. However, despite growing economic power, women are still underrepresented and underappreciated in fields such as science and the C-suite.***

***So, that is to say, economic gains haven't exactly translated to wider employment gains for women?***

***Well, we have achieved a lot. But more still needs to be done to level the playing field.***

***Ok, do you have any concrete suggestions? Who should we be putting the onus on?***

***It requires concerted efforts from families, corporations and society as a whole.***
