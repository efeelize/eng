# Streaming_service & podcast

# I.the best podcasts to listen to right now.
# 1.News & Politics
> Opinion columnists [专栏作家] David Leonhardt, Michelle Goldberg and Ross Douthat debate every week on a different, timely topic [当下话题]. Though some stances /stɑ:ns/ [观点] will surely infuriate /ɪn'fjʊrɪet/ [激怒] listeners, everyone will learn how the other side thinks.

# 2.Interview
> The premise is simple: Comedian Chris Gethard talks on the phone to an anonymous listener for one hour. In each episode, Gethard offers a master class in empathy [展现强大的共情能力]. He subtly encourages callers to share more details about their lives while remaining respectful of their privacy. 

# 3.Culture
> If you care about the Oscars, you should probably be listening to Little Gold Men. The podcast runs throughout the year [全年无休], recording dispatches /dɪ'spætʃ/ from film festivals [各大电影节的报道] and focusing on television during Emmy season [艾美奖颁奖季]. 

# 4.History
> Journalists Michael Hobbes and Sarah Marshall revisit major moments [重要时刻] in history and in a conversational tone [对话的形式], dispel /dɪ'spɛl/ [vt.驱散,赶跑] misinformation surrounding those figures and events. Each episode alternates between who does the research and who plays the layperson peppering the other host with questions. 

# II.the streaming media wars:a win for consumers
# 1.More Content Than Ever Before
> Over-the-top (OTT) streaming [OTT传输] and all those binge-watching sessions are only possible because of advancements in the transcoding /træns'kəud/ [内容转码], delivery and playback of content [回放]. Consumers are generally no longer forced to pay sky-high [高昂] cable prices [有线电视费用] for preset programming schedules. Ultimately, people can now choose the types of services that are right for them [适合自己] and prioritize [优先选择] the content they care about based on their budget.

# 2.More Ad-Free And Ad-Supported Options 
> There is more brilliant original ad-free programming [更多精彩的原创无广告节目] than ever before, as each content house works to produce quality entertainment [高质量娱乐节目], giving us all something to get excited about.

> This is great for consumers, but ad-supported content [广告支持内容] is a win for content providers [内容提供商] and advertisers as well, enabling them to better target consumers with relevant ads [投放相关广告] provided by measurable access to demographic criteria [定量统计的人口指标].

# 3.The Experience Is Getting Better, Too
> Even hardware makers [硬件制造商] are playing a role in improving the consumer entertainment experience, with companies like Roku, NVIDIA, Apple, Amazon and more working to bring consumers an elegant new media experience through living room devices [客厅设备] that make accessing each service easier. 

> While other advancements like data aggregation [数据聚合] or transcoding [转码] and delivery [传输] are behind the scenes [隐藏于幕后], it's this type of technology innovation that continues to make the overall streaming experience shine [更加出众] in the living room.

# III.grammar
# 1.compound adjectives [复合形容词]
> these adjectives were formed by combining a noun with a participle adjective [分词形容词]. Participle adjectives typically end in -en, -ed, or -ing.[分词形容词通常以“-en”，“-ed”或“-ing”结尾]

- We need to look beyond our ad-driven model to find other ways to monetize our products. [我们要超越广告驱动模式，找到其他方法使我们的产品获利]

# 2.Appositives clauses [同位语从句]
> 1)Appositives  are often nouns or noun phrases, and they usually follow another noun or noun phrase to provide bonus information

> 2)Today we're talking about adding entire clauses, like we see in the phrase "the fact that more and more consumers are opting out of their cable subscriptions for streaming services is causing the film industry to restructure."

> 3)Nouns like fact, idea, belief, thought, knowledge, and a few others are often followed by appositive clauses. In most cases, appositive clauses are introduced by "that."

# 3.market
## 1)subscribe /səbˈskraɪb/ 订阅 & subscriptions /səbˈskrɪpʃənz/ 订阅
> 1)

> 2)So if you are like a member of something, you pretty much have a subscription. Except for things like, if you go to the gym, you wouldn't say you have a gym subscription.It is usually for media or content that you can consume, not necessarily a place that you go.In that case, you probably just be a member. But here, more and more people are going for the streaming services subscriptions and "is causing the film industry to restructure."

> 

## 3)monetization /ˌmʌnətaɪˈzeɪʃən/ [赚钱方法]

## 10)cable subscriptions
> A cable subscription would come to your TV through a cable, a physical thing, which is also called a cord. 

## 11）cord-cutting [断线（引申为观众不再看有线电视）]
> But cord-cutting, that started at least ten or twenty years ago when people just got tired of these really expensive cable packages.So they started cutting the cord, meaning they were getting rid of their cable subscriptions. And then this's led to like I said some "drastic shifts" in the market.

> 1)so "to restructure" basically means to change.like change the nature of something, the shape.So this is not just some small change. We can say . It's a fundamental change.it's a really big change basically. You can think about it like this, for years and years and years, people have been watching TV through their cable subscriptions, but now the whole game is changing. It is "restructuring" because of the streaming services.

> 2)One more thing about "restructuring." They love to use this word at work. If the company is restructuring, it basically means that a bunch of people are getting fired.


# IV.pattern
***It seems like there's a podcast for everything these days from journalism to amateur reviews.***

***Tell me about it. The lists are exhaustive. When it started in the early 2000s, it was super geeky and esoteric.***

***Yeah, now it's gone really mainstream. So what spurred the explosion?***

***Well, in 2014, podcasts gained traction, appealing to listeners with suspense and storytelling.***

***Wasn't that when "Serial" emerged and spawned a plethora of similar podcasts? It was really intimate and gripping.***

***Yeah! Being able to subscribe to podcasts makes it more personalized and engaging too.***

***True, and that engagement drives the monetization.***

***Speaking of which, China has a really interesting, alternative model.***

***It's more of a "pay-for-knowledge" model than an ad-driven model, right?***

***Yeah, people actually pay for content since a lot of it is skill-based.***

***Hmm… maybe we could start our own podcast and cash in?***

***Haha! Well I'm not sure if that'll work here, but it can't hurt to try.***

# IV.pattern
***I swear, every day there's a new streaming service coming out.***

***It's true. But companies like Netflix and Hulu have been around for ages. It's funny that everyone else is just hopping on the bandwagon now.***

***Yeah, well the fact that more and more consumers are opting out of their cable subscriptions for streaming services is causing the film industry to restructure.***

***That must be why Disney+ and Apple TV+ came out not too long ago. I bet traditional broadcasting and TV advertising have suffered a huge blow too.***

***Sure have. Cord-cutting has led to drastic shifts in the market, which is why telecom giants AT&T and Comcast will be coming out with their own streaming services this year too.***

***Sounds like they're trying to get a piece of the pie as well. I'm just not sure how much more room there is for market penetration.***

***I agree. I mean who has the time to watch all these new shows, let alone pay for all these different services?***

***You'd be surprised. Besides, that's how these companies get you: they hook you in by offering original series that are exclusive to their streaming service.***

***That reminds me. I need to renew my Amazon Video account.***
