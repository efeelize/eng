***It seems like there's a podcast for everything these days from journalism to amateur reviews.***

***Tell me about it. The lists are exhaustive. When it started in the early 2000s, it was super geeky and esoteric.***

***Yeah, now it's gone really mainstream. So what spurred the explosion?***

***Well, in 2014, podcasts gained traction, appealing to listeners with suspense and storytelling.***

***Wasn't that when "Serial" emerged and spawned a plethora of similar podcasts? It was really intimate and gripping.***

***Yeah! Being able to subscribe to podcasts makes it more personalized and engaging too.***

***True, and that engagement drives the monetization.***

***Speaking of which, China has a really interesting, alternative model.***

***It's more of a "pay-for-knowledge" model than an ad-driven model, right?***

***Yeah, people actually pay for content since a lot of it is skill-based.***

***Hmmâ€¦ maybe we could start our own podcast and cash in?***

***Haha! Well I'm not sure if that'll work here, but it can't hurt to try.***

***I swear, every day there's a new streaming service coming out.***

***It's true. But companies like Netflix and Hulu have been around for ages. It's funny that everyone else is just hopping on the bandwagon now.***

***Yeah, well the fact that more and more consumers are opting out of their cable subscriptions for streaming services is causing the film industry to restructure.***

***That must be why Disney+ and Apple TV+ came out not too long ago. I bet traditional broadcasting and TV advertising have suffered a huge blow too.***

***Sure have. Cord-cutting has led to drastic shifts in the market, which is why telecom giants AT&T and Comcast will be coming out with their own streaming services this year too.***

***Sounds like they're trying to get a piece of the pie as well. I'm just not sure how much more room there is for market penetration.***

***I agree. I mean who has the time to watch all these new shows, let alone pay for all these different services?***

***You'd be surprised. Besides, that's how these companies get you: they hook you in by offering original series that are exclusive to their streaming service.***

***That reminds me. I need to renew my Amazon Video account.***
