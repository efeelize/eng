# Streaming_service & podcast

# I.the best podcasts to listen to right now.
# 1.News & Politics
> Opinion columnists [专栏作家] David Leonhardt, Michelle Goldberg and Ross Douthat debate every week on a different, timely topic [当下话题]. Though some stances /stɑ:ns/ [观点] will surely infuriate /ɪn'fjʊrɪet/ [激怒] listeners, everyone will learn how the other side thinks.

# 2.Interview

# 3.Culture

# II.the streaming media wars:a win for consumers
# 1.More Content Than Ever Before
> Over-the-top (OTT) streaming [OTT传输] and all those binge-watching sessions are only possible because of advancements in the transcoding /træns'kəud/ [内容转码], delivery and playback of content [回放]. Consumers are generally no longer forced to pay sky-high [高昂] cable prices [有线电视费用] for preset programming schedules. Ultimately, people can now choose the types of services that are right for them [适合自己] and prioritize [优先选择] the content they care about based on their budget.

# 2.More Ad-Free And Ad-Supported Options 
> There is more brilliant original ad-free programming [更多精彩的原创无广告节目] than ever before, as each content house works to produce quality entertainment [高质量娱乐节目], giving us all something to get excited about.

> This is great for consumers, but ad-supported content [广告支持内容] is a win for content providers [内容提供商] and advertisers as well, enabling them to better target consumers with relevant ads [投放相关广告] provided by measurable access to demographic criteria [定量统计的人口指标].

# 3.The Experience Is Getting Better, Too
> Even hardware makers [硬件制造商] are playing a role in improving the consumer entertainment experience, with companies like Roku, NVIDIA, Apple, Amazon and more working to bring consumers an elegant new media experience through living room devices [客厅设备] that make accessing each service easier. 

> While other advancements like data aggregation [数据聚合] or transcoding [转码] and delivery [传输] are behind the scenes [隐藏于幕后], it's this type of technology innovation that continues to make the overall streaming experience shine [更加出众] in the living room.

# III.grammar
# 1.compound adjectives [复合形容词]

***It seems like there's a podcast for everything these days from journalism to amateur reviews.***

***Tell me about it. The lists are exhaustive. When it started in the early 2000s, it was super geeky and esoteric.***

***Yeah, now it's gone really mainstream. So what spurred the explosion?***

***Well, in 2014, podcasts gained traction, appealing to listeners with suspense and storytelling.***

***Wasn't that when "Serial" emerged and spawned a plethora of similar podcasts? It was really intimate and gripping.***

***Yeah! Being able to subscribe to podcasts makes it more personalized and engaging too.***

***True, and that engagement drives the monetization.***

***Speaking of which, China has a really interesting, alternative model.***

***It's more of a "pay-for-knowledge" model than an ad-driven model, right?***

***Yeah, people actually pay for content since a lot of it is skill-based.***

***Hmm… maybe we could start our own podcast and cash in?***

***Haha! Well I'm not sure if that'll work here, but it can't hurt to try.***

# IV.pattern
***I swear, every day there's a new streaming service coming out.***

***It's true. But companies like Netflix and Hulu have been around for ages. It's funny that everyone else is just hopping on the bandwagon now.***

***Yeah, well the fact that more and more consumers are opting out of their cable subscriptions for streaming services is causing the film industry to restructure.***

***That must be why Disney+ and Apple TV+ came out not too long ago. I bet traditional broadcasting and TV advertising have suffered a huge blow too.***

***Sure have. Cord-cutting has led to drastic shifts in the market, which is why telecom giants AT&T and Comcast will be coming out with their own streaming services this year too.***

***Sounds like they're trying to get a piece of the pie as well. I'm just not sure how much more room there is for market penetration.***

***I agree. I mean who has the time to watch all these new shows, let alone pay for all these different services?***

***You'd be surprised. Besides, that's how these companies get you: they hook you in by offering original series that are exclusive to their streaming service.***

***That reminds me. I need to renew my Amazon Video account.***
