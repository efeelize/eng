# I.three things we learned about Barack Obama from his new book,A Promised Land
# 1.the book is about more than just politics
> Obama stresses that his aim is to offer a genuine insight into his life – "not just a historical record of key events", explaining: "I wanted to offer readers a sense of what it's like to be the president of the United States; I wanted to remind people that, the presidency is still just a job and our federal government is a human enterprise like any other, and the men and women who work in the White House experience the same daily mix of satisfaction,disappointment,and office friction."

# 2.He hasn't always been a smooth talker
> Although known for his inspiring and charismatic speeches, their potent messages tempered with a note of humor and unstuffy charm, Obama admits that he hasn't always been such a master of words.

# 3.Michelle took some time to get on board with his political ambitions
> Michelle Obama is a passionate supporter of her husband and an accomplished attorney and author in her own right. Yet Obama relates that his wife refused to campaign with him for his US Senate race. It wasn't long, however, before she was won over, becoming a familiar face on the campaign trail.

# II.grammar
# 1.- st/amongst,admidst,whilst
> The word "amongst" can express that an object, person or idea is included in a larger group of similar things.For instance, in today's dialogue, the speaker says, "Amongst the highlights are his revelations on the Affordable Care Act and his struggles to transcend bipartisan politics." In other words, his "revelations" are one of the many highlights that are included in this book.

> However, we could also say "among" instead. Adding the "-st" makes the word more formal (and perhaps a little older sounding); however, there is no difference in meaning between "among" and "amongst." We see the same effect in “amid” and "amidst" and "while" and "whilst."
