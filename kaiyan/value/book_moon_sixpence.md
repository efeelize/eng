# I.the moon and sixpence
> The novel The Moon and Sixpence by W. Somerset Maugham, was published in 1919. It is based loosely on the life of artist Paul Gauguin, who became famous for his paintings in the “primitive” style.

> The story is told through first-person narration in an episodic structure that follows the protagonist, Charles Strickland. The narrator is a character named Crabbe, who knew Strickland for a few years before he left his family and his job as a stockbroker in England to pursue his artistic interests. The story comprises Crabbe's memories of Strickland, as well as those shared with him by people throughout Tahiti who knew Charles.

> An important theme driving this novel is the idea of the simple life versus prestige and respectability. Strickland eschews his lifestyle living and working in London and raising children with his wife, for poverty in France and ultimately a "primitive" lifestyle in Tahiti. He is far happier in Tahiti than he ever was in London, because he is exploring his passion—painting.

> Strickland is not the only character in The Moon and Sixpence who gives up his life to pursue a new, simpler one. This decision brings up another theme, which is the idea of giving up everything in one's life for a cause.

# II.grammar
# 1.using past participial [n.过去分词] phrases to modify the noun
> In today's monologue, the speaker used the past participial phrase "consumed by passion" to modify the subject of the sentence "he." Participial phrases are common in novels, newspapers, academic writing and speeches. They allow the speaker/writer to add information about the subject without making the sentence
too long, which can help readability and give it more impact.

> For instance, the speaker could have said, "He becomes consumed by passion and abandons his wife and embarks on a quest to fulfill his artistic vision." However, the repetition of "and" makes this sentence overly long and boring. But the speaker shortens the sentence with the participial phrase like this:"Consumed by passion, he..." This gives the sentence more impact while keeping it easy to read.

> As you may have guessed, we often use past participial phrases to give reasons for someone's actions. For instance, "Angered by the events, he refused to participate."
