# knowledge_payment

# I.knowledge payment in China
> Getting Chinese to pay for online content used to be a fantasy, but things are fast changing.A revolution called zhi shi fu fei is well under way. This term, knowledge payment, just means that people are willing to pay to access content to acquire knowledge instead of getting it for free.

> Unlike in the US where content-makers primarily rely on advertising, many Chinese companies and individuals have managed to monetize content by making users directly pay for it.

> Paying for online content goes way beyond education. Video livestreaming is also huge. People can watch for free but show their love and support to the hosts by sending them virtual gifts or tokens. The live- streamers can then exchange them for cash.

> China pioneered the free-to-play model with video gaming. Widespread adoption of mobile payments also makes paying for knowledge fast and seamless.

> For years, China was known mostly for copy catting U.S. innovations. Now, the tables have turned. There is a lot that American companies can learn from their Chinese counterparts in order to develop content that Americans would be willing to pay for.
