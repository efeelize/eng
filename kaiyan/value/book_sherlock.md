> 1. There was no 221B Baker Street when Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about Sherlock Holmes. The numbering of Baker Street only ran up to 85 at the time.

> 2. The phrase "Elementary, my dear Watson" is a myth, and is never uttered in any of Doyle's stories about the detective. The closest we get is "Exactly, my dear Watson," which Sherlocks says in three different tales.

> 3. After six years of writing the wildly popular Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle was bored with the character and decided to kill him off in the novel "The Final Problem." In this story Sherlock encounters his arch-nemesis Moriarty and they both plunge to their deaths at the Swiss Reichenbach Falls. Doyle's readers were very upset about this, and he was flooded by letters from angry Sherlockians.

> Eight years later he had an idea for a story that demanded a detective character, and instead of inventing a new one – he decided to bring back Sherlock Holmes and place the setting of the story before Sherlock's death. This novel is the very famous “The Hound of the Baskervilles."

> 4. It's a common misconception that Sherlock Holmes was an actual live person. Even in Arthur Conan Doyle's day, he received plenty of letters from people who wished to hire the genius detective to solve their cases.

# II.grammar
# 1.none other than
> 1）We use this phrase "none other than" to show that we are surprised, excited, or impressed by the person or thing we are about to mention.

> 2）Not surprisingly, we use this phrase a lot before mentioning famous people. But we will also encounter it a lot in mystery novels, like those in which Holmes would appear. It's a phrase that a detective would use before revealing the identity of a murderer or thief at the end of the story.

# III.pattern
***Have you ever wondered who the most portrayed literary human character in film and television history is?***

***This literary legend is none other than Sherlock Holmes, creation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.***

***The dispassionate detective, along with his faithful assistant Watson, has appeared in four novels and 56 short stories, and countless other adaptations.***

***Although he was killed off by Doyle in 1893, insatiable public demand brought the eccentric Holmes back to life years later.***

***Interestingly, although he is best known for the quote "elementary, my dear Watson," this was never actually uttered by Holmes.***

***Here are some phrases that were:***

***"It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories,instead of theories to suit facts."***

***"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact."***

***"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."***
