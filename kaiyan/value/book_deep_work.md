# I.5 deep work practice that'll change your life
# 1. distance yourself from social media
> Cull the Twitters, Instagrams, Facebooks of your social media life by ruthlessly discarding any site that doesn't inherently contribute to a quality life.

# 2.give yourself a strict period of time to spend working 
> The more you give yourself limits, the less time you have for wool-gathering as you dither between a newsletter, your Facebook feed, and The New York Times.

# 3.use repetitive tasks to work out concepts 
> Instead of zoning out to your favorite podcast, flicking through the radio, or zoning out to your third viewing of Game of Thrones, you can train your mind to use trapped time to work on the knotty sections of your deep work.

# 4.actions speak louder than words
> This includes: Focus on the wildly important, act on lead measures, and create a cadence of accountability.

# 5.aviod shallow work 
> Checking email, filling in a spreadsheet, tweaking the monthly slide update — these are all examples of shallow work.

# II.grammar

# III.pattern
***Ever feel like your hard work isn't producing real results?***

***In his bestselling book Deep Work, computer science professor Cal Newport argues that you may need to make a shift from hard work to deep work.***

***He characterizes deep work as "distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to the limit." In psychology, it's called a flow state. Informally, it's simply being "in the zone."***

***Its opposite, "shallow work," consists of busywork that is cognitively "shallow" and produces very little value compared to deep work.***

***Applying deep work to your work ethic is anything but easy. It requires a rigorous training regimen, like removing distractions and scheduling time methodically.***

***He gives suggestions like switching off your internet, committing to a fixed end time of your day, and reorienting your focus using brain-building exercises.***

***Newport promises that cultivating deep work habits will have a transformative effect on your productivity and increase satisfaction in our lives.***
