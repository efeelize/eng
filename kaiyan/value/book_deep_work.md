***Ever feel like your hard work isn't producing real results?***

***In his bestselling book Deep Work, computer science professor Cal Newport argues that you may need to make a shift from hard work to deep work.***

***He characterizes deep work as "distraction-free concentration that pushes your cognitive capabilities to the limit." In psychology, it's called a flow state. Informally, it's simply being "in the zone."***

***Its opposite, "shallow work," consists of busywork that is cognitively "shallow" and produces very little value compared to deep work.***

***Applying deep work to your work ethic is anything but easy. It requires a rigorous training regimen, like removing distractions and scheduling time methodically.***

***He gives suggestions like switching off your internet, committing to a fixed end time of your day, and reorienting your focus using brain-building exercises.***

***Newport promises that cultivating deep work habits will have a transformative effect on your productivity and increase satisfaction in our lives.***
