# 4.Gather feedback

In fact, the self-imposed deadline will help you accomplish more.Whether you’re starting a business or writing a dissertation /'dɪsɚ'teʃən/ [n.专题论文,学位论文], it’s important to establish interim /'ɪntərɪm/ [adj.临时的] goals.

# 3. Avoid the curse of the “final push.[临时抱佛脚]”

# III.Make Your Own Deadlines to Make Your Own Success

Imposing deadlines on yourself can help make the final deadline seem less intimidating. In doing this, it can also reduce stress and help you enjoy your work. Humans naturally don't prepare for the future very well, so in a modern world full of responsibilities and expectations, we need extra help. Here are a few more tips that might help you follow through with your self-imposed deadlines:

> Make your self-imposed deadlines external[公布自己设定的最后期限]. Ask your friend, colleague, mom, or even your boss to be your accountability partner. Let them know about your deadline so they can encourage and remind you. 

> Set incremental /ɪnkrə'məntl/ [adj.增加的] deadlines for smaller milestones. Instead of saying, "I want to write a dissertation by next year," make a smaller win for yourself: "I want to write the introduction of my dissertation by next month."

***Hey, Martin. You look really good. Have you been working out?***

***Actually, yeah, and dieting too. It's been about six months now.***

***That's impressive! I tried but it's so hard to stick to a new habit.***

***For me, the key is not to jump in too quickly, otherwise you'll burn out.***

***That's what happened to me. Then I beat myself up when I didn't do enough.***

***That happens to the best of us. But if you reward yourself even for small victories, it's certain to be more effective.***

***Makes sense. I guess that applies to any new habit.***

***Totally, even learning a new language. It also helps to have a well-thought-out plan, like writing a schedule.***

***What about when I just get lazy and lose motivation?***

***Then you need support from your friends, like me!***

# V.pattern
***Mackenzie, I've been in such a slump lately. Got any advice on how I could better myself?***

***I've got tons. First things first: step out of your comfort zone.***

***Ok, but how should I do that?***

***Be real with yourself. Face your fears and flaws. It's the first step to self-improvement.***

***Ok, sounds like I should challenge myself and be more self-aware. What else?***

***Try surrounding yourself with more positive people who are always trying to improve themselves.***

***Funny you say that. I recently stopped hanging out with people who I thought were negative.***

***Good move. Negativity will just drag you down.***

***What about setting specific goals? ***

***Absolutely. That helps a lot. But make sure you set realistic goals, and make working toward them part of your daily routine.***

***Yes. Why do you ask?***

***Well, I've recently read a lot about the importance of finding a career mentor. I’m feeling a bit stagnant at work and could really use some advice. But I don't know how mentoring works or how to even find one.***

***Well the first thing you need to keep in mind is that mentoring is a two-way relationship[双向关系]. Your mentor also has to be getting something out of it[你的导师也要从中有所收获]. Although, it is flattering to have your opinion valued[能被你看重作为导师是很受宠若惊], not everyone has the time to give an hour of free advice.***

***Most people, especially someone you’d consider a mentor, are swamped with various projects or assignments[要事缠身]; and taking on a mentee can be more of a burden than a reward. You may get turned down[失望], but that doesn’t mean you should give up; some people just have very limited time.***

***I’d love to run a company someday, so do you think it would be a good idea to ask the CEO?***

***Don’t think that you can just go into the CEO’s office and ask him or her to be your mentor. You should be a little more acquainted with the person.[你应该和对方相互再熟一点]***

***So whom should I ask?***

***Ask a manager, director[总监] or someone in a senior position at your company. I advise thinking of a few reasons why he or she is someone you look up to. You can say something like, “You have a real aptitude for problem solving.[你有很高的解决问题的资质]”***

***What if I am interested in someone who doesn’t work with me? How could I approach them?***

***Well, you could cold call your potential mentor. This could really impress your mentor, since it’ll show that you’re somewhat audacious[因为你的大胆对你印象深刻]. Having the guts to bravely cold call a person you admire is definitely an entrepreneurial skill[有胆量直接打电话给陌生人绝对是个企业家才有的技能]. Making an appearance in person [亲自拜访] can also impress your mentor.***

***Remember to be amiable [温和亲善] in these situations. Even if your potential mentor says no, they may decide to contact you later—like when they’re less busy. Remember you need to look for someone of high caliber, who is a plausible candidate and has experience in the things you want to do.***

***Thanks a bunch for the advice![金玉良言]***
