# I.the joy of delusion
> In an important sense, "Stumbling on Happiness" is a paean to delusion. "How do we manage to think of ourselves as great drivers, talented lovers and brilliant chefs when the facts of our lives include a pathetic parade of dented cars, disappointed partners and deflated soufflés?" Gilbert asks. "The answer is simple: We cook the facts."

> Gilbert's argument is the cognitive scientist's version of Freudian delusion, with faulty logic causing us to misperceive reality, and make decisions that are not in our rational, happiness-maximizing interest. What gets us through life, evidently, is just the right amount of delusion — enough to fool us into feeling relatively good about ourselves, but not so much as to exceed our own credulity.

> Can awareness of these cognitive mechanisms make us happier, or at least less deluded? Alas, not really. In fact, that's sort of Gilbert's point: imagination ought to be the key to predicting what will make us happy, but we're incapable of imagining accurately.

> Interestingly, the clinically depressed seem less susceptible to these basic cognitive errors. For instance, healthy people can be deluded into greater happiness when granted the mere illusion of control over their environment; the clinically depressed recognize the illusion for what it is. All in all, it's yet more evidence that unhappy people have the more accurate view of reality — and that learning how to kid ourselves may be a key to mental health.

> "When in truth" is a dramatic phrase that is used to reveal a truth or an opposing opinion. For instance, "She said that she was happy, when in truth she was not happy at all."

It can also be removed so that “in truth” starts the next sentence, e.g., "In truth, Gilbert argues, this is a false belief that does more to protect the economy."

***Stumbling on Happiness is a funny and insightful exploration into why we're such poor predictors of our own happiness.***

***In this award-winning book, social psychologist Daniel Gilbert examines the nature of happiness and explains why the keys to our contentment continue to elude us.***

***To Gilbert, the answer is society and our fundamentally flawed ability to imagine.***

***On one hand, society has ingrained that factors such as wealth can lead to happiness, when in truth,Gilbert argues, this is a false belief that does more to protect the economy.***

***Our brains also constantly fall victim to a wide range of biases and mental tricks.***

***For one, we think our projections of our future desires are more accurate than they are and often fail to see how present emotions can skew them.***

***Unfortunately, we tend to overestimate negative experiences, which can lead us to shy away from difficult situations that might give us more pleasure than we may imagine.***

***Thus, Gilbert urges us to be bold and says that we would do well to base our predictions on the experiences of others rather than our projections alone.***
