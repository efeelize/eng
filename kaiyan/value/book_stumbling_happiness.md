# 1.[False idea/common opinion] + when in truth + [truth/opposing opinion].
> "When in truth" is a dramatic phrase that is used to reveal a truth or an opposing opinion. For instance, "She said that she was happy, when in truth she was not happy at all."

> Here, Gilbert is arguing that society has created this false belief that wealth can lead to happiness in order to motivate those in society to make money and propel the economy.Note that the conjunction "when" can be substituted with "but" in this phrase. It can also be removed so that “in truth” starts the next sentence, e.g., "In truth, Gilbert argues, this is a false belief that does more to protect the economy."

# III.pattern
***Stumbling on Happiness is a funny and insightful exploration into why we're such poor predictors of our own happiness.***

***In this award-winning book, social psychologist Daniel Gilbert examines the nature of happiness and explains why the keys to our contentment continue to elude us.***

***To Gilbert, the answer is society and our fundamentally flawed ability to imagine.***

***On one hand, society has ingrained that factors such as wealth can lead to happiness, when in truth,Gilbert argues, this is a false belief that does more to protect the economy.***

***Our brains also constantly fall victim to a wide range of biases and mental tricks.***

***For one, we think our projections of our future desires are more accurate than they are and often fail to see how present emotions can skew them.***

***Unfortunately, we tend to overestimate negative experiences, which can lead us to shy away from difficult situations that might give us more pleasure than we may imagine.***

***Thus, Gilbert urges us to be bold and says that we would do well to base our predictions on the experiences of others rather than our projections alone.***
