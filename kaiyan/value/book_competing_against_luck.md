# I.How to execute job-to-be done theory
> Jobs-to-be-Done innovation theory is the subject of the book Competing Against Luck. The central idea behind the theory is: "Your customers are not buying your products, they are hiring them to get a job done," which will be demonstrated here with concrete measures.

# 1.define your customer's jobs
> Define a job as the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance with three dimensions: functional, social and emotional dimensions.

# 2.identify all the needs in customer's job
> Customer needs contain a direction, a metric and a goal, which offers more detail about what "quickly and efficiently" means to the job executors.

# 3.find the unmet needs in your customer's job
> Finding unmet needs is how you precisely articulate and quantify your customers' struggles.

# 4.segment your customers
> With Jobs-to-be-Done, the target is the job executors with the most unmet needs. They are the most underserved customers and therefore the segment who is most likely to buy ("hire") your product to get the job done.

# 5.generate ideas and plan roadmap
> To build on the ideas or to choose which product features to build now and which to postpone, priority needs should be calculated and considered.

# II.grammar
# 1.he contends
> A parenthetical phrase is an explanatory phrase that is separated by commas. And, as a result, it can be removed from a sentence without changing the meaning. For instance, "The project, I assume, will be
completed shortly." Here "the project" is the subject, and "I assume" is a parenthetical phrase that can be removed.

> Likewise, in today's lesson, the speaker said, "But in truth, he contends, gaining traction has more to do with reframing our approach to innovation." Here, the parenthetical phrase "he contends" adds a dramatic touch,making the sentence more impactful to listeners.

# III.pattern
***Two decades ago, Clayton Christensen revolutionized business with his theory of disruptive innovation.***

***Now he's back with more insights on predictive growth in his best-selling book Competing against Luck.***

***All too often, companies think luck ultimately determines whether a product sinks or floats.***

***But in truth, he contends, gaining traction has more to do with reframing our approach to innovation.***

***His theory is that consumers hire a product to fulfill a job, and by pinpointing those jobs, we can understand the causal mechanisms behind customer behavior — the true driver of innovation.***

***He recommends 3 easy steps to help us harness this knowledge and transform our success:***

***1. Find a job that needs to be done. Dig deep and pinpoint the functional and emotional reasons behind hiring a product.2. Document the journey. Analyze the situation and experience of the purchase to hone in on the friction.3. Remove the obstacles and remedy the frustration. New innovations have to be "twice as good" to convince customers to switch.***
