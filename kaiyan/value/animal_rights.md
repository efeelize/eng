***Hey Dean, what made you decide to go vegan?***

***I hated knowing that I was adding to the systematic suffering and exploitation of animals.***

***Factory farming is one thing, but what about the meat that has been prepared in a humane way?***

***There's nothing humane about slaughtering animals; no matter how it's done, Oliver.***

***OK, I take it you believe animals still lack legal protection. So what are your thoughts about the Animal Welfare Act?***

***It's merely a set of loose guidelines concocted by speciesist lawmakers. It fails to truly protect defenseless animals. Furthermore, it only applies to the US.***

***Wow, you sound like a hardcore animal rights activist. Animal rights are indeed a global matter, but you have to start somewhere. Right?***

***Honestly, America is lagging behind in this sphere. Currently, 32 other countries worldwide formally recognize non-human animal sentience.***

***Come again?***

***Basically, animal consciousness. Though defining consciousness remains elusive, it's clear that animals have the capacity for suffering like you and I.***

***I agree with you there. My dog is definitely capable of a wide range of emotions.***

***Yeah, therefore they shouldn't be treated unjustly. And so the fight for anti-cruelty laws rages on.***
