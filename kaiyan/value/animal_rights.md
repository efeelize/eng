# 2.animal
## 1）factory farming [n.工厂化养殖]
> so factory farming, this is a term that we use for just like massive production of animal, like basically, meat, meat products, or even dairy too, really. So like milk that comes from cows.It's basically just like a ton of animals all stuffed into one big warehouse where they're all just like bred to be killed, and they have really bad living conditions,They're living very closely together. They're often living in their own waste, and because of this, sometimes disease can spread quickly. Um, but a lot of companies like this because it's cheaper for the companies. They can produce a lot of meat with very little space.

## 4）anti-cruelty [n.反虐待动物]

## 1）humane [adj.人道的，仁慈的] & humanity 
> 1)humane means you treated them with kindness and care.we have an agency where you can adopt animals, and it's called the Humane Society.

## 2）speciesist /ˈspiːʃiːzɪst/ [n.物种歧视者]
> if you're a speciesist, it basically means that you think humans are always superior to animals, and all animals of that. So basically if you're a speciesist lawmaker and you're coming up with animal rights laws, you're never really gonna be able to give them the protection that they need because you don't think much of animals in the first place.

## 3）activist /ˈæktəvɪst/ [n.激进分子]
>  an "activist" is a person who really strongly believes in change, usually, political change. This person really wants to do something to change the laws.So we have all kinds of activists out there, so here we're talking about animal rights activists,there's environmental activists, right, environmental protection activists.

## 4）hardcore /ˈhɑːrdˌkɔːr/ [adj.硬核的]

# III.pattern
***Hey Dean, what made you decide to go vegan?***

***I hated knowing that I was adding to the systematic suffering and exploitation of animals.***

***Factory farming is one thing, but what about the meat that has been prepared in a humane way?***

***There's nothing humane about slaughtering animals; no matter how it's done, Oliver.***

***OK, I take it you believe animals still lack legal protection. So what are your thoughts about the Animal Welfare Act?***

***It's merely a set of loose guidelines concocted by speciesist lawmakers. It fails to truly protect defenseless animals. Furthermore, it only applies to the US.***

***Wow, you sound like a hardcore animal rights activist. Animal rights are indeed a global matter, but you have to start somewhere. Right?***

***Honestly, America is lagging behind in this sphere. Currently, 32 other countries worldwide formally recognize non-human animal sentience.***

***Come again?***

***Basically, animal consciousness. Though defining consciousness remains elusive, it's clear that animals have the capacity for suffering like you and I.***

***I agree with you there. My dog is definitely capable of a wide range of emotions.***

***Yeah, therefore they shouldn't be treated unjustly. And so the fight for anti-cruelty laws rages on.***
