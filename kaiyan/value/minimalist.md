# I.Hacks for simplifying life [化生活小妙招]
> These days, it's almost a badge of honor [值得炫耀] to find ways to balance the chaos of our fast-paced lives. If you've been feeling weighed down [心力交瘁], consider looking for things you can remove from your life. 

# 1.Get rid of unnecessary stuff
> Most of us have much more than we actually need. Set aside some time for a decluttering [清理] session. Consider donating items [捐赠一些物品] and think about the fact that someone out there might be very grateful for something you no longer need. 

# 2.Unplug [远离] from technology
> We are so tethered to [依赖] our devices. It's hard to believe that none of these even existed a few years ago. While it's probably not realistic to go off the grid entirely [完全不上网可能不太现实], we can make a conscious effort [有意识地] to unplug from technology [远离科技] when it's not needed (especially at bedtime!). 

# 3.Downsize in every way [全方面精简]
> Downsizing can really simplify your life so that you can focus your attention on what really matters. In addition to shedding possessions [舍弃不再适用的财产] and ending relationships that no longer serve you, it may also be helpful to reduce your number of commitments [精简手头的事情].

# II.grammar
# 1.been there/done that 
> The phrase "been there, (done that)" is the shortened version of "I've been there and done that." It's used to empathize with other people's experiences and to say that you've experienced something before and would rather not repeat it. This could be for a number of reasons, including because you find the experience boring or unpleasant, or simply want to try something new.

- 1. A: I locked myself out of my car yesterday. B: Yeah, been there! I had to wait an hour for my wife to come with her key!

- 2. A: Why don't you go to Rome for vacation? B: Nah! Been there, done that!

- 3. A: You could go on a cruise. B: Mmm, been there, done that. I want to do something new.
