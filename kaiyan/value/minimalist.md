# I.Hacks for simplifying life [化生活小妙招]
> These days, it's almost a badge of honor [值得炫耀] to find ways to balance the chaos of our fast-paced lives. If you've been feeling weighed down [心力交瘁], consider looking for things you can remove from your life. 

# 1.Get rid of unnecessary stuff
> Most of us have much more than we actually need. Set aside some time for a decluttering [清理] session. Consider donating items [捐赠一些物品] and think about the fact that someone out there might be very grateful for something you no longer need. 

# 2.Unplug [远离] from technology
> We are so tethered to [依赖] our devices. It's hard to believe that none of these even existed a few years ago. While it's probably not realistic to go off the grid entirely [完全不上网可能不太现实], we can make a conscious effort [有意识地] to unplug from technology [远离科技] when it's not needed (especially at bedtime!). 

# 3.Downsize in every way [全方面精简]
> Downsizing can really simplify your life so that you can focus your attention on what really matters. In addition to shedding possessions [舍弃不再适用的财产] and ending relationships that no longer serve you, it may also be helpful to reduce your number of commitments [精简手头的事情].
