# I.kidults and the market
> Kidult” or kidult generation is a marketing neologism created to describe a new and growing market. There is an increasing number of products and services targeted to this segment.

> There have been many and different explanations for the kidult phenomenon. In any case, it is clear that the kidult generation is integrated by adults with purchasing power who, for some reason, show purchasing habits and interests that traditionally belonged to the children or teen segment.

> Kidults have a creative and playful spirit but that won’t keep them from adult responsibilities. Some common interests are technology in general, video games, cosplay, and fandom. Playing with video game consoles, reading comic books, watching superhero movies, collecting action figures, watching cartoons, or dressing as your favorite movie character are not for children anymore.

> The kidult market is not a niche anymore but a way to reach massivity by targeting a wide age range. Superheroes, fantasy, and sci-fi movies are currently watched with enthusiasm by children and adults. This transgenerational approach is one of the reasons for the success of franchises like “Harry Potter”, “Pirates of the Caribbean” and “The Lord of the Rings”.

***just got back from Shanghai Disney. Practically every other person I saw there was an adult!***

***Yes, the kidult culture is proliferating faster than anyone could have ever imagined.***

***I just don't get it. Where did all these celebrations of juvenile behavior come from?***

***Well, look at how dramatically the purchasing power of young people has gone up in recent years. They can afford to indulge more.***

***And marketers don't seem to have any qualms selling this dream of Peter Pan and Neverland.***

***Well sure, it's a massive market. But twenty and thirty somethings are more than willing to shell out to avoid having a mundane life.***

***Remember when adulthood was the goal, and youth was just a transitory stage to get there?***

***Absolutely, and with that came the tremendous social pressure to reach maturity.***

***Where's that pressure now? Society used to tell people to act their age, not their shoe size!***

***Come on, adulting is hard! I don't blame anyone for putting it off for as long as they can!***
