# I.Book summary:good to great by Jim Collins
> "Good is the enemy of Great." This is how the author sets off a riveting journey explaining the findings from his and his team's half a decade of research in the conquest of how to make good companies great. Essentially, "Good to Great" happens very rarely and it is because it is damn difficult. In his research, Jim Collins has found out systematic phases through which any great company goes through and lays out a framework as shown below. The framework has got three main components:

# 1.process
> From setting up yourselves towards greatness (aka Build Up) to achieving an inflection point that takes you to greatness (aka Breakthrough).

# 2.Phases
> There are three different phases in the "Good to Great" journey.Disciplined People: Involves getting the right leader and the right team.Disciplined Thought: Involves understanding of brutal facts and creating a set of core values.Disciplined Action: Creating a robust culture where the right people will work within the defined core values with the appropriate freedom

# 3.flywheel [飞轮效应]
> A quiet and deliberate process of figuring out what needs to be done for best future results and taking those steps one by one, pushing the flywheel in a consistent direction until it achieves a breakthrough point.

# II.grammar
# 1.participal phrase [n.分词短语]
> 1)In this lesson, the speaker uses the participial phrase “never giving up hope” to add information to the sentence. Participial phrases are frequently used as adjectives to modify the noun or pronoun in the main
clause. For example: The man, smiling and waving, said hello. “Smiling and waving” tells us about “the man.”

> 2)Participial phrases can use the present participle[现在分词]:Walking through the door, I bumped into my friend. (Meaning: When I walked through the door, I bumped into my friend.)

> 3)They can also use the past participle [过去分词]:Confused by the teacher, I raised my hand to ask a question. (Meaning: I was confused by the teacher, so I raised my hand to ask a question.)

> 4)Just remember, we must set off with participial phrases using a comma if they are not necessary for the meaning of the sentence.

# III.pattern
***What sets apart a good company or individual from a great one? In his book Good to Great, author Jim Collins used data from over 1,000 companies to answer that question. Year after year, the book has been heralded as one of the best business books on the market.***

***First, leaders must be humble and highly driven. They must have "ferocious resolve" and "intense professional will."***

***Collins also advises hiring the best people. He writes: "Expending energy trying to motivate people is largely a waste of time... If you have the right people, they will be self-motivated."***

***Money and resources do not equal success. He writes: "While you can buy your way to growth, you absolutely cannot buy your way to greatness."***

***He reminds readers that "greatness is not a function of circumstance. It is a matter of conscious choice and discipline." Confront the brutal facts, never giving up hope.***

***Most importantly, no company or individual can be great without discipline. "Good is the enemy of great.Few people attain great lives, in large part because it's just so easy to settle for a good life."***
