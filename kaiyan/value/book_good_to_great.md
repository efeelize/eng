***What sets apart a good company or individual from a great one? In his book Good to Great, author Jim Collins used data from over 1,000 companies to answer that question. Year after year, the book has been heralded as one of the best business books on the market.***

***First, leaders must be humble and highly driven. They must have "ferocious resolve" and "intense professional will."***

***Collins also advises hiring the best people. He writes: "Expending energy trying to motivate people is largely a waste of time... If you have the right people, they will be self-motivated."***

***Money and resources do not equal success. He writes: "While you can buy your way to growth, you absolutely cannot buy your way to greatness."***

***He reminds readers that "greatness is not a function of circumstance. It is a matter of conscious choice and discipline." Confront the brutal facts, never giving up hope.***

***Most importantly, no company or individual can be great without discipline. "Good is the enemy of great.Few people attain great lives, in large part because it's just so easy to settle for a good life."***
