***The guy was an absolute icon. As a five-time NBA champion, he dominated the court for 2 decades.***

***Yeah, he was the best shooting guard the Lakers ever had. Wasn't he drafted straight out of high school?***

***Yeah, Kobe was definitely a divisive figure, but his grit and passion for the game eventually won everyone over.***
