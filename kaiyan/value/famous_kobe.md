## 3)Mamba /ˈmæmbə/  mentality [n.曼巴精神]  & mentality /menˈtæləti/ [精神，心态] 
> 1)Mamba, this actually came from his nickname, Black Mamba.so he got this nickname Black Mamba from a movie actually, a character in a movie.this character was a killer, an assassin. Black mamba also is actually a snake, but he saw this character as a symbol for strength and kind of aggressiveness, and he wanted to become this character on the court, to be powerful.And strike down the enemy.

> 2)what the Mamba mentality became was this constant trying to be the best version of yourself. Like on the court, that might be someone who is aggressive and going for the ball, but it means different things off the court as well.

## 2)grit /grɪt/ [n.勇气，毅力] & gritty [adj.勇敢的]
> It means that you've got courage and determination to keep going, To persevere.And grit is just important for everything. Even for students, if you have grit, then you're more likely to keep going and keep learning and eventually get your goal.When I think of grit, I think of like the old cowboy western days. Those guys had grit. they're dirty. They're walking through the desert. They got the horses and they're tough and they persevere.but these days we often think of grit as being related to those CEOs.

> 2)The adjective form of grit is gritty.so you can be gritty.

## 3)revered /rɪˈvɪrd/ [ptcp.尊敬；崇敬] & to show reverence for sb 
> 1)revere is a lot stronger than respect. It's like respect like they are a god.And when you're "revered," you're respected and you're looked up to.so celebrities are revered. It kind of has this feeling like they're gods.we all know they're not. They're just people. They're just humans, and they worked really hard.

## 4)unrivaled /ʌnˈraɪvəld/ [adj.所向披靡的] & sb could rival sb 
> 1)so when you're unrivaled,it means that you have no competitors.so it's nice to be unrivaled in sports,but we can also say this word in other areas,too.

> 1) when we use it as an adjective. it's just sort of when you do a lot of damage to something.it means really really really sad and depressed.There's so much damage to my feelings.So you hear this a lot when we talk about death. "She was devastated by his death."

> 2)we can use it as a verb, too. So during war, a lot of cities are devastated.

## 7)Renaissance /ˈrenəsɑːns/ man  [n.多才多艺的人]
> 1)renaissance, first of all, was this period in the 1500s like when Da Vinci was alive. And we all know that Da Vinci could do so many different things.

> 2)So we have this term "renaissance man," and it just means someone who is very talented and someone who can do a lot of different things.

> 3)we usually say /ˈrenəsɑːns/, but some people say /rɪˈneɪsns/. It's a French word, but if you're in America, I would say /ˈrenəsɑːns/.
