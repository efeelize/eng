# I.preduictably irrational by Dan Ariely
## 1)the book in 3 sentences
- many of our behaviors are misguided.

- but they're not random;they're systematic and predictable.

- by recognizing our irrational patterns,we can make better decisions in life and business.

## 2)the five big ideas
- we tend to focus on what we may lose,rather than what we may gain.

- with everything you do,you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors.

- we assume other people will see monetary transactions from the same perspective as we do.

- people wiil work more for a cause than for cash.

- giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification is procrastination.

## 3)predictably irrational summary
- we tend to focus on the realtive advantage of one thing over another,and estimate value accordingly;

- once we buy a new product at a particular price,we become  anchored to that price.

- to improve an irrational behavior,ask yourself,"How did it begin?"second,ask yourself,"what amount of pleasure will I be getting out of it,Is the pleasure as much as I thought I would get?"

# III.pattern
***Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions is the brainchild of behavioral economist Dan Ariely.***

***In it, he posits that our decisions are not only irrational, but are also systematic and predictable.***

***"My goal," states Ariely, "is to help you fundamentally rethink what makes you and the people around you tick."***

***And in doing so, raise awareness of how emotions, expectations and context can lead you astray.***

***Here are some quotes from the book.***

***"Most people don't know what they want unless they see it in context."***

***"This is the problem of relativity — we look at our decisions in a relative way and compare them locally to the available alternative."***

***The "great law of human action" is "that in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make it difficult to attain."***

***"Although initial prices are 'arbitrary,' once those prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices."***

***Thus, "With everything you do... you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors" and "find the right antidote to each behavioral problem."***
