# book_predictably_irrational.
# I.preduictably irrational by Dan Ariely
## 1)the book in 3 sentences
- many of our behaviors are misguided.

- but they're not random;they're systematic and predictable.

- by recognizing our irrational patterns,we can make better decisions in life and business.

## 2)the five big ideas
- we tend to focus on what we may lose,rather than what we may gain.

- with everything you do,you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors.

- we assume other people will see monetary transactions from the same perspective as we do.

- people wiil work more for a cause than for cash.

- giving up on our long-term goals for immediate gratification is procrastination.

## 3)predictably irrational summary
- we tend to focus on the realtive advantage of one thing over another,and estimate value accordingly;

- once we buy a new product at a particular price,we become  anchored to that price.

- to improve an irrational behavior,ask yourself,"How did it begin?"second,ask yourself,"what amount of pleasure will I be getting out of it,Is the pleasure as much as I thought I would get?"

# II.grammar
# 1.in + v-ing
> The pattern "in + verb-ing" is the more formal version of "by + verb-ing," and it expresses that something occurs or can occur as a result of something else. For example, "In studying English, many students hope to gain more job opportunities."

> Likewise, in today's lesson, we learned that the Ariely hopes to give you (the reader) a better understanding of why people think and behave the way they do. "And in doing so" or by doing this, he hopes to "raise awareness of how emotions, expectations and context can lead you astray."

> Note that although "in + verb-ing" is frequently used to express goals or positive results, it can also be used to express negative or accidental results as well.For instance, "In trying to solve one problem, I created several others."

# III.pattern
***Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions is the brainchild of behavioral economist Dan Ariely.***

***In it, he posits that our decisions are not only irrational, but are also systematic and predictable.***

***"My goal," states Ariely, "is to help you fundamentally rethink what makes you and the people around you tick."***

***And in doing so, raise awareness of how emotions, expectations and context can lead you astray.***

***Here are some quotes from the book.***

***"Most people don't know what they want unless they see it in context."***

***"This is the problem of relativity — we look at our decisions in a relative way and compare them locally to the available alternative."***

***The "great law of human action" is "that in order to make a man covet a thing, it is only necessary to make it difficult to attain."***

***"Although initial prices are 'arbitrary,' once those prices are established in our minds they will shape not only present prices but also future prices."***

***Thus, "With everything you do... you should train yourself to question your repeated behaviors" and "find the right antidote to each behavioral problem."***
