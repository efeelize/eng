# I.Quick facts on dating culture in the US 
# 1.Marriage is not (always) the ultimate goal
> American people will think through and through before they decide to get married. They will make sure that their partner is the right one worth spending their life with. Thus, people who date in America are not all ended up being married. 

# 2.Parents' involvement is minimal [父母基本不参与其中]
> In some countries, parents are deeply involved in their children's relationship. They even become the matchmaker /'mætʃ'mekɚ/ [媒人] between their children and set up the marriage [包办婚姻] for them. In the US, once you hit 18 and become a legal adult, you are free to make a decision on your own. Parents do not involve much in their children's dating.

# 3.Your pet takes part in your relationships
> Believe it or not, your home pet takes part in the longevity of your relationship. When you move in together with your partner, its part in your relationship becomes bigger. A few American couples break up because they don't like the pet that their partner has. So, make sure that your partner doesn’t only love you but your pet as well.

# I.Love at first sight may have a biological basis
> It’s Saturday night and the bar is packed [挤满了人]. A beautiful brunette /bru'nɛt/ [n.黑发女郎] is sitting at the bar, sipping a vodka soda and chatting with a friend. Out of the corner of her eye, she catches the glimpse of a man. Their eyes lock.And they lived happily ever after.But is it really that easy?

> In fact, researchers who study human attraction say, people do tend to form opinions quickly [迅速形成意见] when it comes to romance. Some think it takes just three minutes to decide whether someone’s a potential mate (and that’s before the drinks arrive).

> Findings [研究] about friends who click immediately might also apply to romantic partnerships. In one study on friendships, people who enjoyed the first few minutes together were likely to develop a close relationship after nine weeks.

> But instant attraction isn’t just in our heads: There may be a biological basis [生物学基础] to love at first sight.Studies have found that animals are more likely to mate with partners they’re genetically compatible with [遗传上相容的]. It’s unclear whether this research applies to humans, but some scientists think we might be preprogrammed [先天预设] to spot “the one.” Romantic attraction might serve an evolutionary function [起到进化的作用]: We seek out [寻找] specific people who will be suitable mates, and we give everyone else the boot [踢掉其他人].

> Although about half the American population believes in love at first sight, not everyone falls head over heels right away [不是每个人都立马神魂颠倒坠入爱河].Perhaps surprisingly, women aren’t always the romantics: One study found that men experience love at first sight more often than women. Researchers think that’s because men respond to physical cues [肢体信号] more readily than women, and women tend to develop trust more gradually than men.

> But it’s unclear how often love at first sight turns into a successful partnership.Sometimes one look is all it takes to fall in love [只需要一瞬间]. But some experts think real affection develops gradually over time.

# I.Ways to ask if someone has a boyfriend or girlfriend
> Even if you are a nosy [爱管闲事] relative, it can still come across as awkward or even a little rude to ask someone if they have a boyfriend or girlfriend directly. That's why in today's dialogue we see Lulu's relatives using different expressions to try to find out if she is dating someone.

- Tell us about your love life.

- Are you seeing anyone? 

- Is there anyone special in your life? 

> You don't necessarily need to memorize these questions word for word. Inquiries about a person's love life will often use elements from these questions, but might end up taking a different form. A person could ask "Are you seeing anyone special?" or "do you have a special someone?", for example. You could also ask "are you involved" with anyone, but the word "involved" often has the connotation /ˌkɑnə'teʃən/ [n.内涵；含蓄] of being connected to some kind of criminal activity. "How's your love life" is pretty direct, but it's still better than "Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?" because at least it gives the person an opportunity to say something other than "yes" or "no".

> There is another sneaky [adj.狡猾的] tactic that is often used by both nosy relatives and regular people (both men and women) looking for dates. Just assume that the person does have a significant other [先假定有另一半], and then ask something about that supposed relationship. For example, you could ask "what did your boyfriend get you for Valentine's Day/your birthday/Christmas". If the person is seeing someone, then they can tell you about the gift and, indirectly, their boyfriend. If they aren't seeing anyone or don't want to tell you, then this gives them the opportunity to answer in the way they so choose.

# I.







# II.grammar
# 1.一见钟情
## 1）At first &  love at first sight/ bite/fight & at first glance/ blush 
> 1）most of the time “at first” doesn’t imply something continuing in this way. Rather, it means that in the beginning, the situation was one way (or seemed to be one way), but then at some point it changed.

> 2)“Love at first sight” has a very specific meaning: from the moment one person sees another person, they fall in love with them and, importantly, continue to love them over time. At first is a tiny phrase that can either be used on its own or found in other phrases such as “love at first sight”.

> 3)Of course, we also played around a bit with the phrase “love at first sight” in our dialogue, giving the phrase “love at first bite”. You could really put any word in place of “sight” and it will be understood as something that continues. For example, if a man fell in love with a woman who was a professional fighter, he could say that it was “love at first fight”.

> 4)We see this in other phrases containing “at first” as well: “at first glance” and “at first blush” both imply that something seemed one way in the beginning, but didn’t or couldn’t continue.

- 1. At first I thought he was a genius, but over time I realized he was a madman.

- 2. The plan looks good at first glance, but when you really look into it, you can see its flaws.

- 3. When Thomas Edison produced the first commercial light bulb, it was love at first light!

## 2）hit it off [phr.一拍即合] 
> we hit it off meaning that they got along really well from the beginning.So there's another good phrase that you don't only need to use when you're talking about romance like we can use that when we're talking about friends, coworkers, fellow travelers,anyone.

## 3）spark [n.火花] & & we have chemistry
> 1) so spark really has this kind of romantic idea. It's just connection between two people.because you can't have a fire without a spark. Spark is just that little little hot light burning and it's the thing that starts the fire.so often when we talk about relationships, you can say that they met, you know, they hit it off and sparks flew.Not all relationships spark, in the same way, we can use this as a verb as well as a noun。

> 2)There's another phrase we use, that is "We have chemistry."So that one is like more often used for romantic relationships. so chemistry here I'm not talking about mixing chemicals exactly. I'm talking about this feeling that you have between two people.if you meet someone for the first time. 

## 4）you guys would really click [v.合得来] 
> Click" is a word we use a lot. It means get along well.especially with romantic couples,It could be a friend maybe, like "My friend and I didn't click,"  But maybe if you meet someone at the bar, you might just click.

## 5)fell in love [phr.陷入热恋] & fall out of love [phr.失恋]
> 1）fall in love is a chunk here.There aren't very many ways to say like start to love.we really just say fall in love. They often say that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

> 2)For example if you, you know, you're in a relationship for a long time. And you just stopped loving each other than you just fall out of love.

# 2.grew on you & on paper [phr.理论上]
> It's a great expression that just kind of means at first it was sort of, um, not so great or just ok. And now, it's wonderful!so you come to like something. Maybe you have great chemistry right away. You hit it off but not always with everybody, sometimes this relationship needs to develop. And in that case sometimes it needs to kind of grow on you, sometimes this relationship needs to develop.

- 1. The idea of working from home is really starting to grow on me.

- 2. I used to think that Todd was such a weird guy, but then his personality really started to grow on me.

- 3. It took a long time for coffee to grow on me, but now I can’t live without it.

> 2)"on paper," it means in theory or the idea. It should be fine but maybe it's not.When you actually do something, it doesn't always work out the way you thought, or the way it was on paper.you can also think about your dating profiles.And maybe when you look at their profile, hey, it looks like we're going to be a good match, we are a good match on paper. But when you actually meet the person, it's not the same.

> 3)If you're talking about a job interview,I might say he looks good on paper but we'll see how he does in the job interview. So when I say he looks good on paper, I mean his resume looks good.maybe he has a great resume, but he's really awkward and he is not very good with people.

# 3.date
## 1)seeing [v.交往] 
> This word here "seeing," it's another way to say "dating,"Usually in the early part of the relationship before it gets really serious.and we usually use this in the progressive, like "Have you been seeing anyone?" "Are you seeing anyone?"We don't say "Do you see anyone?"

## 2)Are you seeing anyone? 
> 1)So this word "seeing" goes really well with "lately" or "recently," seeing anyone lately, seeing anyone recently.And you can use this in a question too, Like, "How long has she been seeing him?"she's been seeing him for a couple weeks.

> 2) Are you seeing anyone actually refers to are you dating anyone.are you in a relationship with anyone?are you dating?

## 3)looking to [phr.想要]
> looking to: it just means that want to.So someone might say I'm not looking to get a new job right now.Or some people might even say like I'm not looking to cause any trouble, not looking to start a fight.

- 1. I'm not looking to make a million dollars here. I'm just looking to do something more meaningful with my time.

- 2. She's looking to make a big career change after Chinese New Year.

- 3. We're looking to buy our first home, but we're just not sure that it's the right time.

## 4)set sb up on/go on a blind date [phr.安排和别人约会] 
> So a blind date is just a date with someone that you haven't met before or you haven't spoken to before.It doesn't really mean that the date is blind, that she or he cannot see anything. We often use blind like if the sun is really bright and it's shining in your eyes, we say "Oh, the sun was blinding. I can't see."But a blind date is different from online dating, Because with online dating, you usually talk to the person before.And you can at least see a picture.

## 5)set sb up with a job/friends
> to set sb up,this means to arrange a meeting,so usually we say "go on a date" or "set someone up on a date."You can set someone up with, but that is used in different situations.I could set you up with my friend.Or you can set somebody up with a job.So "with" can be used for people or jobs, but we use "on" with the word "date."

## 6)scene [n.景色、场合] & dating scene [n.约会场合]
> 1)Now the word "scene," you might have seen in the phrase "movie scene."There are lots of scenes there. Like you said a part of a movie, it could be a view like a gorgeous scene on the mountain.

> 2)But when we're talking about the dating scene, this is the situation where you are looking around for a date.It just means situation. this is what you're doing these days. Or I personally don't really go to clubs very much because clubs are not really my scene.

> 3)maybe if you just broke up with someone, you might want to get back into the dating scene.

## 7)to give/ have a shot [phr.试试看] 
> 1)to "give it a shot," this just means to try it.I think of like sports, like, he shoots, he scores or maybe he didn't score. When you shoot, when you give it a shot, you're just trying.So you might try to shoot in that sense.

> 2)You can sometimes say "have a shot," like "I had a shot at it but it didn't work."

## 8) see where it goes from there [phr.看看怎么样]
> see where it goes, it could go anywhere, right? I mean they could fall in love, they could be love at first sight.or it could go horrendously /hɔˈrɛndəs/ [adv.可怕的,恐怖的] downhill."see where it goes from there" and this is kind of something like, really kind of encouraging that people tell you when they want you to, just like try something. cause it could be great, You see where it goes. And one phrase I always use is play it by ear. And they're not exactly the same, but you can see how they are kind of related. It's just you're not making a plan, you're just going to kind of see, just see how it goes.

# 4.personality
## 1）I have a type [phr.有自己喜欢的类型]
> So if you say "I have a type," it means there is a specific kind of person that you like. I mean you could say "Oh, she's totally his type" or "He's totally her type."

## 2）picky [adj.挑剔的] 
> So if you're picky, there's like a lot of people or a lot of things you just don't like. For example, I could say he's picky about food. He doesn't eat seafood and vegetable.maybe like, when I go shopping for clothes, I'm a little picky, cause some clothes just don't look good on me.

## 3）easygoing [adj.随和的]
> when someone's easygoing, they don't get mad easily. They don't get stressed out easily.If you're someone that always says, "Don't worry about it, and it's okay. No problem." then maybe you're easygoing.But we only use easygoing for people.We can't use it for things like I can't say "I went on an easygoing date."It's really just for personalities exactly.

## 4）bias [n. & v.] & prejudice
> 1)it's kind of the prejudice. It's how you, like personal ideas maybe affect your thinking.so bias could be a noun, I have a bias against. I'm sure a lot of things or could be a verb, I am biased against something. Many people, their biases are very mean. like, oh, you have a different color skin than me. Therefore you are not as good as me.

## 5)brainy /'breni/ [adj.有头脑的]
> So, as you can imagine, the word brainy means intelligent. It means you have lots of brains.super smart, right. there's a little bit of truth behind Auntie's opinion here. Like guys, don't tend to like to marry, you know, like girls that are smarter than them. It makes them feel very small.

## 6)attraction [n.吸引] & attractive [adj.]
> 1)so attraction is kind of liking someone.

> 2)And attractive is the adjective and when you find someone attractive, you think that they are good looking or have a good personality.not everyone feels these kinds of instant attractions with their partners. Maybe the first time you see your partner, sure, if they are attractive, that's great you will probably feel an attraction. But may be for example this person is very, very intelligent or very very caring, it's really hard to see that on the surface.so there's many different ways that people could be attracted to others.And that also leads to a person growing on you as well.

## 7)far-fetched [adj.牵强的]
> 1)Far-fetched, This is one of those words that my parents use a lot, specifically my dad uses a lot. Far-fetched means it's kind of crazy.That's actually a really good way to put it. It's just not believable, Like when we lie, we tried to tell good lies, like I was late because traffic, not I was late because aliens came and they destroyed the car. I had to walk and then more aliens came.That's kind of far-fetched.No one is gonna to believe it.

> 2)so far-fetched we can use for ideas, we can use for stories. But we could also use for things like plans, like if someone has a plan. That's not really good, you could probably say, that's a bit far-fetched.

## 8)opened / narrow minded [adj.目光短浅的] 
> 1）so we all know about open-minded. That's great. you're open to new ideas, you're open to new ways. 

> 2)Narrow-minded is kind of the opposite, so narrow-minded means that maybe you can only see something a certain way. You're a little bit stubborn and you can't really, how should I say put yourself in other people shoes.

## 9)wired [adj.热衷的，兴奋的]
> 1)Wired. I love this one because I always hear about like, the way men are wired or the way women are wired. And it kind of just means like the way that something or someone is designed or put together. So, here it could refer to the way that he was brought up just basically his education and what he was taught to think or believe. And it's really hard, especially you know the older you get to kind of change those, those beliefs or those thought patterns.

> 2)So, Auntie and uncle here are kind of wired to think that marriage, or having a romantic partner is the most important thing.Actually makes me think about like a, like an old computer, right? Like we have this distinction between hardware and software. Everything these days is software, software, software. But way back in the day, everything was hardware, like, if you wanted to computer to do something, you, you actually had to, you know like connect a wire to another thing, to another thing. So you can almost imagine like this old computer like, "Are you married? Are you married?" It's the only thing that it can do.

## 8)butterflies in your stomach 忐忑不安 

## 9)weak knees 腿软 

## 10)fix （一剂）让人满足的东西 

















# 6.a sense of sth sight / smell /taste /direction
> 1)Sense.It really just means feeling or in this case ability almost,ike ability to understand,and we often use this phrase "a sense of something." Like, we all have a sense of sight or smell or taste. 

> 2)But it could also be humor is like an ability, so it could be a sense of direction.So if you have no sense of direction, it means you can't understand directions and you often get lost. If you get lost a lot, maybe you don't have a good sense of direction, maybe you need your smartphone.

# 7.from the get-go [phr.从一开始]
> 1)Get-go means from the beginning basically.anytime you want to talk about the way I've done it from the beginning, from the start, you can also say from the get-go.

> 2)So for example someone might be teaching you how to do something at work, but you say I've actually been doing that from the get-go.means I've always been doing that.

> 3)I could also say, hey, like Adam's always been ready from the get-go. You're always ready for everything.

# 8.left behind [n.剩女; 留下; 遗留] & to be /get left over & the clock is ticking [phr.时间在流逝] & came out wrong [phr.说错了]
> 1) Chinese culture does have the concept of "women who are left behind", and it's not exactly positive.We don't really have that concept in English,you don't want to say that to someone. It could be a little bit offensive.

> 2) When you "leave something behind", it means to go somewhere and not bring a certain thing with you. It could be something serious like leaving behind family members, or something less serious like forgetting your keys at home.

> 3)"Leave behind" can also mean "increase the distance" by which one is ahead of someone or something else.I think about like soldiers, like no man gets left behind. We see this a lot when we talk about the economy: Some people succeed, and others get left behind.So maybe your friends are really successful and you feel like you've been left behind.

> 4)  If something is leftover, like I tend to think it's food.like leftover turkey after Thanksgiving. Maybe leftover dumplings after Chinese New year.sIn this case, it means that something was not used or consumed, as in "there was a lot of wine left over from the party". Probably the most common way that you will see this word though is as an adjective, "leftover", which would allow you to say the phrase above as "there was a lot of leftover wine after the party".

- 1. My favorite part of Thanksgiving is all the leftover turkey!

- 2. Our new education policies will ensure that no student gets left behind!

- 3. Grandpa always tells us the story of how he was almost left behind during the war.

- 4. These refugees /'rɛfjʊdʒi/ [n.避难者;难民] had to leave everything behind in order to find safety and freedom.

> 5)it just means that, you know, time continues to march on. you're not getting any younger.so this clock she's talking about is the biological clock.

> 6)so maybe you have something that you want to say or communicate and maybe you get the idea across. But the problem here is, it might come out a little bit rude.

# 9.commit to goals/job [v.承诺] & commitment [n.] & ease up on sth [phr.减轻、放松]
> 1)So here she's talking about committing to a relationship, and that means to promise to be with that person."Commit" really just means promise. When you do something that's hard to do, like, losing weight or staying healthy and eating, it's hard to commit to those goals.It's hard to promise to do them and continue to do them. Now you can also commit to a job, and that is when you promise to stay with this job, like maybe for a long time and work hard.

> 2)the noun of this word "commit" is "commitment." For example, getting a dog or a pet is a big commitment.Or getting married is a big commitment.

> 3)ease up on someone, kind of means don't be such a jerk to them, just, just relax when you're around them.

- 1. My doctor told me that I should ease up on the drinking and smoking.

- 2. As a parent, I know that I need to ease up on my children. But I'm so worried that if I do, they won't be successful!

- 3. If you ease up on the golf club a bit, you will have a better swing.[握杆稍微放松一些，你的挥杆就会更好]

# 10.have/got your back [phr.支持你、做你的后盾] & thanks a million
> 1)one of the thing to pay attention to hear is that, like other times in English you can always switch the word got for have, So, got your back is kind of a little bit more casual, maybe a little bit more friendly.

- 1. Before you get into a difficult situation, you need to ask yourself "who has my back?"

- 2. My friends have my back, and that gives me great confidence.

- 3. Even though they might not always get along, brothers should always have each other's backs.

> 2)it just means thanks a lot. but it's like really emphasize here, right? Because it's not just a lot, it's thanks a million.

# 11.instant [adj.立即的] & instant coffee/rice/noodles/attraction
> 1)Instant is an adjective and it just means right away, like so for example we have instant coffee, instant rice, and these things are just things that will cook right away.You don't have to wait, But of course we're not talking about coffee or noodles here, we're talking about this attraction, this idea of two things coming together, or one thing going to another thing. But in love we would like to think about it as two things coming together.

> 2)And it's hard to have an instant attraction to something like. Yeah, intelligence or some kind of deeper, not as outside sort of traits, mean it would be nice if you could like them from the get-go, but that just doesn't always happen all the time.but of course if you guys are in a long-term relationship, you will probably look back at your earlier times together. you might remember them kind of differently, you might think that oh, they were so beautiful and wonderful and you might forget about the fights in the the games that you play on text messaging and stuff like that.

# 12.a little much [phr.多一点]
> 1)A little much. this kind of sounds like from a grammatical point of view. It might sound a little strange, but just try to think about this as a chunk. Something or someone, usually someone is a little much.

> 2)So, this word is generally a little bit negative and it's kind of got the same meaning as too much. So, here the Auntie is little too eager. One of the thing that I would think of is like difficult to get along with, or even hard to handle, is a phrase that comes to mind. Just, just kind of difficult people.

# 13.even if it were /虚拟语气
> 1)This is a perfect example of the subjunctive mood in English: the verb form that is used to express a wish, a suggestion, a command, or a condition that is contrary to fact.[用动词不同的时态来表达愿望、建议、命令或者和事实相反的条件]

> 2)In this case, the subjunctive is formed by using "were" with the 1st and 3rd person singular, in place of the normal past form was, which is why the phrase is "even if it were", not "even if it was". Although we can call this the "past subjunctive", it is not necessarily connected to any period in time.[用“were”替换了第一人称和第三人称单数常见的be动词过去式“was”，构成虚拟语气，这就是为什么写作“even if it were”，而不是“even if it was”的原因。虽然我们可以称之为过去虚拟语气，但是它不一定和什么时间点相关。]

> 3)what if you want to say "even if it was"? Would that be grammatically incorrect? That really depends who you ask. The subjunctive mood is quite formal and academic, so if you are writing, try to stick to it. In daily speech, the subjunctive is used much less, so you will hear phrases like "even if it was". [那如果你要说“even if it was”呢？这句话语法上是错误的吗？这就取决于你问谁了。虚拟语气是非常正式和学术的，如果你是在写作中用到，那就要严格按照规则来。在日常口语中虚拟语气用得很少，所以你会听到“even if it was”这样的表达]

- 1. Even if the tickets were free, I still wouldn't go to such a mindless show.[即使票是免费的，我也不会去看这种无聊的演出]

- 2. Even if he were the last man on earth, I wouldn't date him! [即使世上就他一个男人，我也不会和他约会！]

- 3. Even if that were true, which it isn't, it wouldn't change anything. [即使这是真的，也改变不了什么，况且还不是真的]

***Oh ease up on her, darling. A girl as beautiful as Lulu won’t have any problems finding a match.***

***You know, Old Wang next door has a nephew who’s single. I heard he just bought a house in the city. Maybe we can set you two up.***

***I’m not interested in blind dates, Auntie.***

***Who said anything about a blind date? We’ll all just get together for a chat and see where it goes from there. I’ll just go grab his phone number!***

***Lulu, I know she can be a little much, but she only wants what’s best for you.***

***I understand that, Uncle. I just wish she could be a bit less narrow-minded.***

***Well now that she’s gone, you can tell your old uncle. Is there anyone special in your life?***

***Sorry, sorry! It’s just the way our generation is wired. We didn’t have the opportunities you kids have today. We had to be more practical.***

***Do you think what I’m doing isn’t practical too, Uncle?***

***Sorry, that came out wrong. Personally, I think it’s great what you’re doing. As long as you follow your heart, your old uncle will always have your back.***

***Thanks a million, Uncle!***

***Jim, why do you think people fall in love?***

***Well, according to neuroscience, love acts on the brain in the same way addiction does, much like how people crave alcohol and nicotine.***

***Come again?***

***When you fall in love, the same brain region that produces dopamine lights up.***

***Ah, that explains the bodily reactions: butterflies in your stomach, weak knees. Not to mention all that obsessive thinking and separation anxiety.***

***Right, it all has evolutionary roots. If our ancestors didn't get that dopamine fix, then we might not be around today.***

***But aren't we just talking about the passion stage here? What makes a relationship last?***

***In a long-term relationship, the brain activity shifts to a region that's linked with controlling stress and emotion.***

***So sex drive motivates you to look at a whole range of partners, but romantic love is about focusing your mating energy on one person at a time?***

***Right. Over time, as long as love remains, we get used to the relationship. Since we're not afraid our partner will leave us, we're not as focused on the craving.***

***It's interesting as a thought experiment. But I'm not sure we can reduce something as complex and rich as love to brain systems.***

***I really don't think it's all that reductionist. And even if it were, that doesn't make love any less enjoyable.***

***Truly, love is a many splendored thing.***
