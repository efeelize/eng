# Love

# I.Quick facts on dating culture in the US 
# 1.Marriage is not (always) the ultimate goal
> American people will think through and through before they decide to get married. They will make sure that their partner is the right one worth spending their life with. Thus, people who date in America are not all ended up being married. 

# 2.Parents' involvement is minimal [父母基本不参与其中]
> In some countries, parents are deeply involved in their children's relationship. They even become the matchmaker /'mætʃ'mekɚ/ [媒人] between their children and set up the marriage [包办婚姻] for them. In the US, once you hit 18 and become a legal adult, you are free to make a decision on your own. Parents do not involve much in their children's dating.

# 3.Your pet takes part in your relationships
> Believe it or not, your home pet takes part in the longevity of your relationship. When you move in together with your partner, its part in your relationship becomes bigger. A few American couples break up because they don't like the pet that their partner has. So, make sure that your partner doesn’t only love you but your pet as well.

# I.Love at first sight may have a biological basis
> It’s Saturday night and the bar is packed [挤满了人]. A beautiful brunette /bru'nɛt/ [n.黑发女郎] is sitting at the bar, sipping a vodka soda and chatting with a friend. Out of the corner of her eye, she catches the glimpse of a man. Their eyes lock.And they lived happily ever after.But is it really that easy?

> In fact, researchers who study human attraction say, people do tend to form opinions quickly [迅速形成意见] when it comes to romance. Some think it takes just three minutes to decide whether someone’s a potential mate (and that’s before the drinks arrive).

> Findings [研究] about friends who click immediately might also apply to romantic partnerships. In one study on friendships, people who enjoyed the first few minutes together were likely to develop a close relationship after nine weeks.

> But instant attraction isn’t just in our heads: There may be a biological basis [生物学基础] to love at first sight.Studies have found that animals are more likely to mate with partners they’re genetically compatible with [遗传上相容的]. It’s unclear whether this research applies to humans, but some scientists think we might be preprogrammed [先天预设] to spot “the one.” Romantic attraction might serve an evolutionary function [起到进化的作用]: We seek out [寻找] specific people who will be suitable mates, and we give everyone else the boot [踢掉其他人].

> Although about half the American population believes in love at first sight, not everyone falls head over heels right away [不是每个人都立马神魂颠倒坠入爱河].Perhaps surprisingly, women aren’t always the romantics: One study found that men experience love at first sight more often than women. Researchers think that’s because men respond to physical cues [肢体信号] more readily than women, and women tend to develop trust more gradually than men.

> But it’s unclear how often love at first sight turns into a successful partnership.Sometimes one look is all it takes to fall in love [只需要一瞬间]. But some experts think real affection develops gradually over time.

# I.Ways to ask if someone has a boyfriend or girlfriend
> Even if you are a nosy [爱管闲事] relative, it can still come across as awkward or even a little rude to ask someone if they have a boyfriend or girlfriend directly. That's why in today's dialogue we see Lulu's relatives using different expressions to try to find out if she is dating someone.

- Tell us about your love life.

- Are you seeing anyone? 

- Is there anyone special in your life? 

> You don't necessarily need to memorize these questions word for word. Inquiries about a person's love life will often use elements from these questions, but might end up taking a different form. A person could ask "Are you seeing anyone special?" or "do you have a special someone?", for example. You could also ask "are you involved" with anyone, but the word "involved" often has the connotation /ˌkɑnə'teʃən/ [n.内涵；含蓄] of being connected to some kind of criminal activity. "How's your love life" is pretty direct, but it's still better than "Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?" because at least it gives the person an opportunity to say something other than "yes" or "no".

> There is another sneaky [adj.狡猾的] tactic that is often used by both nosy relatives and regular people (both men and women) looking for dates. Just assume that the person does have a significant other [先假定有另一半], and then ask something about that supposed relationship. For example, you could ask "what did your boyfriend get you for Valentine's Day/your birthday/Christmas". If the person is seeing someone, then they can tell you about the gift and, indirectly, their boyfriend. If they aren't seeing anyone or don't want to tell you, then this gives them the opportunity to answer in the way they so choose.

# I.why do we fall in love
> Love, as the song says, is a many-splendored thing [非常美妙]. So, when we find it, we're keen to enjoy the spoils [尽情享受胜利的果实]. But what is it about humans that makes us long for love in the first place? It turns out the most inherent reason is also probably the least romantic.

> Generally speaking, human 'pair bonding' [‘成双结对’] is a drive to keep the species in existence,[物种得以持续存在的驱动力]" explains Dr. Nicki Nance, licensed psychotherapist [持证心理医疗师] and professor at Beacon College in Leesburg, Florida in an email interview [邮件采访]. Over time, the tendency to find a love connection evolved from relationships built on need to those of enjoyment.[从寻找基于需求的亲密关系进化为寻找基于快乐的亲密关系] 

> "Today, falling in love is socially defined. If we didn't have love stories to establish the expectation of falling in love, we might not do it. We would still bond, though," she says, noting that contemporary love is more successful when key components like passion, companionship [陪伴] and commitment [承诺] are present.

> "When we are in the company of the loved one, the brain produces more serotonin [血清素], which gives a sense of well-being, more endorphins [内啡肽], which are natural pain killers, and more dopamine [多巴胺], which increases pleasure. The good feeling is a reward that makes us want more," Nance explains.

# II.grammar
# 1.even if it were /虚拟语气
> 1)This is a perfect example of the subjunctive mood in English: the verb form that is used to express a wish, a suggestion, a command, or a condition that is contrary to fact.[用动词不同的时态来表达愿望、建议、命令或者和事实相反的条件]

> 2)In this case, the subjunctive is formed by using "were" with the 1st and 3rd person singular, in place of the normal past form was, which is why the phrase is "even if it were", not "even if it was". Although we can call this the "past subjunctive", it is not necessarily connected to any period in time.[用“were”替换了第一人称和第三人称单数常见的be动词过去式“was”，构成虚拟语气，这就是为什么写作“even if it were”，而不是“even if it was"的原因。虽然我们可以称之为过去虚拟语气，但是它不一定和什么时间点相关。]

> 3)what if you want to say "even if it was"? Would that be grammatically incorrect? That really depends who you ask. The subjunctive mood is quite formal and academic, so if you are writing, try to stick to it.In daily speech, the subjunctive is used much less, so you will hear phrases like "even if it was". [虚拟语气是非常正式和学术的，如果你是在写作中用到，那就要严格按照规则来。在日常口语中虚拟语气用得很少，所以你会听到“even if it was”这样的表达]

- 1. Even if the tickets were free, I still wouldn't go to such a mindless show.[即使票是免费的，我也不会去看这种无聊的演出]

- 2. Even if he were the last man on earth, I wouldn't date him! [即使世上就他一个男人，我也不会和他约会！]

- 3. Even if that were true, which it isn't, it wouldn't change anything. [即使这是真的，也改变不了什么，况且还不是真的]

# 2.一见钟情
## 1）At first &  love at first sight/ bite/fight & at first glance/ blush 
> 1）most of the time “at first” doesn’t imply something continuing in this way. Rather, it means that in the beginning, the situation was one way (or seemed to be one way), but then at some point it changed.

> 2)“Love at first sight” has a very specific meaning: from the moment one person sees another person, they fall in love with them and, importantly, continue to love them over time. At first is a tiny phrase that can either be used on its own or found in other phrases such as “love at first sight”.

> 3)“love at first bite”. You could really put any word in place of “sight” and it will be understood as something that continues. For example, if a man fell in love with a woman who was a professional fighter, he could say that it was “love at first fight”.

> 4)We see this in other phrases containing “at first” as well: “at first glance” and “at first blush” both imply that something seemed one way in the beginning, but didn’t or couldn’t continue.

- 1. At first I thought he was a genius, but over time I realized he was a madman.

- 2. The plan looks good at first glance, but when you really look into it, you can see its flaws.

- 3. When Thomas Edison produced the first commercial light bulb, it was love at first light!

## 2）hit it off [phr.一拍即合] 
> we hit if off meaning that they got along really well from the beginning.So there's another good phrase that you don't only need to use when you're talking about romance like we can use that when we're talking about friends, coworkers, fellow travelers,anyone.

## 3）spark [n.火花] & & we have chemistry
> 1) so spark really has this kind of romantic idea. It's just connection between two people.because you can't have a fire without a spark. Spark is just that little  hot light burning and it's the thing that starts the fire.so often when we talk about relationships, you can say that they met, they hit it off and sparks flew. Not all relationships spark, in the same way, we can use this as a verb as well as a noun.

> 2) "We have chemistry."So that one is like more often used for romantic relationships. so chemistry here I'm not talking about mixing chemicals exactly. I'm talking about this feeling that you have between two people.if you meet someone for the first time. 

## 4）you guys would really click [v.合得来] 
> Click" is a word we use a lot. It means get along well.especially with romantic couples,It could be a friend maybe, like "My friend and I didn't click,"  But maybe if you meet someone at the bar, you might just click.

## 5)fell in love [phr.陷入热恋] & fall out of love [phr.失恋]
> 1）fall in love is a chunk here.There aren't very many ways to say like start to love.we really just say fall in love. They often say that the way to a man's heart is through his stomach.

> 2)For example if you're in a relationship for a long time. And you just stopped loving each other than you just fall out of love.

# 3.date
## 1)seeing [v.交往] 
> "seeing" here is another way to say "dating,"Usually in the early part of the relationship before it gets really serious.and we usually use this in the progressive, like "Have you been seeing anyone?" "Are you seeing anyone?"We don't say "Do you see anyone?"

## 2)Are you seeing anyone? 
> 1)So this word "seeing" goes really well with "lately" or "recently," seeing anyone lately, seeing anyone recently.And you can use this in a question too, Like, "How long has she been seeing him?"she's been seeing him for a couple weeks.

> 2) Are you seeing anyone actually refers to are you dating anyone.are you in a relationship with anyone?are you dating?

## 3)looking to [phr.想要]
> it's just means that want to.So someone might say I'm not looking to get a new job right now.Or some people might even say like I'm not looking to cause any trouble, not looking to start a fight.

- 1. I'm not looking to make a million dollars here. I'm just looking to do something more meaningful with my time.

- 2. She's looking to make a big career change after Chinese New Year.

- 3. We're looking to buy our first home, but we're just not sure that it's the right time.

## 4)set sb up on/go on a blind date [phr.安排和别人约会] 
> 1)So a blind date is just a date with sb that you haven't met before or you haven't spoken to before.It doesn't really mean that the date is blind, that she or he cannot see anything. 

> 2)We often use blind like if the sun is really bright and it's shining in your eyes, we say "Oh, the sun was blinding. I can't see."

> 3)But a blind date is different from online dating, Because with online dating, you usually talk to the person before.And you can at least see a picture.

## 5)set sb up with a job/friends
> 1)this means to arrange a meeting,so usually we say "go on a date" or "set someone up on a date."

> 2)You can use it in different situations.I could set you up with my friend.Or you can set somebody up with a job.So "with" can be used for people or jobs, but we use "on" with the word "date."

## 6)scene [n.景色、场合] & dating scene [n.约会场合]
> 1)Now the word "scene," you might have seen in the phrase "movie scene."There are lots of scenes there. Like you said a part of a movie, it could be a view like a gorgeous scene on the mountain.

> 2)But when we're talking about the dating scene, this is the situation where you are looking around for a date.It just means situation. this is what you're doing these days. Or I personally don't really go to clubs very much because clubs are not really my scene.

> 3)maybe if you just broke up with someone, you might want to get back into the dating scene.

## 7)to give/ have a shot [phr.试试看] 
> 1)to "give it a shot," this just means to try it.I think of like sports, like, he shoots, he scores or maybe he didn't score. When you shoot, when you give it a shot, you're just trying.So you might try to shoot in that sense.

> 2)You can sometimes say "have a shot," like "I had a shot at it but it didn't work."

## 8) see where it goes from there [phr.看看怎么样]
> see where it goes from there" and this is really kind of encouraging that people tell you when they want you to, just like try something. cause it could be great, You see where it goes. 

# 4.personality

## 4）bias [n. & v.] & prejudice

## 5)brainy /'breni/ [adj.有头脑的]

> 1)attraction is kind of liking someone.

Maybe the first time you see your partner, sure, if they are attractive, that's great you will probably feel an attraction. But may be for example this person is very intelligent or very caring, it's really hard to see that on the surface.so there's many different ways that people could be attracted to others.And that also leads to a person growing on you as well.

## 7)far-fetched [adj.牵强的]
> 1)Far-fetched means it's kind of crazy.That's actually a really good way to put it. It's just not believable, Like when we lie, we tried to tell good lies, like I was late because traffic, not I was late because aliens came and they destroyed the car. I had to walk and then more aliens came.That's kind of far-fetched.No one is gonna to believe it.

> 2)so far-fetched we can use for ideas, we can use for stories. But we could also use for things like if someone has a plan. That's not really good, you could probably say, that's a bit far-fetched.

> 2)sometimes it's not just even about coming up with an answer, It's just about maybe making a better question or something, like for example, one very famous thought experiment is called the trolley problem, and the reason why this is so famous, it basically just points to a situation where there's a trolley or a train coming and there's someone on the tracks.And they're going to get hit by the train, but you have the power to change the direction of the train, but if you change the direction of the train, you're going to kill two people.or maybe your gonna kill everyone on that train.Or maybe everyone on the train, but then you find out that everyone on the train are really bad.

We see this a lot when we talk about the economy: Some people succeed, and others get left behind.So maybe your friends are really successful and you feel like you've been left behind.

## 2)to be /get left over

But in love we would like to think about it as two things coming together.

> 2)And it's hard to have an instant attraction to something like intelligence or some kind of deeper, not as outside sort of traits, mean it would be nice if you could like them from the get-go, but that just doesn't always happen all the time.but of course if you guys are in a long-term relationship, you will probably look back at your earlier times together. you might remember them kind of differently, you might think that oh, they were so beautiful and wonderful and you might forget about the fights in the the games that you play on text messaging and stuff like that.

It should be fine but maybe it's not.When you actually do sth, it doesn't always work out the way you thought, or the way it was on paper.you can also think about your dating profiles.And maybe when you look at their profile, hey, it looks like we're going to be a good match, we are a good match on paper. But when you actually meet the person, it's not the same.

> 3)If you're talking about a job interview,I might say he looks good on paper but we'll see how he does in the job interview. So when I say he looks good on paper, I mean his resume looks good.maybe he has a great resume, but he's really awkward and he is not very good with people.

***Hey, Peter. Have you been seeing anyone lately?***

***Nah. Since Lindsay and I broke up, I've just been enjoying the dating scene.***

***In that case, I've got a single friend I think you'd like.***

***Oh, so you want to set me up on a blind date, do you?***

***Yep, you deserve someone special! I can show you a picture of her if it helps. She's really cute.***

***Okay, sure, but what's she like? I'm not picky but I do have a type.***

***She's super easygoing and has a great sense of humor.***

***That does sound like my type, but Lindsay and I were good on paper and it still didn't work out.***

***Honestly, I think you guys would really click. Plus, you don't have to commit to anything yet.***

***Alright, I'll give it a shot.***

***Great, I'll let her know!***

***Do you believe in love at first sight, Jen?***

***Personally, I’ve always thought the idea was a bit far-fetched.***

***Really? You’ve never experienced it? What about with your husband?***

***We hit it off, sure. But there was no spark. He just grew on me over time.***

***Not with my wife and me. When I first saw her, there was an instant attraction. I knew right away that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.***

***It could be because of outcome bias, meaning that because you guys are in a healthy long-term relationship now, you believe that it was great from the get-go.***

***Well, if that’s the case, then you should feel the same way, right?***

***I’m not sure. I actually read a study that said men reported they experienced love at first sight more than women.***

***I wonder if that includes your husband.***

***If you ask him, he’ll tell you that he fell in love with me after the first time I cooked for him.***

***Oh, so I guess you could say it was "love at first bite"!***

***Lulu! Tell us about your love life. Are you seeing anyone?***

***No Auntie. I’m trying to focus on finishing my PhD first.***

***Oh Lulu, no man wants to marry a brainy girl.***

***I’m not looking to get married any time soon, Auntie.***

***But the clock is ticking! You don’t want to get left behind!***

***Oh ease up on her, darling. A girl as beautiful as Lulu won’t have any problems finding a match.***

***You know, Old Wang next door has a nephew who’s single. I heard he just bought a house in the city. Maybe we can set you two up.***

***I’m not interested in blind dates, Auntie.***

***Who said anything about a blind date? We’ll all just get together for a chat and see where it goes from there. I’ll just go grab his phone number!***

***Lulu, I know she can be a little much, but she only wants what’s best for you.***

***I understand that, Uncle. I just wish she could be a bit less narrow-minded.***

***Well now that she’s gone, you can tell your old uncle. Is there anyone special in your life?***

***Sorry, sorry! It’s just the way our generation is wired. We didn’t have the opportunities you kids have today. We had to be more practical.***

***Do you think what I’m doing isn’t practical too, Uncle?***

***Sorry, that came out wrong. Personally, I think it’s great what you’re doing. As long as you follow your heart, your old uncle will always have your back.***

***Thanks a million, Uncle!***

***Jim, why do you think people fall in love?***

***Well, according to neuroscience, love acts on the brain in the same way addiction does, much like how people crave alcohol and nicotine.***

***Come again?***

***When you fall in love, the same brain region that produces dopamine lights up.***

***Ah, that explains the bodily reactions: butterflies in your stomach, weak knees. Not to mention all that obsessive thinking and separation anxiety.***

***Right, it all has evolutionary roots. If our ancestors didn't get that dopamine fix, then we might not be around today.***

***But aren't we just talking about the passion stage here? What makes a relationship last?***

***In a long-term relationship, the brain activity shifts to a region that's linked with controlling stress and emotion.***

***So sex drive motivates you to look at a whole range of partners, but romantic love is about focusing your mating energy on one person at a time?***

***Right. Over time, as long as love remains, we get used to the relationship. Since we're not afraid our partner will leave us, we're not as focused on the craving.***

***It's interesting as a thought experiment. But I'm not sure we can reduce something as complex and rich as love to brain systems.***

***I really don't think it's all that reductionist. And even if it were, that doesn't make love any less enjoyable.***

***Truly, love is a many splendored thing.***
