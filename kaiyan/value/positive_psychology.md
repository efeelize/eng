# Positive psychology
# I.Positive psychology [积极心理学]
> Today's lesson is based on the idea of positive psychology[积极心理学], one of the newest fields [最新领域] in psychology. Much like the saying, "An ounce /aʊns/ [少量] of prevention is worth a pound of cure,"[预防为主，治疗为辅] this branch [分支] of psychology focuses on effective intervention /ˌɪntɚ'vɛnʃən/ [有效预防] and utilizes scientific understanding to increase mental well-being[利用科学改善健康状况], rather than treating mental illness.[而不是治疗疾病]

> There have been countless studies[无数科学研究证明了] showing the many benefits of practising gratitude on mental health[感恩的心态]. It improves the emotional, social, health, personality, and even career aspects of our lives. 

> As we mentioned in the lesson, positive psychology is the newest branch in the broad field of psychology, and it's receiving so much attention in the media lately perhaps because it focuses on the opposite of what psychology traditionally concerned itself with [它的关注方面跟传统心理学完全相反]. Positive psychology concentrates on the positive aspects of life, like happiness and well-being, and personal growth, such as increasing one's potential, rather than eliminating shortcomings [克服缺点].

> Of course, it has its fair share of critics. Some think it lacks credibility due to its relative infancy [刚诞生]. Others think it's all about "happyology" and thinking positively [幸福学和积极思考], like a self-help book [鸡汤励志书] backed by some pseudo-science. Of course positive psychology isn't just about increasing happiness, although that is what attracts a lot of people to the subject [不全是提升幸福感，尽管这方面吸引了很多人。]. The findings cited in papers are based on actual studies [基于科学研究和实验的结果] that were conducted in scientific and measurable ways; they're not just a collection of anecdotal evidence.[不仅是一些奇闻轶事]

> Either way, gratitude has been identified in study after study as providing a host of benefits to every aspect of one's life [感激心理对生活的很多方面都有好处]. Practicing gratitude improves your health, your relationships, your emotional well-being, your personality, and your career. As with any habit, cultivating it takes time [培养感激需要时间], but all you have to do is set out five minutes of your day [花五分钟] and dedicate it to writing down what you are thankful for.[把自己认为需要感谢的人和事写下来] 

# II.Start your day with a positive mind
> When we wake up each morning, we often start our day without much conscious /'kɑnʃəs/ [adj.神志清醒的] thought about how we are feeling and what our intentions are for the day.What if, instead, we took a few minutes to consciously think about the day ahead of us? Start the day by being appreciative and grateful for what the world has to offer and what we have in our own lives.

> Often, there are things in life, which are not the way we want them to be. And that could create challenges and frustrations. But a small change in perception and approach could lead to a positive change in how we see and deal with challenges in the future. Morning is a wonderful time to create a new approach on how we see the world.It's like New Year's Day each morning: the ability to think anew /ə'nʊ/ [adv.再,重新].So start every day with positive and grateful thoughts.

# III.5 habits of happy people
# 1.Acts of kindness
> People who consistently volunteer or simply care for others are found to be happier. You don't need to volunteer in an organization. It can be as simple as reaching out to a coworker or friend who needs a helping hand.

# 2.Exercise and physical well-being
> Many studies are proving the ancient adage, "sound body, sound mind" to be true.Regular exercise can improve mental well-being and help combat depression.

# 3.Find your flow
>  If we are deeply involved in an activity that’s challenging but well-suited to our skills, we experience a joyful state called "flow."Many kinds of activities, such as sports and learning can produce the experience of flow where you are so deeply immersed in the experience that you forget about everything else.

# 4.Strengths and virtues
>  Studies in the field of positive psychology show that the happiest people are those that have discovered their unique strengths and virtues and use them for a purpose that’s greater than their own personal goals.

# 5.Positive mindset
> Optimism, mindfulness and gratitude. Of all these areas, gratitude has perhaps received the most attention in positive psychology.Grateful people have been shown to have greater positive emotion, a greater sense of belonging, and lower incidence of depression and stress.

# IV.grammar
# 1. positive psychology [phr.正向心理学、积极心理学] & depression /dɪˈpreʃən/ [抑郁]
> 1) "positive" contains the Latin root, "posit," which means "placed,"[安置] so it originally referred to laws as being "laid down" firmly without question[毫无疑义], leading to the eventual /ɪˈvɛntʃuəl/ [adj.(事件)最终发生的] meaning of "very sure." So, if someone asks you, "Are you sure?", you can reply, "Positive."

> 2)positive : mean "good" and "optimistic."So positive psychology is one branch within the whole huge of science of psychology. And basically what it is is that you focus on enhancing your life.
