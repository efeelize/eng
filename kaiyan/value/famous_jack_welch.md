# 1.what/why/where/how-cleft sentences [分裂句]
> A what-cleft sentence is a simple sentence that's been cleft (divided) into two parts, or two clauses. One clause becomes a what-clause because we add “what” to the start of it.

> The information in the wh-clause is typically old or understood information, while the information in the other clause is new and something we want to emphasize. A what-clause helps emphasis the second clause because it introduces or builds up focus towards it.

- We need more workers.-> What we need is more workers./More workers are what we need.

> To emphasize an action, the verb we use to describe that action is usually the same tense as the verb in the what-clause.
