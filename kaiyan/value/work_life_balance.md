# I.The future of jobs won’t be about 9-to-5 office hours
> The freelance marketplace is exploding, as more companies seek to hire freelancers as a way to snag /snæɡ/ [v.钩住、留住] the best talent. Yet many companies still hold strong to the traditional 9-to-5 workday. According to Upwork CEO Stephane Kasriel, remote work will be the norm [常态] within the next 10 years, as younger generations take the management reins[接手管理权].

> People notice that place-bound work [固定地点的工作] no longer makes sense. Collaboration technologies[协作技术], like Microsoft’s Office 365, Slack, Google Hangouts and Atlassian, along with the ability to find work online via sites like ours, make it possible to work anywhere. The number of U.S. freelancers [自由职业者] who found projects online increased 22 points in the past five years - from 42 percent in 2014 to 64 percent in 2018.

The most talented professionals are increasingly used to being able to call the shots [做主] and shape their lives [塑造自己的生活] as they want to live them rather than as traditional 9-to-5 work requires. This means companies who want access to them need to allow remote work.
