# 1.in which / where 
> 1)"In which" is quite commonly used in formal writing. You can use it in daily speech.""Which" is often used in a sentence to introduce a new clause. In other words, it combines clauses together to make complete sentences. From our dialogue, we know that Boomers created a certain reality. In that reality, it's difficult to make certain choices. We use "in which" instead of "to which," "at which" or "on which" because the preposition most commonly used with reality is "in."

> 2)but it's more common to use "where." Just keep in mind that "where" isn't as precise as using a preposition and "which."

***Eddie, what is this "OK, boomer" meme all about?***

***Well, it's basically the culmination of my generation's frustration with the Baby Boomers.***

***In what sense? Is this just a generation gap thing?***

***No. They have always been so oblivious to our situation. This is the perfect retort to their condescension.***

***I'm not sure I follow***

***They say we're entitled and judge our choices. But it was their choices that created the bleak socioeconomic reality in which we can't even make those so-called "right choices."***

***Well, one example: many boomers went to college for free, but then they built a college loan industry that made it totally unaffordable for us.***

***Ok, I got you. Sounds like a catch-22 to me.***

***I'm not sure it's a perfect catch-22, but it's definitely ironic!***

***So why is it "OK, boomer" and not "whatever, boomer"?***

***I think because "whatever" is too heavy with sarcasm. "OK" is more dismissive by stealth.***
