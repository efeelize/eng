# generation's frustration
# I.What "OK boomer" is really about
> Teens understand that the "OK, boomer" meme is driven [内在驱动] both by their generation's deep economic and environmental anxiety [这一代人对经济和环境深深的焦虑], and by progressive values [进步性价值观] that are growing firmer over time [随着时间的推移越来越坚定]. Younger generations are more diverse, less religious, and more directly impacted by economic inequality [经济不平等] than their forebears /'fɔrbɛr/ [n.祖先,祖宗].

> "Ok, Boomer, millennials actually earn 20 percent less than you did," GQ declared in mid-November [GQ杂志在11月中旬]. Millennials who value work culture [重视工作文化], advancement possibilities [晋升机会], and quality of work over quantity [重视工作质量] are finding their paths to promotions blocked by baby boomers [被婴儿潮一代所阻碍] — but when they change jobs or careers in search of these things [追寻这些], they find themselves branded with the false stereotype of being disloyal job-hoppers [打上了不忠诚的跳槽者这一错误的刻板印象].

> All the while [一直以来], student debt remains high, and the economic scandals [经济丑闻] of the 2000s have led to millennials being more cynical /'sɪnɪkl/ [adj.愤世嫉俗的] than their elders about the benevolence /bə'nɛvələns/ [n.仁慈,善心,善意] of corporate overlords /'ovɚlɔrd/ [企业霸主].[本世纪初的经济丑闻使得千禧一代比老一辈对待企业霸主的仁慈更加抱有讽刺态度]

> But many of those offended by "OK boomer" seem to understand very little of this. They're instead sticking to their guns about the workplace [他们在工作场所坚持己见], at least according to the teens who don't trust them. "I feel as if they aren’t changing with the times," Lepera told Vox News. "They believe that how they did everything when they were younger, we should do as well."[我觉得他们好像没有随着时代的变化而改变。他们认为，我们应该沿用他们年轻时的做事方式。]

# II.grammar
# 1.in/at/on/to  which & where 
> 1)"In which" is quite commonly used in formal writing. You can use it in daily speech.""Which" is often used in a sentence to introduce a new clause. In other words, it combines clauses together to make complete sentences. From our dialogue, we know that Boomers created a certain reality. In that reality, it's difficult to make certain choices. We use "in which" instead of "to which," "at which" or "on which" because the preposition most commonly used with reality is "in."

> 2)but it's more common to use "where." Just keep in mind that "where" isn't as precise as using a preposition and "which."

- 1. Describe for us a situation in which you had to rely on principles to make a decision.

- 2. This was a theory in which most educated people once believed.

- 3. Digestion is a process in which our bodies break down food for energy.[分解食物以获取能量]

# 2.meme /mi:m/ （互联网上传播的）表情包；段子；梗 
> so a meme usually refers to an internet meme, and this is an image or video that spreads really quickly around the internet. it's a picture or a video with some text, some words on it that are usually supposed to be funny or making fun of somebody.and we have a lot of movie memes. For example, there's a lot of memes from The Avengers or Baby Yoda from Star Wars. that's a real popular one, Baby Yoda. Because he's so cute, so usually people have a picture of Baby Yoda with some funny words on the bottom and yes, they're very funny.

# 3.the culmination of /ˌkʌlməˈneɪʃən/ [n.顶点；高潮] & culminate in /'kʌlmɪnet/ [v.到绝顶；达到高潮；达到顶点 ]
> 1)culmination: with the noun, we usually say "the culmination of."When a lot of events add up over a long time to some point at the end, that point at the end is the culmination, it's adding up.

> 2)The verb is "culminate."so "culminate in," so that's the preposition after the verb for example, if you're in a relationship, maybe two of you make little mistakes, but these little mistakes culminate into a big fight.

# 4.oblivious /əˈblɪviəs/ [毫无察觉的] 
> “Oblivious" means that you are unaware of something, and usually when that something is happening around you.if you are, like, oblivious to your partner's concerns, maybe they're worried or feeling anxious, and you don't even see that. You don't notice or realize that. with the boomers, they're often oblivious to the problems that a lot of the younger generations face. They think that our situation, our current problems have been created by us. They think that we are just not working hard enough.

- 1. I must admit I'm pretty oblivious about the art world.[毫不关心]

- 2. She's trying to reach out to you! Could you be any more oblivious?[毫不在意]

- 3. We were all oblivious to [未察觉] the dire consequences of our foolish actions.

# 5.retort /rɪˈtɔːrt/ [反驳，回嘴] 
> a retort is a reply or answer, but it's usually an argumentative one. You're trying to make a point by saying this.So "retort" always seems to have like a bit of like anger perhaps behind it. And "OK, boomer" is the perfect retort to their condescension.

# 6.condescension /ˌkɑːnˈdəsenʃən/ [傲慢态度] & condescending to sb /ˌkɑndɪˈsɛndɪŋ/ [adj.轻蔑的；表现出优越感的；居高临下的] & be dismissive /dɪs'mɪsɪv/ of sb’s opinion [不屑一顾的] 
> 1)Condescension. 

> 2)And the adjective of this is "condescending," you can be condesc.ending to somebody. This means basically that you think you're smarter or better than other people. you're looking down on them,  for example, a senior employee could be condescending to someone who just started or is new.maybe they have a condescending attitude. If you're the new staff or the younger staff member, then you can say, "Hey, I don't appreciate your condescending attitude."

> 3)so "dismissive" is just when you ignore something.so you could be dismissive of someone's opinion. So you think, "Eh, not important, right? It's not gonna work."

# 7.entitled /ɪnˈtaɪtəld/ [任性的；被宠坏的] 
> 1)entitled. It means that we think we should get everything.So for example, a spoiled child is entitled. You keep giving them toys and money, and suddenly they think that they should always get these things. And that maybe they don't have to say "please" or "thank you."this feeling that you deserve everything. I deserve this. I deserve that. may the boomers didn't have it that way. They didn't deserve anything. 

> 2)They worked hard for what they have for their success.So then they feel that some of us younger people might feel a little bit entitled because maybe we didn't have to work quite as hard when we were young.We've talked about this being a negative thing, but it's also just a neutral word when we talk about things that you actually deserve. when we talk about legal things, you could be entitled to something. or for example, if you worked at a company for many years, then you're entitled to a raise.

- 1. Each and every one of us is all entitled to fair treatment under the law.[有权得到公平对待]

- 2. I'm tired of my millennial [千禧一代的] daughter's entitled attitudes [任性的态度].

- 3. Even though you are completely wrong, you are entitled to [有权] your opinion.

# 8.bleak /bliːk/ [惨淡的] & bleak prospects /bliːk ˈprɑːspekts/ [暗淡的前景]
> the word "bleak," which means depressing or not much hope.you can use it in almost any situation like, if there are bleak prospects to your investment, that means there's not much hope.and we usually use it when we're talking about the future like a bleak future, you think that things will just go downhill. They're not going to get better.you can say things are looking pretty bleak.

# 9.baby boomer [（尤指1945至1965年间）婴儿潮一代 ] &  OK,boomer
> a boomer born after World War II, so those are people getting old and retiring now. "OK" here, it's kind of like saying "whatever" in a sarcastic way. It's sort of like, "Oh, I don't have to listen to you" or "Whatever, boomer."like "Okay, mom!" It has that same attitude. "OK, boomer, I don't really agree with what you're saying."

# 10.catch-22 [进退两难的局面] 
> a catch-22 is a situation or problem that you can't solve or escape. This is because the solution is actually part of the problem. for example, you need experience to get a job, but you need a job to get experience. That's a catch-22. that's the most common example of a catch-22 and it's a problem for a lot of people, like employers won't hire you because you don't have experience.how do you get the experience in the first place? You need A to do B, but you need B to do A.

# 11.generational tension [代际紧张]

# 12.ironic /aɪˈrɑːnɪk/ [adj.讽刺的] & irony [n.] & sarcasm /ˈsɑːrkæzəm/ [n.讥讽]
> 1)"ironic" is an adjective,So in this situation, it's a little bit ironic that the people who received education for free or nearly for free would create this system that forces younger people to pay high fees for their education.If a fire station burns down in a fire, that's ironic."Ironic" is just talking about a situation that could happen or did happen. 

> 2)The noun form is "irony," so the pronunciation changes a little bit. It's when something is funny because it's the opposite of what you expected.

- 1. Most of my favorite authors have a pretty ironic sense of humor.

- 2. Don't you find it a little ironic that the banks don't know how to handle their money?

- 3. The final act of the play was riddled with [充满了] layers upon layers of irony [多重的讽刺].

> 3) "sarcasm" is just making fun of people, making jokes.it is when you say the opposite of what you mean and you use it to criticize or make fun of someone. this is so common like in all cultures and languages, especially with your friends. maybe your friend or coworker is playing video games or watching cat videos at work, And you can say, "Well, I see you have been working really hard." Like that is sarcastic. If your friend orders a really huge coffee, it's like so big, you could say to your friend, "Are you sure you don't want a bigger one? It looks a little small."

# 13.sociology /,sosɪ'ɑlədʒi/ [社会学；群体生态学] & socioeconomic /ˌsoʊsioʊˌiːkəˈnɑːmɪk/ [社会经济的]
> "socioeconomic" means a mixture of social and economic factors. We often say socioeconomic problems. Now, after this, we see our grammar point here, "in which." So the bleak socioeconomic reality in which we can't even make those so-called "right choices."

# III.pattern
***Eddie, what is this "OK, boomer" meme all about?***

***Well, it's basically the culmination of my generation's frustration with the Baby Boomers.***

***In what sense? Is this just a generation gap thing?***

***No. They have always been so oblivious to our situation. This is the perfect retort to their condescension.***

***I'm not sure I follow***

***They say we're entitled and judge our choices. But it was their choices that created the bleak socioeconomic reality in which we can't even make those so-called "right choices."***

***Well, one example: many boomers went to college for free, but then they built a college loan industry that made it totally unaffordable for us.***

***Ok, I got you. Sounds like a catch-22 to me.***

***I'm not sure it's a perfect catch-22, but it's definitely ironic!***

***So why is it "OK, boomer" and not "whatever, boomer"?***

***I think because "whatever" is too heavy with sarcasm. "OK" is more dismissive by stealth.***
