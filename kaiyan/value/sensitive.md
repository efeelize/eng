# III.pattern
***Hey Carey, can I talk to you? It feels like my new coworkers don't appreciate me.***

***Really? Are you sure you're not being overly sensitive?***

***I am a sensitive person, but they just seem terse and unfriendly, so I'm terrified of screwing up.***

***It could be that you're reading negative intentions into their behavior and overanalyzing it?***

***Probably. I wish I were thicker-skinned, but people really seem to affect me.***

***That's what sensitivity is. Your brain is more in tune with sensory input, so you perceive experiences,whether positive or negative, more deeply.***

***So that's why I get so agitated. How can I control all the stimulation?***

***You just ignore it. It's usually not about you anyway, so there's no point in agonizing about it.***

***I guess I should pause and refocus on how to improve, and the strengths I get from being sensitive.***

***Absolutely! Sensitivity is hugely advantageous with things like empathy and intuition.***

***Thanks. I feel better already.***
