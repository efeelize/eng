# I.Paper books are coming back
> Despite the move from print to digital books, new data show that the public is ditching /dɪtʃ/ [v.甩开] e-books and returning to the old fashioned printed word, according to CNN. Sales of consumer e-books in the USA dropped 18.7%, while sales of paperback books rose by 7.5%, and hardback/'hɑrd'bæk/ [n.精装本] books by 4.1%.

> One of the reasons could be that some genres /'ʒɑnrə/ [n.类型] are better suited to print[某些类型的书籍更适合印刷], such as children’s books and recipe books. According to Pew Research, 65% of Americans reported reading a printed book in the past year, while only 28% read an e-book. Digital material is still widely replacing print material, but the physical experience of touching a book seems to be holding on.[但触摸书本的实际体验似乎仍在继续升温]

# II.grammar
# 1.more of a something person
> The expression “more of a sth person” is used when contrasting with another person’s likes, dislikes or views. It’s often used when talking about film, book or music genres, as well as food, or even preferred pets.

- 1. Oh, you like biographies. I’m more of a fantasy [虚构文学] person. 

- 2. I do like cats, but I’m more of a dog person. 

- 3. Sometimes I enjoy coffee, but I’m more of a tea person.

# 2.paperback [n.简装纸质书] & softcover & hardcover 
> 1)So paperback, you guys can probably imagine a paperback book is a book with a soft cover.You can also say "softcover". I grew up saying paperback. It's just, it's, it's not hard. It's, it's soft, you can bend it. So the paperback books are kind of soft and light and bendy and these are not like the hardcover books.

> 2) hardcover books. Those are bigger and they're more expensive.Actually I like the hardcover books, but I just never want to carry them around.

# 3.memoris /'memwɑ:/ [n.回忆录]
> 1) just be careful of the pronunciation. It's spelled m-e-m-o-i-r-s. But it's a French word actually. So we say /'mɛmwɑr/.

> 2) And memoirs, you can kind of think about it as being related to memories. And so it's about kind of personal knowledge about maybe your life experience.It's biographical. So it, it's about somebody's life, but it's not really a thoroughly researched. It's just kind of yeah, like you said memories, and it it maybe, it's not the full life, just parts of the life. And so memoirs can sometimes not be so entertaining, or interesting, or riveting. They may be a struggle to finish.

# 4.self-help [adj.自我帮助、自我安慰] & for Dummies [phr.新手教学]
> 1)So self-help, this... The first self-help book, I think like 80 years ago. And it's for helping yourself, by yourself, So it's about improving yourself. It could be about your quality of life, your health often. Or even about improving your Finances.

> 2)for Dummies. Dummies kind of means maybe someone who is not that intelligent.a dummy is an idiot. It's funny because these books came out. This, for Dummies, series of books. It's a big company now. So it's kind of funny. It's like if you don't know anything about finance, you can buy Finance for Dummies.You could also find a book, let's say, for, cooking for Dummies.They have absolutely everything, you could learn Spanish, for French for Dummies. If you see somebody carrying a yellow book, they are always yellow. And it's become a huge company now. They're all for Dummies. So any subject at all, for Dummies. So these are foolproof, meaning, anyone can learn them.That's right. And even if you have one, you're not an idiot. It's kind of a joke. I'm not a dummy. But I have this book because I want to learn.So don't be embarrassed about buying one.

# 5.fiction [n] & fictitious [adj.] & sci-fi [n.科幻] & non-fiction [n.非虚构、纪实类] & biography [n.他人代写的传记] & bestseller [n.畅销书]
> 1)So fiction is basically something that is imagined. It's not real.

> 2)The adjective form of this is "fictitious". So if somebody says something fictitious, it's a lie, it's not true.So maybe you told your boss a fictitious story about why you're late this morning.

> 3)Sci-fi. So be careful of the pronunciation of this. We don't really say "s-f". We always say "sci-fi" or ''science fiction''.

> 4)So this is the opposite of fiction. Non-fiction means truth.So non-fiction books include things like biographies, memoirs and self-help books.

> 5)So bio-, you can kind of think about this as being related to kind of life and biology. And graphy actually means writing.Exactly, the original language. So biography is a story about a person's life.if somebody wrote their own story about their own life, we call that an autobiography.So auto just means self here.

> 6)On the bestseller list. Now, you can see this, it's, it's a compound word, it's bestseller. So it sells a lot of books. It's like in the top 10 in the charts. Or maybe not, maybe not just top 10. It could be the top 5.So but these are the ones you frequently see in the newspapers and on the news.

# 6 put it down [phr.放下] & e-reader [n.电子阅读器] & tore through [phr,读完、啃完] & single sitting & riveting  /'rɪvɪtɪŋ/  [adj.吸引人的] & page turners [phr,引人入胜的书，一页接着一页看]
> 1)It's a little bit exaggerated, but it just shows that you are really really interested in this. It's so much fun that you can't put it down. You just gotta keep using it. It's addictive.So you've got to finish it, maybe in one setting.

> 2)e-reader is an electronic device for reading. In other words, it is a reading tablet. So it's like an iPad, but it's only for reading. And the screen is actually, it's a different kind of screen.So it's usually kind of a black and white screen or kind of grey, I should say.And the battery lasts for a very long time.

> 3)So "tore through" here, you can kind of thinking of just ripping right through something very quickly. So and that's what it means, to read something very quickly.It's like the pages are tearing, you tore, tearing through it. So we can use this for things other than reading as well. So for example, I could say, "I tore through the forest."On a bicycle.

> 4)It also could be a negative thing. Like if a fire tore through a house, it, it just moves quickly through the house, on fire.

> 5)So a single sitting, you can kind of think about this as maybe one day.like one day. I think of it just like you sit down one time and you don't stand up until you've finished.So you guys might be able to relate to this, let's say when you're on the airplane.Yeah. It's a single sitting, one session. And some people can read a book like in two hours, I can't.

> 6)It just means extremely interesting.You can also think about it as being something that's very exciting.

> 7)So a page turner is one of those riveting books where you keep turning the pages.A page turner. It's like my hand is automatically like a robot turning the page every time. It's a page turner.
