# 1.prepare your day the night before
> Take the evening to prepare for tomorrow. Pack your bag, make your lunch, and check your calendar for meetings. It gives so much calm to your evenings, knowing that everything is ready for tomorrow.

# 2.use a timer to increase productivity
> Creating a feeling of scarcity helps with productivity and reaching your goals. Set a timer for each task and complete it within that time frame. Productivity techniques like the Pomodoro timer are popular, where you work for 25 minutes and have a 5-minute break.

# 3.write down your thoughts
> When you feel like you have many things on your mind, write it down. It will take your thoughts from your head to the paper. A great moment to write down your thoughts is right before you go to bed. Empty your mind with everything that comes up, and you will have a good night's sleep.

Installing certain apps or having a time limit is a great start.

# II.grammar
# 1.such being the case
> "Such being the case" is a formal phrase that means "since this is the case" or "under these circumstances."Here "such" is a pronoun that refers to a previous statement.

> In today's lesson, the speaker says, "Such being the case, he argues we should focus less on goals and more on the actual systems that will put us on the right trajectory." Here "Such being the case" refers to Clear's philosophy that incremental changes compound over time to have massive effects. And, since he believes this to be the case, he argues we should focus more on those systems that can help us make those incremental changes.

> Often this phrase is used to express why a certain decision or action was made. For instance, "There was an overwhelming number of complaints about the product. Such being the case, they decided to suspend the
project until they come up with a viable solution."

# III.pattern
***In order to make big changes, first you have to think small, says habit expert James Clear.***

***His critically acclaimed book, Atomic Habits, is a guide to developing a sustainable system that will put you on the path to success.***

***His core philosophy is that incremental changes compound over time and have massive effects.***

***Such being the case, he argues we should focus less on goals and more on the actual systems that will put us on the right trajectory.***

***He's boiled his advice down to 4 actionable steps:***

***Step 1: Make it obvious. If you make habit cues more noticeable, it'll be easier to prompt and maintain the habit.***

***Step 2: Make it attractive. Bundling new habits with actions we want to do can make new actions more enticing.***

***For step 3: Make it easy and step 4: Make it satisfying, we can reduce friction and use immediate rewards to reinforce behavior.***

***With these easy steps, Clear argues that anyone can adopt habits and achieve long-term success.***

# III.pattern
***Many of us make New Year's resolutions but very few of us keep them.Achieving our goals isn't just about willpower. It's about developing the right skills and strategies that, with patience, will lead to success.***

***Here are some practical tips that will help you increase your chances of that success, be it with learning English or with other things in life:***

***1. Clearly define your goals:Many people like to make grand statements such as, "This is the year I'm going to finally..." but these goals are often too general and vague.Instead, set SMART goals for yourself: goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timebound.***

***2. Track your progress:If you can measure it, you can change it. These measurements will help motivate you.They will also help you to identify plateaus or "sticking points" in your progress so you can adjust your efforts.***

***3. Have patience:Progress is never linear. Some people will see changes right away but hit resistance later in their efforts.For others, initial progress may be painfully slow but then they suddenly achieve rapid breakthroughs.***

***4. Publicize your goals to friends and family;Yes, it takes some personal courage to share something that you might actually fail at, but friends and family will also help hold you accountable and give you support.***

***5. Put it on your schedule:"I just can't find the time" is simply an excuse. We all choose to spend our time the way we do - whether it's eating junk food or going to the gym.Make your new goals a priority by actually scheduling them into your calendar.Think of these time blocks as important appointments. Don't easily skip them or schedule something else over them.***

***6. Get up when you slip up:Resilience is the key. Don't turn relapses or temporary failures into excuses for giving up.Instead, acknowledge the mistake and recommit to the path.***
