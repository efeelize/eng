# I.four atomic habits that will change your life
# 1.prepare your day the night before
> Take the evening to prepare for tomorrow. Pack your bag, make your lunch, and check your calendar for meetings. It gives so much calm to your evenings, knowing that everything is ready for tomorrow.

# 2.use a timer to increase productivity
> Creating a feeling of scarcity helps with productivity and reaching your goals. Set a timer for each task and complete it within that time frame. Productivity techniques like the Pomodoro timer are popular, where you work for 25 minutes and have a 5-minute break.

# 3.write down your thoughts
> When you feel like you have many things on your mind, write it down. It will take your thoughts from your head to the paper. A great moment to write down your thoughts is right before you go to bed. Empty your mind with everything that comes up, and you will have a good night's sleep.

# 4.put your phone away
> Train yourself to be on your phone less during the day. Using your phone has a significant impact on your productivity. When you stop working on the task at hand, it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to get back on track. There are many ways to stop your phone addiction. Installing certain apps or having a time limit is a great start.

# II.grammar
# 1.such being the case
> "Such being the case" is a formal phrase that means "since this is the case" or "under these circumstances."Here "such" is a pronoun that refers to a previous statement.

> In today's lesson, the speaker says, "Such being the case, he argues we should focus less on goals and more on the actual systems that will put us on the right trajectory." Here "Such being the case" refers to Clear's philosophy that incremental changes compound over time to have massive effects. And, since he believes this to be the case, he argues we should focus more on those systems that can help us make those incremental changes.

> Often this phrase is used to express why a certain decision or action was made. For instance, "There was an overwhelming number of complaints about the product. Such being the case, they decided to suspend the
project until they come up with a viable solution."
