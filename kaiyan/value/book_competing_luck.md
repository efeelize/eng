***Two decades ago, Clayton Christensen revolutionized business with his theory of disruptive innovation.***

***Now he's back with more insights on predictive growth in his best-selling book Competing against Luck.***

***All too often, companies think luck ultimately determines whether a product sinks or floats.***

***But in truth, he contends, gaining traction has more to do with reframing our approach to innovation.***

***His theory is that consumers hire a product to fulfill a job, and by pinpointing those jobs, we can understand the causal mechanisms behind customer behavior — the true driver of innovation.***

***He recommends 3 easy steps to help us harness this knowledge and transform our success:***

***1. Find a job that needs to be done. Dig deep and pinpoint the functional and emotional reasons behind hiring a product.***

***2. Document the journey. Analyze the situation and experience of the purchase to hone in on the friction.***

***3. Remove the obstacles and remedy the frustration. New innovations have to be "twice as good" to convince customers to switch.***
