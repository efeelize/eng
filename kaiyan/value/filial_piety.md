# Sandwich Generation
# I.Things You Need to Know About the Sandwich Generation
> Tens of millions of Americans today are known as the Sandwich Generation -- sandwiched between caring for both their children and aging relatives [长辈], typically their parents. They are generally in their 40s and 50s, with most working full time [全职工作] while trying to meet the demands of being a care giver.

> With more people living longer than ever before and old-age dependency/dɪ'pɛndənsi/ [n.属国, 附庸国] ratios increasing across the globe, the Sandwich Generation is going to continue to grow.Here are things you need to know about the Sandwich Generation.

# 1.The Sandwich Generation is Growing
> A Pew Research Center [皮尤研究中心] study found almost half of all adults in their 40s and 50s have at least one parent age 65 or older [至少有一个65岁以上或更老的父亲或者母亲], while also raising a young child or helping to financially support a child age 18 or older. The Sandwich Population is growing, as the number of people over the age of 65 is set to double [翻一番] over the next 25 years. 

# 2.Being Sandwiched Impacts Work and Wallets 
> The Pew Research study also found one in seven middle-aged adults [七分之一的成年人] provides financial support to both a child and their aging parent [年迈的父母]. FWI’s 2014 study notes two-thirds of caregivers [养育责任] are employed while providing elder care, and more than 1 in 4 caregivers count on their employers to be flexible in order to allow them to balance caregiving and work responsibilities.

# 3.Women Are Heavily Affected
> While this generation has no gender bias - both men and women are impacted - it’s women who are more heavily affected by caring for both an aging parent and raising their family, according to the Family Wealth Advisors Council of Women [关于美国压力的调查显示] in Wealth “Wow Study.” The study revealed the aging population and elder care needs are the most “significant challenge” women will face in the coming years. The American Psychological Association’s 2007 Stress in America Survey shows Sandwich Generation mothers feel more stress than any other age group, while trying to balance caring for both their children and aging parents.

# II.grammar
# 1.using sandwhich
## 1)the compliment sandwich [三明治评价法]
> This is what we use when we need to criticize someone, but we want to do it in such a way so as not to hurt them. Think of the “meat” of the sandwich as the criticism, and the bread as compliments [把三明治里夹的“肉”想象成批评，将面包当作恭维] that will make the criticism seem less harsh.

## 2)take a bite of the reality sandwhich [咬一口现实的三明治]
> This is where you need to be more realistic [更加现实] and recognize certain flaws [某个“三明治”（问题）的不足] regarding a particular sandwich. “Reality” in this case can be substituted with other nouns.

## 3)a knuckle sandwhich [迎面一拳]
> To give someone a knuckle sandwich means to punch them, usually in the face.

## 4)a few sandwhiches shy/short of a picnic [呆头呆脑] & a few bricks shy of a load
> This is a great phrase that follows the pattern of “a few... shy of a...”, which basically means stupid.

- 1. I always use a compliment sandwich when I’m giving criticism of my employees’work.

- 2. If he comes around here again, I’m gonna give him a knuckle sandwich.

- 3. You really need to take a bite of the reality sandwich if you think this is going to solve all of our financial problems.

## 5)sandwhich generation [n.上有老、下有小的一代] & sandwhicher 
> 1)the sandwich generation is that generation that is called in between, and a sandwicher is just a person who's calling in between.

> 2)we're just adding the "er" on to the end of a word. We do this all the time. Um, Beijinger. you're a Hong Konger.

## 6)club sandwich [n.双层三明治]
> it’s turkey and bacon,it’s really tasty.Speak of sandwich, it's pretty popular sandwich. It will be in every restaurant, but most restaurants will have a club sandwich.

>2) the big thing here is that it's a good thing, So he's putting a positive spin /spɪn/ [v.旋转] on this word.you want to be in a club, Everyone wants to feel together as a part of a bigger group. I guess it probably would make more sense if you said "sandwich club", but then they wouldn't be a club sandwich.

# 2.daycare [n.日托] & preschool [学前班]
> so daycare is the place where you take your children when you have to work.It's not school, it's not after school, it's completely different, uh, than school.so usually these kids are around two or three years old, you know they're too young to be going to school. one of the reasons why someone would need to have some daycare recommendations, it's because they are probably pretty busy. they're probably working.

# 3.retirement home [n.养老院] & the old folks home & community
> 1)so retirement home is a really nice sounding place, for maybe a not always so nice place.it's basically a place where elderly people to be taken care of.But usually when they go into these homes, it's long after they've retired, So it's kind of a funny name.it's definitely a euphemism /'jufəmɪzəm/ [n.委婉语;委婉说法] , it's meant to sound nice, Usually these people are around, I don't know seventy eighty years old.But the reason why they are putting them in a retirement home is often because they don't have time to take care of them

> 2) And actually I always use another word "the old folks home" as a threat to my parents, like, "You'd better be nice to me, or I'm going to put you into the bad home."

> 3)There is another, also very euphemistic [adj.adj. 委婉的] way we can talk about, and this is kind of a newer form of a retirement home. This is a community.so it's a little bit larger. Often there are several buildings kind of joining together. the idea is that it allows the residents, a little bit more freedom, a little bit more independence.and often there's like a garden or a lot of different common spaces that they can meet in,They can meet, they can dance, they can talk about their grandkids. Now of course, these places, believe it or not, don't really come cheap.they're usually pretty expensive. 

# 4. a one-child policy [n.独生子女计划] & burden & feel the weight [phr.感到压力]
> 1)a one-child policy. But the results of it is that there is a burden.you have to take care of your parents and you have to take care of your kid or maybe kids. Now at this point, and you really have to do it kind of on your own.

> 2)So this burden right is something heavy that you have to take care of. we have a lot of different types of burdens, for example, financial burdens, You maybe have to pay a lot of money for something. Or even like emotional burdens, maybe you've heard someone's story and you have to deal with his pain.you could say you're really feeling the burden here. You're really feeling the effect of this.

> 3)we could probably almost just switch those two phrases, The One-child Policy makes people feel the weight. so definitely you can interchange those things.  Sometimes you might also hear people say feel the gravity of something.gravity is good, because obviously if there were no gravity we would have no weight.

> 4)another example of this would be when someone makes the decision to quit their job and maybe start a new career, maybe they will feel the weight of this decision, right? They feel that stress.

- 1. Her mother’s disease left her with both a huge financial burden and a crippling emotional one as well.

- 2. When many soldiers return from war, they carry with them burdens that civilians can’t understand.

- 3. Our plan is to simplify the tax code [简化税规] to make it less burdensome for middle class families.

# 5.dead-set against [phr.坚决反对] & filial /'fɪlɪəl/ piety /ˈpaɪəti/ [n.孝道] & pious /'paɪəs/ 虔诚的
> 1)That means that they'll be really, really against that.super opposed to. "No, you can't do that".Well I guess a lot of people are dead-set against immigrants coming to their country as well.

> 2)filial piety: I think a lot of parents are afraid of their children leaving,Because also they want their children to take care of them, It's about that like filial piety. And it just means, kind of like devotion to your parents.

> 3) "piety",we used it a lot, that kind of means more like devoted to God.but in this situation because of filial, filial means like kind of from the child.it would mean obligation or duty to your parents.

> 4)so the whole problem with a culture that is so centered,around this idea of filial piety is this idea doesn't really square very well with the idea of a western retirement home.it doesn't really match or correspond.

# 6.sth doesn’t square with sth
> if something doesn't square with it, it just doesn't line up, it doesn't match.So when something doesn't square with something else, it's not quite right. so maybe you are making an excuse to someone, But your story doesn't square with the facts.

# 7.don't come + adjective & don’t come cheap [不便宜] & financial windfall /ˈwɪndˌfɔl/ [意外之财]
> it just means that you can't get these things cheap. you can't find, it doesn't exist.and you could change the adjective, for example, I could say that winning doesn't come easy.or success doesn't come easy.or most things don't come free.

- 1. winning doesn't come easy.

- 2.success doesn't come easy.

- 3.most things don't come free.

# 8.downsized [v.从大房子换到小房子]
> 1)"Downsizing", it is what it sounds like. It basically means that you reduce the size of your home.there was a movie where they are like shrunk people to make them smaller, the idea was that we take up too much space, use too many resources, so if we can shrink ourselves down to very very very very small, then we won't use as many resources. and when you downsize, you usually save money.

> 2)And that's why companies love to do it. Companies also downsize, but when they do it, they are not really moving to a smaller home, they're basically just firing people. but usually we say "laid off" in that situation.

> 3)one of the reasons why people have to downsize is because of deteriorating health, right? So maybe you can't have that two-floor house anymore, you need that apartment. Because you can't go up and down those stairs.grandma's legs ain't what they used to be.

- 1. We’re trying to convince our parents to downsize to a smaller house, but dad is putting up a fight.

- 2.I’m a little worried about my husband’s job amidst all these rumors of the company downsizing.

- 3.She was pretty fortunate to have downsized at the top of the housing market.

# 9.deteriorating /dɪ'tɪrɪəret/ [v.恶化]
> we always use it for health,we could also use it for relationships, for political situations.frequently business partnerships.you could say that before they they split. There was the conditions between them were deteriorating. In any case, Scott here should not feel down.Even though he's facing all this pressure, even though his mom's health is deteriorating, even though he can't find a daycare spot for his daughter. He should know that he is not alone.

- 1. His health has been deteriorating steadily for years, but he refuses to do anything about it.

- 2. According to our top diplomats, the stability of the region is quickly deteriorating.

- 3.Our relationship began to deteriorate when I found out that he was not being faithful to me.

# 10.cohort /'kohɔrt/ [n.同类人群]
> 1)Cohort is basically a group of people that are kind of band together under similar conditions are believed.so usually "cohorts" are used at school. 

> 2)Actually "cohorts" can be really used anywhere, right? So for example, you could have it like at work or maybe you could have it like " a cohort of business people", like "a cohort of startups". Ok, but it's Barb here that says that like this cohort has to stick together, right? And what does Scots say and response to these?

# III.pattern
***Hey Barb, do you have any daycare recommendations? We have to find a new one for my daughter soon***

***Oh, well actually my parents look after the kids while my husband and I are at work.***

***I wish that were an option for me. Not only do I have to find a new daycare for my daughter, but I have to find a new retirement home for my mom, too.***

***Oh wow, looks like we’ve got another sandwicher!***

***You know, the sandwich generation. Those of us sandwiched between having to take care of both our parents and our kids.***

***Well I’ve got a younger sister who does what she can, but I guess with the whole one-child policy the burden for you must be huge.***

***Well I’d be lying if I said we didn’t feel the weight of the situation. Plus, my parents are completely dead-set against retirement homes. They don’t easily square with our idea of filial piety.***

***I bet they don’t come cheap.***

***Fortunately when my mom downsized a few years ago, we were able to put away a few bucks, so that pretty much covers the cost.***

***Did your mom help you take care of your children? I heard American grandparents don’t really do that.***

***They are generally not as involved as Chinese grandparents, but many still help out. My mom offered to help too, but with her deteriorating health, there wasn’t much she could really do.***

***Well it’s good to know I’m not alone. With all of this pressure we face, this cohort has to stick together.***

***You mean like a club sandwich?***

***Something like that.***
