# I.Maotai:from status symbol to the most value firm
> Moutai baijiu is a clear, potent spirit that's been dubbed "firewater," thanks to the fact that it's 53% alcohol. The red-and-white bottles of its flagship product, "Feitian," or "Flying Fairy," are a staple at Chinese state banquets and business events. Known as the "drink of diplomacy," it was famously used to welcome former US President Richard Nixon on his historic trip to China in 1972. Being part of so many major public events in China really set the brand in the national consciousness.

> Today, the brand is seen more as a luxury status symbol. Some customers buy it not to drink, but to keep as investments. Moutai has long been seen as one of China's blue-chip stocks. In 2019, Moutai also became the first Chinese company since 2005 to see its share price hit 1,000 yuan (about $145), notching another market record. And last year, it became the most valuable non-tech company in China.

> Moutai has an outsize reliance on the Chinese market. To be sure, the company has tried to push overseas, notably by starting a "fan club" in the United States, traveling to Africa to woo new business partners and teaming up with foreign players, such as Italy's Inter Milan soccer club.

***Hey Billy, so I drank Maotai for the first time last night. It has a really distinct flavor!***

***That's thanks to the particular climate of the region in Guizhou Province where it's made.***

***I heard it's the fermented red sorghum that makes Maotai such a savory liquor.***

***Yes, that and the special distillation and aging processes which are used to produce it.***

***I also heard that Maotai's production dates back thousands of years to the Han Dynasty.***

***That's right. But it wasn't until 1951 when it officially became China's national liquor.***

***By that time it was already being produced by the state-owned company that makes it now?***

***Yep. And Maotai is actually the first Chinese liquor to be made in large-scale production.***

***Seems it's since been branded as a premium product, which is drunk on state official occasions.***

***Well, having a limited supply makes Maotai so coveted and pushes its stock prices sky-high!***
