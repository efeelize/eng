# I.takeaways from robert iger's the ride of a lifetime
> Iger describes the book as not so much a memoir as an effort to share the knowledge and leadership skills.He also explains the reasoning behind his famous regimen of waking at 4:15 a.m. to exercise and start his day. In part, it's to give his brain a little goof-off time before the daily deluge begins.

> It's vital to create space in each day to let your thoughts wander beyond your immediate job responsibilities," Iger writes.Here are some takeaways of particular interest to industryites from The Ride of a Lifetime:

> 1. In January 2006, former Disney CEO Michael Eisner made his case to the Disney board of directors why they should not support Iger's bid to buy Pixar for $7.4 billion. The move offended Iger. But he notes that Eisner later acknowledged he was wrong. "Which was gracious of him," Iger writes.

> 2. In the summer of 2016, Disney came close to buying Twitter. Iger saw it as a distribution platform with global reach. The Disney board gave Iger the OK to finalize a deal, but he soon got cold feet after considering the problems that Disney would inherit in addressing hate speech and fake accounts.

# 1.leads to
> You could put each "leads to" statement into its own sentence. You can see this from Master Yoda in Star Wars: "Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."

> But sometimes it can be just as powerful to connect them all with the conjunction "which," as Bob Iger has done.

> "Leads to" isn't the only verb you can use in this situation You could use a stronger word like "A, which causes B, which causes C." Or you could use a weaker word like "A influences B, which influences C."
