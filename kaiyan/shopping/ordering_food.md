# II.情态动词
> Modals for suggestion may include can, could, may, might, must, will, would, and should.A few rule of using modals: 

- Modals are helping verbs [情态动词有助动词的作用]

- Used with the base form of the verb, modals create verbal phrases. [动词使用其原形，情态动词组成动词短语]

- Modals do not change form. [情态动词形态固定]

- Modals never end in “s”, even in 3rd person singular.[情态动词即使在"三单一"的情况下结尾也不加“s”]

- Use “not” to make modal verbs negative. [用“not”表示情态动词否定式]

- Don’t use double modals. [不要同时使用两个情态动词]

- Modals lack past tense forms, except ‘could’ and ‘would’ which serve as the past of ‘can’ and ‘will’.[情态动词没有过去式，除了‘could’和‘would’分别是‘can’和‘will’的过去式。]
