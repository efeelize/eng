# Changing_a_flight_booking 
# I.Tips on how to change or cancel theflight booking for free
> As the refundable airfares[可退款机票] are astronomically /ˌæstrə'nɔmikli/ [adv.极大的] high, travelers especially those travel for leisure[休闲旅客], tend to purchase a non-refundable ticket. Then how can a holder of the latter change the booking without being charged?

> If you are booking a ticket for travel within, from, or to the United States[或者出发地或目的地是美国], you are entitled to a fullrefund on non-refundable tickets within 24 hoursof booking as long as your flight is at least 7 days away—with[起飞7天前] no cancellation /ˌkænsə'leʃən/ [n.取消] fee. Some air lines have even more generous policies than[比法律要求更宽松] what is required by law, such as American Airlines and Delta[美国航空公司和三角洲航空公司]. 

> If you just want to change travel dates or itinerary /aɪ'tɪnərɛri/ [n.旅行], there are certain airlines that allow this without charging a change fee, though you may still have to pay more if the airfare has risen since your original purchase. For instance, Alaska Airlinesdoes not have a change fee for flights wholly within Alaska[阿拉斯加航空公司对阿拉斯加境内的航班不收取改签费].

> Another option is to book your flight using frequent flyer miles[飞行常客里程] or points[积分预订航班]. Most frequent flyer tickets will have significantly lower fees for flight changes or cancellations than paid tickets. Some may even have no fees depending on your status /'stetəs/ [等级] with the airline.

# II.grammar
# 1.confirmation number & reservation number & e-ticket number
> Yeah, it's just the number that they need to look up your information. Now confirmation, this is a noun and it comes from the verb "to confirm" which means to double check.Right, so she does say "number," but it could be like a mix of letters and numbers, like in this case, right?Yes, because his confirmation number is UA1705.Right. Maybe that's like United Airlines 1705.

# 2.itinerary /aɪ'tɪnərɛri/ [n.行程]
> But itinerary, this is basically your travel schedule.Yes, anytime you go traveling, you make up a travel plan, and another word for a travel plan is itinerary.That's right. And that is what they pull up when they look up your confirmation number. 

# 3.departing flight [n.出发航班] & arriving flight & incoming flight & return flight & departure /dɪ'pɑrtʃɚ/ [n.出发 & adj.]
> 1)so departing flight. Well, first of all, to depart means to leave.Yes, it's a little more formal than saying just "your leaving flights." 

> 2)Now, we say "departing flight," but we also could say "your outgoing flight."Yes, exactly and it has the same meaning. Now, what else do we use departing for?Yeah, like it could be for other things, like a boat or a bus even.Yes, but we usually just say "return flight" actually.

> 3)Departure is a noun and well it also acts as an adjective, and it means once again "to depart." "departing flight." That's because the flight is leaving. The plane is actually departing. But here the time, it's not leaving; it's not departing; it will stay. So that's why we use "departure." Another example is "a departure gate.[登机口]" The gate is not going anywhere.That's where you wait to board your plane. That's the "departure gate." We also say "departure date.

> 4)Usually, “departing” is a verb while “departure” is a noun, but in this lesson, both “departing” and “departure” are used as adjectives. [一般而言，“departing”是动词,“departure”是名词。但是本次课程中，“departing” 和 “departure”都用作形容词.]In this sense, “departing” is used for the thing that's leaving or moving away. The gate where passengers board the plane does not move, so it's called a “departure gate.”[乘客上飞机的门不移动,所以这个门叫“departure gate] But planes move away, so we say the “departing flight.”[ “departing”用作离开或离去的事物。飞机是可以动的，所以我们说“departing flight（出发航班）]

# 4.charge fee [n.改签费用]
> so the change fee, of course, is the price that you have to pay to change your flight ticket.It's a pretty simple expression, "change fee." Others, lots of different kinds of fees, when you park your car, you have to pay a fee.Yeah, you have service fees, school fees, and sometimes hidden fees.

# 5.aisle /aɪl/ seat [n.靠近走廊的位置] & window seat [n.靠窗的位置]
> 1）so this is something that I always say, aisle seats. This is the seat that is, I guess, close to the aisle or hall way of the plane.Yes, that's where the, the stewardesses are walking, and the people are walking. That's the aisle. And the spelling here is kind of funny, it's A-I-S-L-E, but we say "aisle."

> 2) so the window seat of course is the seat beside the window and this is beside the middle seat and then lastly the aisle seat.Yeah, for sure Yes, exactly. And the middle seat, no one wants the middle seat.No one wants the middle seat.

# 6.layover [n.转机途中的短暂停留] & a connecting flight  & stopover
> 1)Yes, so "layover" is a short stop in your trip. So for example, if I am flying from Vancouver to Shanghai, I might have a layover in Beijing.Yes, now the difference is that layovers are usually pretty short.Yeah, or we even might call a layover "a connecting flight."

> 2)a stopover could be longer than one day.

# 7.nonstop [adj.直达的]
> 1) so "nonstop" basically means it doesn't stop, so there are no layovers or stopovers.
This could be for buses.

> 2)this could be for walking; this could be for talking. Like maybe you're on a nonstop flight, and someone next to you is snoring /snɔr/ [vi.打呼噜] nonstop.Yeah, that's the worst. Oh, but another thing that often happens to me on flights, is that you might end up sitting next to someone who talks nonstop.

# 8.economy class [n.经济舱] & economical & business class [n.头等舱]
> 1)"economy" as an adjective /'ædʒɪktɪv/  means the best value for your money, so often you'll hear phrases like the economy package.And the full phrase is economy class. Class is just the area of the plane, but we just say "economy."

> 2)economical. That is another adjective, and it means that something saves money. For example, sharing a car with someone is more economical than driving one by yourself.

> 3)it's well, it's usually more expensive, right?A long time ago, it was called "second class" and economy was called "third class," but that just makes people feel bad.Yeah, right, because you're not in the first class.But they still say "first class," don't they?They do. Makes you feel special, right?

# 9.upgrade [v.升舱] & update
> 1）So "upgrade" here means get a better one or an improved one, so if you don't like the small economy seats, you can go to business class.so there are a lot of different things that you can upgrade, though. So you can upgrade an old computer system. You can upgrade your hotel room too, right?

> 2)it's a little bit different from "updates," like update a computer. "Upgrade" is when you get a new one, a better one. "Update" means you're using the same one, but you get like a little fix, something is fixed or just updated.
