# I.The many controversies of Zara
> Zara is an incredibly popular brand, with over2000 stores around the world. But just because they have been very successful doesn't mean thatthey haven't attracted their fair share of criticism /'krɪtə'sɪzəm/ [n.批评] along the way. In 2011, Zara found itself introuble because one of their bag designs contained a swastika/'swɑstɪkə/[n.纳粹党所用的十字记号] - the symbol of Nazi Germany. According to the company, that oversight was the fault of one of their suppliers[n.供应商]. Along similar lines, in 2014, another one of their designs attracted a lot of negative attention because it was claimed that the shirt looked like the uniforms that the Nazis made the Jewish people wear in World War II. In response, the company insisted that they were trying to designa shirt that looked like something what a sheriff/'ʃɛrɪf/[n.(美国)县的司法长官] would wear in the Wild West[美国西部]. But perhaps their biggest controversy came in 2016 when several independent /'ɪndɪ'pɛndənt/ designers[n.独立设计师] accused Zara of stealing their designs and selling them for a much cheaper price. Boycotts /'bɔikɔt/ [n.抵制] and protests /prəu'test/ [v.抗议] followed, but they weren't enough to stop the giant retailer from continuing its expansion into shopping malls around the world[巨头零售商的发展脚步].

# III.A double negative sentence: hasn't been without
> Did your English grammar teacherever tell you that it's incorrect touse /tauz/ [vi.粗暴对待] a double negative sentence[双重否定句]? Well they were wrong! Englishspeakers use these kinds of sentences all the time! We evensee one in today's lesson: 

***Zara'ssuccess hasn't been withoutcontroversy.*** 

> So why don't we justsay "Zara's success has had lots ofcontroversy" or something likethat? Well, usually when Englishspeakers use a double negative, they are emphasizing something. In this case we want to emphasizethat even though Zara issuccessful, it has also had a lot of controversy. [一般英语里用双重否定的时候，就是在强调某事。在这里，我们用双重否定想表达的是，Zara虽然很成功，他也遇到过很多争议.]

> Often, people will add a possessivepronoun like "his" "her" or "its" before the noun. This doesn'tchange the meaning, but rather justmakes it sound more natural.[在名词前加上his,her或者its。这并不会改变意思，但是听起来却更加自然一些.]Most importantly, you can use this pattern with many different tense of the verb "to be." 

***Their relationship hasn't been without its problems.***

***The product tests haven't been without success.***

***Our growth hasn't been without struggle and setbacks.***

***The movie,although popular,isn't without its critics.***

***His journey wasn't without its ups and movies.***
