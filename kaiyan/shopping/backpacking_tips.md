# Backpacking tips

# I.A brief history of backpacking
# 1.The birth of backpacking as we know it
> In the 1950s and 60s, young people seeking spirituality /ˌspɪrɪtʃu'æləti/ [n.精神] and freedom began traveling overland from Europe through Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan /æf'gænə,stæn/ and Pakistan to India and Nepal, and sometimes Thailand. They packed light [轻装上阵] and kept costs low by hitch /hɪtʃ/ hiking [搭便车] and taking buses. This "hippy trail" [嬉皮之路] came to an end in 1979, when the Iranian revolution [伊朗爆发革命] and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan closed the route. [苏联入侵阿富汗]But Asia is still the most popular place for first-timers.

# 2.The first backpacker guidebook
> In 1972, Maureen and Tony Wheeler travelled from London to Australia. After arriving in Melbourne /ˈmɛlbən/ , Tony wrote Across Asia on the Cheap, the first Lonely Planet guidebook.

# 3.Backpacking in numbers
> 1)“4”:The most common number of beds in a dorm, according to Hostelgeeks.com. It is upwards
