# Bachelor party & Bachelorette party

# I.The history of bachelor party
> The bachelor party goes back much further than you'd expect. It's rooted in [起源于] ancient history — as early as the 5th century B.C.[最早可以追溯到公元前五世纪]

> It is believed that the ancient Spartans /'spɑ:tən/ [n.斯巴达人]were the first to make a celebration out of the groom's last night as a single man.

> Spartan soldiers held a dinner in their friend's honor and made toasts on his behalf — with, one assumes, a Spartan sense of decorum /dɪ'kɔrəm/ [n.礼貌;礼仪]. Since then, the events have generally grown more raucous /'rɔkəs/ [越来越火热].

> In the past, a bachelor party could commonly involve a black-tie dinner [身着礼服] hosted by the groom's father, with toasts to the groom and the bride.

> Bachelor parties are now as diverse as the bachelors involved, ranging from Las Vegas trips to a casual party with friends and/or the fiancée.

> First and foremost[最重要的是], the event is an important step in saying goodbye to one's single life and relieving pre-wedding jitters /'dʒɪtɚz/ [紧张氛围].

> There doesn't even have to be a party: some men now opt for "groom's showers," in which they acquire their own dowry /'daʊri/ [n.嫁妆] of football tables and power tools.

# II.Is there actually a purpose to having bachelorette parties？
> Bachelorette /ˌbætʃələ'rɛt/ parties were modeled after the centuries-old bachelor party, which is historically a dinner given by the bridegroom to his friends shortly before his wedding. Although the practice of giving a party to honor the bride-to-be goes back for centuries, the term bachelorette party itself did not begin until the 1960s.

> Nowadays, this term is used for a wide variety of parties – mainly celebrating the bride-to-be's new journey into marriage[步入婚姻、走上人生新旅程的聚会]. Some brides choose to have this party before the big day whilst others question the importance of having one in the first place. Is there actually a purpose to having a bachelorette party or is it just a waste of time?

> Actually, a lot of good can come out from having a bachelorette party. First, it honors the old chapter of the bride-to-be before she enters the new one. Second, it allows the bride-to-be to take some time off of the wedding madness and to let her hair down with her girlfriends. Last but not least, as the bride-to-be can really plan something according to her taste, it can be quite special and awesome.
