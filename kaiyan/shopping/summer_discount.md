# 1.gorgeous

If you need a word that means more than just beautiful, you can use gorgeous.Gorgeous. Yeah, make sure that you're really, yeah, you know, you draw out that first, first part of it, makes it sound much more natural and much more gorgeous.So Diana, we can use this to talk about bags, of course. But what else can, what else is gorgeous?Yeah, really. I guess the first thing that comes to my mind is smile. Someone has a really nice smile, you could say, "Ah, they have gorgeous smile".

# 2.summer sales [n.大减价] & on sale & sale & deals [n.减价、促销]
> 1)Right. This is an event where you can get a lot of stuff for much cheaper than the normal price.That's right. In fact the, the stuff that Diana's talking about, we often say that it's on sale.

> 2)I got it on sale. But the big event where you go shopping, whether it's at the mall or online, it's just called a sale.

> 3)And here deals just means, you know, when something goes on sale, it becomes a deal, because it's cheaper than normal.Yeah, you save money.Yeah. So you can have good deals you could have bad deals.Yeah, very true, very true. I've got some bad deals in my life, but some great deals as well.

# 3.snag [v.把握住]
> Yes. Very colloquial way to say you got it.You were able to grab it.You were able to grab it, and you're actually lucky to grab it, because it probably will go very quickly.Lots of people want to snag it.Exactly. So this is a great term you can use when you're talking about a sale. And, you know, things are going quickly because everybody wants to get them for low prices.Sure, sure, sure. I'm also thinking like, like maybe a really big concert or something, a really famous singer is coming and tickets are really hard to get.So you might can, you might say to your friend, "Oh, I, I snagged a couple of tickets. I'm so lucky for doing that."
