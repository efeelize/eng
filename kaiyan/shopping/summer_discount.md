> Starting with clothing, Levis, Victoria's Secret, Urban Outfitters and Brooks Brothers can all ship to China. Online fashion sites [海淘网站] such as shopbop.com, revolveclothing.com also offer great services and prices for Chinese customers.

> For those Chinese customers who prefer to shop for luxury items, then look no further than Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue. Some American cosmetic brands, like Peter Thomas Roth and Skinstore, are also China-friendly. If you are not into clothes or cosmetics, but are more into health and fitness
