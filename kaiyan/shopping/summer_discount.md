So this is a great term you can use when you're talking about a sale. And, you know, things are going quickly because everybody wants to get them for low prices.Sure, sure, sure. I'm also thinking like, like maybe a really big concert or something, a really famous singer is coming and tickets are really hard to get.So you might can, you might say to your friend, "Oh, I, I snagged a couple of tickets.

Policy, could we just say it's just like rules?They mean rules, but we wouldn't use rules.Right. So we always use policies. And policies are always gonna have certain restrictions.So to be, maybe like within thirty days.
