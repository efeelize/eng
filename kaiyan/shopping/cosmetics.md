# I.Where do Americans buy their cosmetics and skincare?
> We all know department stores, such as Macy's [梅西百货]and Nordstrom, sell high-end beauty products. For those with deeper pockets,[有钱人] it's a great way to get your cosmetics all at once[一站式解决化妆品], especially since every brand has their own tester counter [试用柜台] where you can try their products before buying. Once you do decide to buy something, you will often get lots of samples [得到很多小样] with your purchase, or if you're lucky, you might even be given a free gift as a token of appreciation[得到一份礼品作为答谢]. However, they don't often sell hair and body care products, so you'd have to either go to Sephora or a specialty store.

> This is why most Americans head to the drugstore[药店], such as CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid, for more reasonably priced products that perform just as well[功能相近的产品]. Since there are many people who blog and vlog about beauty for a living [有很多人通过博客和视频作为职业给大家介绍美妆产品], just a little bit of online research will help you choose which products to get. Many drugstore brands [药店品牌will create dupes /dup/ [仿制] of popular high-end cosmetics so that those who don't want to spend that much money can enjoy a similar product for a fraction of the cost, whether this be mascara /mæ'skærə/ [睫毛膏], lipstick, or eyeliner [n.眼线]. Many drugstores themselves will also create dupes of the most popular drugstore brand skincare and haircare products, such as shampoo, sunscreen, and moisturizer /'mɔɪstʃəraɪz/ [n.保湿霜], which you can get for even less.
