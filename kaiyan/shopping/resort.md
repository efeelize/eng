# I.The differences between a resort and a hotel
> Fundamentally, a resort /rɪ'zɔrt/ [度假区] is a place of recourse whereas a hotel is a temporary residence [临时住处] while away from home.Resorts are places that provide relaxation and recreation /ˌrɛkrɪ'eʃən/ [休闲娱乐] over and above accommodation, meals and other basic amenities.

> In other words, a resort combines a hotel and a variety of recreations, while a hotel is a place that offers you lodging /'lɑdʒɪŋ/ and meals [食宿].People specifically frequent resorts for relaxation or for recreation. They are the places targeted for family vacations [家庭度假].

> On the other hand, a hotel can be used for a short stay or for a vacation [暂住或度假]. But people may stay at hotels for a long duration depending on the purpose of the stay and the visit [出行目的和居住目的].

> Another important difference between a resort and a hotel is their location.Hotels are normally located near popular destinations [热门目的地] such as near airports, railway stations [城镇的机场] of major cities and towns or in business areas or localities.Resorts, on the other hand, are located in the midst of natural and picturesque surroundings [自然风景秀丽的地区].

# II.Common facilities and services in a resort
> Special facilities [设施] will vary according to the resort, but there are some common facilities and services usually found in resorts.

> These can include a swimming pool, a spa and sauna or steam room [水疗桑拿馆], a gym, a restaurant and a bar, and sometimes a spa center, or wellness center [健康中心], where massage [按摩], facial treatments [面部护理], and other pampering /'pæmpɚ/ [vt.纵容;宠;娇养] treatments are provided.

> There may also be a childcare service [儿童托管服务] during school holidays, and if it is a beach resort [滨海度假村], daybeds [沙发床] with full waiter service can also be available [服务员提供全套服务].

> Many resorts will also have a business room [商务室], where computers, faxes and telephones are free for use.Resorts are often located near sporting [运动场地] or outdoor activities [户外项目场地], such as water-skiing [滑水], golf, rock climbing [攀岩], snow skiing [滑雪], or scuba /'skjʊbə/ diving /'daɪvɪŋ/ [水肺潜水], and resorts will have a booking service available for guests.

> Many resorts will have a pick-up service available [接送服务], where they can arrange for a driver to meet you at the airport and transport you and your luggage to the resort.At the end of your stay, they can arrange for a driver to return you to the airport.

# III.grammar
# 1.过去分词从句 (after) having + 过去分词
> 1) So basically this means like once something has happened,it basically means like "since".it is known as the perfect participle clause. This clause is used for the following reasons:

- 1. It clearly shows that one action happens before another and expresses a reason for a second action or thought.

- 2. “After having seen the reviews, I don’t think I’ll stay at that hotel.” In this sentence, the perfect participle (having seen the reviews) shows us that this is the first action, and this action is the reason why the speaker doesn’t want to stay in that hotel.Note that “after” is not necessary here but it emphasizes the time.

> 2)It can make sentences shorter by allowing us to omit conjunctions like “and,” “because” and “since.”

- “I must say, I have seen your photos online and the lobby is even more stunning in person.”

> 3)However, “having + pp” allows you to omit “and,” so the speaker simply said, “I must say, after having seen your photos online, the lobby is even more stunning in person.”

- 1. After having met him for the second time, my impression totally changed.

- 2. We changed our minds about the issue after having had a few meetings.

- 3. I got a sunburn after having spent too much time in the sun.

# 2.the sth is better/worse than sth...
> 1)it is often used to emphasize favorable and unfavorable outcomes that result from the increase or decrease of a particular factor in a situation, thing or phenomenon.We might also say it doesn't always have to be used for things that are good, it could be used for things that aren't good, and a lot of times you could, like maybe say the cheaper the product is, the worst the quality is.

> 2)The + comparative adjective (+ clause) + the + comparative adjective (+ clause).

- The older I get, the wiser I become.

- The stronger, the better.

> 3)The + more/less (+ clause +) the + comparative adjective (+ clause)./ The+more/less（+从句）+the+形容词比较级（+从句）

- 1. The more I travel, the better I am at navigating.

- 2. When it comes to eating seafood, the fresher the better.

- 3. The cheaper the price, the worse the quality is.

- 4. Minimalists believe the less you own, the better.

# 3.shall & should
> 1)"Sh all" is super super formal so Samantha probably works in an environment where she's got a lot of really rich people, probably fairly important people and she's probably expected to be very formal. a lot of times when someone says "shall we do this" or "shall we do that", you can respond by saying "we shall".

# 4.resort [n.度假区]
> it's not a hotel. When I think about a hotel I think some people are there for fun, some people are there because they have to be there, but not everybody is there to have a good time .There are tired business people, there are families that you know maybe I'm visiting my family in a different city. A resort makes me think about like Disney World like we're all staying at this hotel in the middle of Disney World.That's right so obviously there are many other resorts than just the Disney resort.But most popular beaches you know around the world or the nicer beaches anyway usually have resorts. 

# 6.adj
## 1)marvelous [adj.棒极了] 
> So marvelous here just means like wonderful or amazing or excellent.It's all of those things and it can be used with pretty much all of the same words: marvelous food, marvelous weather, marvelous view.a marvelous time, I had such a marvelous time at the resort.

## 2)uxury [n.豪华型] 
> So luxury just means like really fine.it is a great word to use if you are at a resort where you have to pay a lot of money because a lot of these resorts really aren't cheap, the reason for that being that these are luxury resorts. luxury resorts are very luxurious. well fine in the sense of expensive, very expensive.Luxury cars that's the first thing that comes to my mind.

## 3)& fine-dining [n.高级餐饮] & hoity-toity [adj.傲慢的,装腔作势]
> fine-dining which just usually means expensive, you know it's hoity-toity.this "fine" is not the... like "fine thanks and you" kind of fine, this is like the you know I'm spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on this meal and it'd better be very fine. I actually I'm not a big fan of fine-dining I feel like, maybe I'm just too poor but, every time I've ever eaten what's supposed to be fine-dining is super-expensive and super-small. we both kind of eat for nutrition that is sort of the way that we enjoy eating a good meal for us, a fine meal for me would be one that is, you know doesn't have to be too cheap but it has lots of nutrients.it's gotta be filling but I find that fine-dining will be really small and I spend all this money and I'm like "man I'm still hungry".

## 4）award-winning [adj.获奖的]
> so award-winning well we've won awards.For being an awesome podcast.Award-winning I mean really there are lots of awards in the world and there's almost so many awards that everyone probably has won an award at this point but usually these awards are pretty important.so basically you just like kind of like you know recognition.makes me think about like award-winning directors or an award-winnning moive.

## 5)stunning [adj.迷人的]
> so "stunning" is a great word here, basically when I think about being stunned I think about like "I can't move, I'm just so captured by this beauty or by this surprise or by this something that I can't move".so basically when you find something stunning, you are really impressed, you might say you're in awe, you might say wow... You think something is so amazing, so beautiful, so marvelous.

## 6)mountain view suites/apartment [adj.山景]
> if something is like mountain view, it is put in a place where you can just see the mountains.We basically use it as an adjective like our mountain view suites or a mountain view apartment, something like that.

# 7.amenities
## 1)features [n.功能、特点]
> Features can be anything, it's the most general word here, a dish could have a feature, a city could have a feature, it's just the special thing about it.we pretty much all have cell phones these days, and you'll you'll hear about what features your cell phone might have or your computer might have right?

## 2)amenities [n.便利设施] 
> amenities, something that is often very specific to a hotel or to a resort.it is kind of the thing that is meant to be enjoyed,  now often when I think about amenities, the first thing that comes into my mind is swimming pool.so like the amenities could be like kind of part of the features but you're right, the amenities are more specific like maybe this hotel has this kind of shampoo but this resort has this other kind of shampoo and it's their special kind of amenity.It's their special shampoo that only they have.that could be both a feature and an amenity,

## 3）facility /fə'sɪləti/ [n.设施]
> 1)amenities are meant to be enjoyed and facilities are more kind of practical and they are like a tool.They're meant to be used.when I think about a facility I'm thinking more about the pipes. Like in order to make that swimming pool warm or that hot tub hot, there needs to be you know a giant room full of pipes and a guy working on those pipes right? That is part of the facilities, part of the equipment.So like a spa can be an amenity or also a facility.

> 2)and sometimes we even jokingly say we we call the bathroom the facility.The facilities means the bathroom, and it's the same thing that is a room where you will find a lot of pipes, very very useful pipes.

## 4）equipment [n.] & equipped with sth [v.]
> 1)that's probably the way I've heard the word the most is the car is equipped with blah blah blah, of course, you can also have like the new iPhone is equipped with blah blah blah.

## 5）lounge /laʊndʒ/ [n.休息室]
> so a lounge is just like a usually a pretty comfy place that you can relax and maybe listen to some relaxing music and drink some you know cocktails and eat some food.

## 6）suites /swi:t/ [n.套房] & oceanfront suites [n.海景套房]
> so speaking of pronunciation "suite" is kind of a funny-looking word but it's the same pronunciation as sweet like candy or sweets like a bag of candy. you know I mean you're you're learning your own mother language and I remember like seeing a hotel in my town and they advertised suites but when I first saw the word as a kid I thought it was suits.just like a suit that you wear to work or to a business meeting or whatever. So guys here even though it looks a lot like suits it's not suit, it's suite.

## 7）spa [n.水疗]
> So spa services here would just be all the different things you can do at a spa a lot of Chinese people use this word when speaking Chinese, you know it's a place where you might get like massages or a facial. I really like getting massages at the spa.

## 8）concierge  /kɔn'sjɛrʒ/ [n.旅馆服务台人员] & 24-hour front desk [n.前台]
> 1)"concierge" and "front desk" because in some places these are two very different ideas, two very different concepts, often very different people as well but in other places they can refer to the same thing.it depends on how luxurious the place you're staying is.

> 2)like concierge in my mind should be a person who is there to take care of you.they basically at a place like a resort, they might help you arrange you know certain activities and services, maybe you need to get a car to take you somewhere, they can arrange that, maybe you want to go out for a night on the town or go on a tour, the concierge could help with that.

> 3)front desk is there to take care of you sure, but really they're just giving you your room key. Taking your credit card and giving you the key, but they're not really going to help you beyond that.so you wouldn't want to call the 24-hour front desk at 3 in the morning to say like "I want to go to the club, where is the club, get me a car". The front desk is not as concerned with that part of your stay.

## 9)room service [n.客房服务，客房送餐] 
> You can stay in your room and order food which is room service.

## 10)safe-deposit box / safe / deposit box [n.保险箱]
> so safe deposit box this actually you will hear just safe by itself a lot, you will hear deposit box a lot by itself and you'll also hear safety deposit box.so this is just kind of like a box or sometimes a bit bigger than a just a regular box that you can lock your stuff into.

## 11)lagoon /lə'gʊn/ pool [n.潟湖泳池] 
> so lagoon pool is like a more naturally shaped kind of pool，kind of more like naturally shaped, it's just a kind of whatever shape.it's usually kind of like rounding.basically a lagoon is usually like some sort of lake or body of water you might find in a forest somewhere or maybe even next to the ocean but not you know connected to the ocean.it's either next to ocean or a lake and it's connected but not really，It's a rock, so there's some sand and something is kind of blocking so it's a part of the ocean and a part of the lake but at the same time not really.

## 12）infinity pool [n.无边际泳池]
> finite which basically means to have an end to have a limit but if it's infinite, then it just has no limit.

## 15)watersports [n.水上运动]
> so water sports is just kind of sports in the water.All the things you do. And even like the idea of sports.Like water polo [水球] is a good example, but I think that like just driving a boat around or going water skiing I think that also counts as water sports, or surfing or something like that.

## 16)kayaks /'kaɪæk/ [n.皮划艇] 
> so kayaking can include water sport.a kayak it's covered so it has a hole and you have to actually put your body in the hole and then you sort of paddle this boat.

## 17)canoes /kə'nu:/ [n.独木舟]
> so a canoe is basically like it's a small boat that you're kind of maneuvered /mə'nʊvɚ/ [v.掌控] by yourself, and, but it has a opened top，You just sit in this boat.

## 18)paddleboard /ˈpædlˌbɔrd/ [n.冲浪板] & paddling [v.用桨划]
> we have the paddleboard here which is kind of like a surfboard but you stand on top of it and you push with the paddle.It's the most simple, because it is just a board so you're not actually in something, you are just on something.so if anything you know happens, you can always just jump off

# 8.units
## 1)estate [n.土地，区域]
> usually when I think of estate, I think of like a big fancy house on a lot of land.it also makes me think about, you know a big old castle or something, but when you die you also have an estate, when you sadly leaves the world you will have an estate, it's all the things that you has ever owned all of your assets all of you dead, everything will be there in his estate.usually we divide up the estate and give it to our loved ones after we pass away.

## 2)acre /'eɪkɚ/ [n.英亩]
> So acre is just a type of way that we measure the size of land in the west, usually in the US.

## 3) hectare /'hektɑ:/ [n.公顷]

> 2)feet are smaller than meters, roughly a little over three feet in one meter,

# 9.n+side 
## 1)poolside bar [n.泳池边吧台] 
> Poolside bar, at a lot of these places the staff at the poolside bar, they're really nice, this pool is obviously not an indoor pool, it's an outdoor pool and it's a nice day I can enjoy a nice drink, so poolside just means it's now one word instead of saying on this side of the pool.

## 2)beachside bar [n.海滩边吧台]

## 3)oceanside

## 4)moutainside 
>  that sounds like you're on a mountain and the home or the property is on the side of a mountain and that sounds like if I were a real estate agent, I would use that word to kind of try to sell my property like, oh, it's mountainside, oceanside, beachside.

# 10.on site [phr.在现场] & off site

> 2)There is an "off site". So here they're talking about vacation activities on site but also a lot of resorts they will offer activities off site, It might be a club night or something like everyone gets into a bus and goes to a club in the city something like that.or maybe they organize like rock climbing or zip lining or something like that in the nearby forest or something like that you know.so there're always activities on site but there're also always activities off site as well.

# 11.overlooks [v.俯瞰，俯视]
> if something overlooks something it just basically means kind of looks down.it doesn't mean to like look down on somebody or something, it just means to actually be over like above something.so you know luckily actually, some months ago I stayed in a really nice place which overlooked the Pacific Ocean and it was beautiful. so basically overlook just means to be over something and then from there you can look out at it, so maybe like you climb a mountain and it overlooks the city.of course you could be on a mountain and you could be overlooking the valley, You could have a home on top of the mountain and wake up every day and think "Hmm it's so marvelous how I every day overlook the valley.

# 12.access /'æksɛs/ & to be able to access sth,& accessible [adj.] & be accessible to everyone / handicap accessible 
> 1)"Access" can be like a noun but it can also be like a verb.the thing is it's usually people think of it as a verb first, like access this or access that, access the file, access the information, but here yeah it is a noun like you can have access to a place.

> 2)having access basically means you have permission, you're allowed to go into this lounge, you're allowed to look at these files.

- 1.we have after hours access to the club house.

- 2.I can't access that information because I don't have access to the files.

> 3)so basically if something is accessible then you have access to it.Or you can access it, so basically accessible would just be the adjective form of this word.

> 4)be accessible to everyone meaning maybe I would make a hotel and it would have lots of stairs lots of steps but that's not really accessible if you were in a wheelchair.so these kind of places we might say they're like handicap accessible.And I think even now the trend is to drop the handicapped or drop the wheelchair and just say accessible and then just kind of expand the meaning of this word.accessible to everyone.

# 13.undergone [v.经历，经受]
> so to have undergone means to just have done something，in life we usually undergo many changes.or we can all say you know at the end of our lives you know "well we have all undergone many changes".

# 14.unwind /ˌʌn'waɪnd/ [v.放松，轻松]

> so basically if something is all inclusive, you just don't have to pay any more money for it, but we also use this in places that are not necessarily vacations, like for example my apartment, that I'm in is an all inclusive apartment meaning I don't pay the water bill or the power bill, it's just all inclusive.

# 16.good eye [phr.好眼力]
> we try really hard not to make mistakes, but of course we are human and we do make mistakes especially typos /'taɪpo/ [n.打字错误], typos are really hard sometimes to avoid and so if someone does catch one of our mistakes, I do often say good eye.so it's just: Hey, thanks for seeing that error. I didn't even see that myself.

# 17.I'll see you to your room/  I'll take you to your room  [phr.带您去您的房间]
> 1)you will commonly hear this and hotels and we say the service industry, hospitality, so here I'll see you to your room, it's just kind of like a more fancy way of saying I'll take you to your room.

> 2)so in my building there are lots of elevators and to take the elevators and so if I have friends that come to visit me, when they're leaving, I'll say like: Oh, I'll see you to the elevator or I'll see you downstairs or I'll see you to your car or something depending on the person of course.
