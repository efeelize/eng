# I.The differences between a resort and a hotel
> Fundamentally, a resort /rɪ'zɔrt/ [度假区] is a place of recourse whereas a hotel is a temporary residence [临时住处] while away from home.Resorts are places that provide relaxation and recreation /ˌrɛkrɪ'eʃən/ [休闲娱乐] over and above accommodation, meals and other basic amenities.

> In other words, a resort combines a hotel and a variety of recreations, while a hotel is a place that offers you lodging /'lɑdʒɪŋ/ and meals [食宿].People specifically frequent resorts for relaxation or for recreation. They are the places targeted for family vacations [家庭度假].

> On the other hand, a hotel can be used for a short stay or for a vacation [暂住或度假]. But people may stay at hotels for a long duration depending on the purpose of the stay and the visit [出行目的和居住目的].

> Another important difference between a resort and a hotel is their location.Hotels are normally located near popular destinations [热门目的地] such as near airports, railway stations [城镇的机场] of major cities and towns or in business areas or localities.Resorts, on the other hand, are located in the midst of natural and picturesque surroundings [自然风景秀丽的地区].

# II.Common facilities and services in a resort
> Special facilities [设施] will vary according to the resort, but there are some common facilities and services usually found in resorts.

> These can include a swimming pool, a spa and sauna or steam room [水疗桑拿馆], a gym, a restaurant and a bar, and sometimes a spa center, or wellness center [健康中心], where massage [按摩], facial treatments [面部护理], and other pampering /'pæmpɚ/ [vt.纵容;宠;娇养] treatments are provided.

> There may also be a childcare service [儿童托管服务] during school holidays, and if it is a beach resort [滨海度假村], daybeds [沙发床] with full waiter service can also be available [服务员提供全套服务].

> Many resorts will also have a business room [商务室], where computers, faxes and telephones are free for use.Resorts are often located near sporting [运动场地] or outdoor activities [户外项目场地], such as water-skiing [滑水], golf, rock climbing [攀岩], snow skiing [滑雪], or scuba /'skjʊbə/ diving /'daɪvɪŋ/ [水肺潜水], and resorts will have a booking service available for guests.

> Many resorts will have a pick-up service available [接送服务], where they can arrange for a driver to meet you at the airport and transport you and your luggage to the resort.At the end of your stay, they can arrange for a driver to return you to the airport.

# III.grammar
# 1.(after) having + pp
> 1)it is known as the perfect participle clause. This clause is used for the following reasons:

- 1. It clearly shows that one action happens before another and expresses a reason for a second action or thought.

- 2. “After having seen the reviews, I don’t think I’ll stay at that hotel.” In this sentence, the perfect participle (having seen the reviews) shows us that this is the first action, and this action is the reason why the speaker doesn’t want to stay in that hotel.Note that “after” is not necessary here but it emphasizes the time.

> 2)It can make sentences shorter by allowing us to omit conjunctions like “and,” “because” and “since.”

- “I must say, I have seen your photos online and the lobby is even more stunning in person.”

> 3)However, “having + pp” allows you to omit “and,” so the speaker simply said, “I must say, after having seen your photos online, the lobby is even more stunning in person.”

- 1. After having met him for the second time, my impression totally changed.

- 2. We changed our minds about the issue after having had a few meetings.

- 3. I got a sunburn after having spent too much time in the sun.

# 2.the sth is better/worse than sth...
> 1)it is often used to emphasize favorable and unfavorable outcomes that result from the increase or decrease of a particular factor in a situation, thing or phenomenon.

> 2)The + comparative adjective (+ clause) + the + comparative adjective (+ clause).

- The older I get, the wiser I become.

- The stronger, the better.

> 3)The + more/less (+ clause +) the + comparative adjective (+ clause)./ The+more/less（+从句）+the+形容词比较级（+从句）

- 2. When it comes to eating seafood, the fresher the better.

- 3. The cheaper the price, the worse the quality is.

- 4. Minimalists believe the less you own, the better.

# 3.shall & should
> 1)"Sh all" is super super formal so Samantha probably works in an environment where she's got a lot of really rich people, probably fairly important people and she's probably expected to be very formal. a lot of times when someone says "shall we do this" or "shall we do that", you can respond by saying "we shall".

# 4.resort [n.度假区]
> it's not a hotel. When I think about a hotel I think some people are there for fun, some people are there because they have to be there, but not everybody is there to have a good time .There are tired business people, there are families that you know maybe I'm visiting my family in a different city. A resort makes me think about like Disney World like we're all staying at this hotel in the middle of Disney World.That's right so obviously there are many other resorts than just the Disney resort.But most popular beaches you know around the world or the nicer beaches anyway usually have resorts. 

# 6.adj
## 1)marvelous [adj.棒极了] 
> So marvelous here just means like wonderful or amazing or excellent.It's all of those things and it can be used with pretty much all of the same words: marvelous food, marvelous weather, marvelous view.a marvelous time, I had such a marvelous time at the resort.

## 2)uxury [n.豪华型] 
> So luxury just means like really fine.it is a great word to use if you are at a resort where you have to pay a lot of money because a lot of these resorts really aren't cheap, the reason for that being that these are luxury resorts. luxury resorts are very luxurious. well fine in the sense of expensive, very expensive.Luxury cars that's the first thing that comes to my mind.

## 3)& fine-dining [n.高级餐饮] & hoity-toity [adj.傲慢的,装腔作势]
> fine-dining which just usually means expensive, you know it's hoity-toity.this "fine" is not the... like "fine thanks and you" kind of fine, this is like the you know I'm spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on this meal and it'd better be very fine. I actually I'm not a big fan of fine-dining I feel like, maybe I'm just too poor but, every time I've ever eaten what's supposed to be fine-dining is super-expensive and super-small. we both kind of eat for nutrition that is sort of the way that we enjoy eating a good meal for us, a fine meal for me would be one that is, you know doesn't have to be too cheap but it has lots of nutrients.it's gotta be filling but I find that fine-dining will be really small and I spend all this money and I'm like "man I'm still hungry".

## 4）award-winning [adj.获奖的]
> so award-winning well we've won awards.For being an awesome podcast.Award-winning I mean really there are lots of awards in the world and there's almost so many awards that everyone probably has won an award at this point but usually these awards are pretty important.so basically you just like kind of like you know recognition.makes me think about like award-winning directors or an award-winnning moive.

# 7.facilities
## 1）suites /swi:t/ [n.套房]
> so speaking of pronunciation "suite" is kind of a funny-looking word but it's the same pronunciation as sweet like candy or sweets like a bag of candy. you know I mean you're you're learning your own mother language and I remember like seeing a hotel in my town and they advertised suites but when I first saw the word as a kid I thought it was suits.just like a suit that you wear to work or to a business meeting or whatever. So guys here even though it looks a lot like suits it's not suit, it's suite.

## 2）spa [n.水疗]
> So spa services here would just be all the different things you can do at a spa a lot of Chinese people use this word when speaking Chinese, you know it's a place where you might get like massages or a facial. I really like getting massages at the spa.

## 3）concierge  /kɔn'sjɛrʒ/ [n.旅馆服务台人员] & 24-hour front desk [n.前台]
> 1)"concierge" and "front desk" because in some places these are two very different ideas, two very different concepts, often very different people as well but in other places they can refer to the same thing.it depends on how luxurious the place you're staying is.

> 2)like concierge in my mind should be a person who is there to take care of you.they basically at a place like a resort, they might help you arrange you know certain activities and services, maybe you need to get a car to take you somewhere, they can arrange that, maybe you want to go out for a night on the town or go on a tour, the concierge could help with that.

> 3)front desk is there to take care of you sure, but really they're just giving you your room key. Taking your credit card and giving you the key, but they're not really going to help you beyond that.so you wouldn't want to call the 24-hour front desk at 3 in the morning to say like "I want to go to the club, where is the club, get me a car". The front desk is not as concerned with that part of your stay.

## 4）room service [n.客房服务，客房送餐] 
> You can stay in your room and order food which is room service.

## 5）lounge /laʊndʒ/ [n.休息室]
> so a lounge is just like a usually a pretty comfy place that you can relax and maybe listen to some relaxing music and drink some you know cocktails and eat some food.






# 10.on site [phr.在现场] & off site 
> 1)so "on site" just means like "at the resort". the site is the location. In fact we often use the word "site" to mean location right? Like "the job site", where your job is or where a job is.or you might think of the word "website". it's a location on the web.

> 2)There is an "off site". So here they're talking about vacation activities on site but also a lot of resorts they will offer activities off site, It might be a club night or something like everyone gets into a bus and goes to a club in the city something like that.or maybe they organize like rock climbing or zip lining or something like that in the nearby forest or something like that you know.so there're always activities on site but there're also always activities off site as well.

# 11.overlooks [v.俯瞰，俯视]
> if something overlooks something it just basically means kind of looks down.it doesn't mean to like look down on somebody or something, it just means to actually be over like above something.so you know luckily actually, some months ago I stayed in a really nice place which overlooked the Pacific Ocean and it was beautiful. so basically overlook just means to be over something and then from there you can look out at it, so maybe like you climb a mountain and it overlooks the city.of course you could be on a mountain and you could be overlooking the valley, You could have a home on top of the mountain and wake up every day and think "Hmm it's so marvelous how I every day overlook the valley.
