# I.The differences between a resort and a hotel
> Fundamentally, a resort /rɪ'zɔrt/ [度假区] is a place of recourse whereas a hotel is a temporary residence [临时住处] while away from home.Resorts are places that provide relaxation and recreation /ˌrɛkrɪ'eʃən/ [休闲娱乐] over and above accommodation, meals and other basic amenities.

> In other words, a resort combines a hotel and a variety of recreations, while a hotel is a place that offers you lodging /'lɑdʒɪŋ/ and meals [食宿].People specifically frequent resorts for relaxation or for recreation. They are the places targeted for family vacations [家庭度假].

> On the other hand, a hotel can be used for a short stay or for a vacation [暂住或度假]. But people may stay at hotels for a long duration depending on the purpose of the stay and the visit [出行目的和居住目的].

> Another important difference between a resort and a hotel is their location.Hotels are normally located near popular destinations [热门目的地] such as near airports, railway stations [城镇的机场] of major cities and towns or in business areas or localities.Resorts, on the other hand, are located in the midst of natural and picturesque surroundings [自然风景秀丽的地区].

# II.Common facilities and services in a resort
> Special facilities [设施] will vary according to the resort, but there are some common facilities and services usually found in resorts.

> These can include a swimming pool, a spa and sauna or steam room [水疗桑拿馆], a gym, a restaurant and a bar, and sometimes a spa center, or wellness center [健康中心], where massage [按摩], facial treatments [面部护理], and other pampering /'pæmpɚ/ [vt.纵容;宠;娇养] treatments are provided.

> There may also be a childcare service [儿童托管服务] during school holidays, and if it is a beach resort [滨海度假村], daybeds [沙发床] with full waiter service can also be available [服务员提供全套服务].

> Many resorts will also have a business room [商务室], where computers, faxes and telephones are free for use.Resorts are often located near sporting [运动场地] or outdoor activities [户外项目场地], such as water-skiing [滑水], golf, rock climbing [攀岩], snow skiing [滑雪], or scuba /'skjʊbə/ diving /'daɪvɪŋ/ [水肺潜水], and resorts will have a booking service available for guests.

> Many resorts will have a pick-up service available [接送服务], where they can arrange for a driver to meet you at the airport and transport you and your luggage to the resort.At the end of your stay, they can arrange for a driver to return you to the airport.

# III.grammar
# 1.(after) having + pp
> 1)it is known as the perfect participle clause. This clause is used for the following reasons:

- 1. It clearly shows that one action happens before another and expresses a reason for a second action or thought.

- 2. “After having seen the reviews, I don’t think I’ll stay at that hotel.” In this sentence, the perfect participle (having seen the reviews) shows us that this is the first action, and this action is the reason why the speaker doesn’t want to stay in that hotel.Note that “after” is not necessary here but it emphasizes the time.

> 2)It can make sentences shorter by allowing us to omit conjunctions like “and,” “because” and “since.”

- “I must say, I have seen your photos online and the lobby is even more stunning in person.”

> 3)However, “having + pp” allows you to omit “and,” so the speaker simply said, “I must say, after having seen your photos online, the lobby is even more stunning in person.”

- 1. After having met him for the second time, my impression totally changed.

- 2. We changed our minds about the issue after having had a few meetings.

- 3. I got a sunburn after having spent too much time in the sun.

> 2)The + comparative adjective (+ clause) + the + comparative adjective (+ clause).

- The older I get, the wiser I become.

- The stronger, the better.

> 3)The + more/less (+ clause +) the + comparative adjective (+ clause)./ The+more/less（+从句）+the+形容词比较级（+从句）
