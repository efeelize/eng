# Tipping headache
# I.North America’s tipping culture is becoming increasingly oppressive and costly.
> According to a Vice article by Vanmala Subramaniam, North American tipping practices have become increasingly oppressive /ə'prɛsɪv/ [adv.沉重地]. Merely a decade ago, 10 percent was considered an acceptable gratuity /ɡrə'tuəti/ [n.小费] and 15 percent was given for impeccable /ɪm'pɛkəbl/ [n.完美无缺的] service. Today, those numbers have risen by 5 percent, making 15 percent the new standard of acceptability /ək,septə'biləti/[n.可接受性].

> Additionally /ə'dɪʃənli/ [adv.加之,又], the pressure to tip in the modern age[现代] appears to stem /stɛm/ [vt.遏制] more strongly from cultural obligation[文化义务] rather than the expectation of good service. Many feel the need to match the tips of their dining partners and feel ashamed by the thought of not tipping enough. There is also a general belief that customers should help supplement /'sʌplɪmənt/ [vt.增补] the low wages of servers. However, tipping can create wage disparity /dɪ'spærəti/ [n.不一致] between servers and kitchen workers as servers typically take home the bulk of[大部分的] the tip.

> Ironically, despite originating in the U.K., tipping in Britain has become rare with gratuity expectations falling far below North America’s. The change in perspective was brought about by[这种观点的改变是由于] a minimum wage[最低工资] increase which eliminated /ɪ'lɪmɪnet/ [vt.消除] the need for customers to supplement employee wages. Although many have demanded that a similar custom should be adopted in North America, it remains to be seen whether any changes will be made in the near future.
