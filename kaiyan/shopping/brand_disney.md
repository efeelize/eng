> Disney’s big break came from the creation of Mickey Mouse in 1928. Their first feature-length animated film, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, premiered in 1937 and became the highest-grossing film of that time.

> Walt Disney envisioned expanding into the amusement park industry after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters, and in 1955, opened the first Disneyland to the general public.
