# I.Your refund rights with retailers
> New York State law does not generally require any retail merchant to have a specific refund, credit[n.积分] or exchange policy. Specific refund policies can range from "100% money back guarantees[“100%退款”]" to "no refunds or exchanges whatsoever[“无论如何不退款不换货”].”However, you may be entitled[都有权利] to a replacement or refund, regardless of the store policy, if the goods you purchased were defective (i.e. not fit for the intended purpose).

# 1.All merchants are required to post their return policies
> If a store does not properly post its return policy, you are entitled to a refund or credit (at your option) [要求退款或者索要积分（你自己选择）]within 30 days of purchase, as long as [只要] you have a receipt or purchase verification[购买凭证] and the merchandise is undamaged and unused.

# 2.Their policy must be posted on a sign. 
> The sign must tell you whether the merchant gives refunds.and, if so, under what conditions. The sign must also advise customers that they can receive a written copy of the return policy upon request[如果顾客需要，可以为其提供纸质版的退货政策说明].

# 3.Check that an item has a tag attached when youbuy it.
> Ask the salesperson whether a particular item is returnable or exchangeable, and to clarify any policies that may be unclear to you.

# 4.Save all receipts or other paperwork for the itemsthat you purchase.

# II.grammar
# 1.seeing as/ that & because & considering that
> The phrase “seeing as” (or “seeing that”) is similar to saying "because" or "considering that". It's used to introduce a reason for another statement and is usually a fact we must consider or accept. In today’s lesson, the first statement “you bought it last month” explains why “the warranty doesn’t cover a refund,” so we can say the phrase “seeing as you bought it last month.” 

- Seeing as we've already bought tickets,we may as well go to the game.
- I think I'll take his advice about my diet,seeing that he's a doctor.
- Seeinng as this is our fifth date,shouldn't we talk about our relationship?

# 2.portable /'pɔrtəbl/ [adj.移动的]
> 1)portable :It means I can move it.so portable is something that can be moved.basically anything you can take with you can be called portable.So for example, a laptop computer is really just a portable computer.Alright, it's kind of like the word mobile, but you know, we don't say portable phone anymore, we say mobile phone, a little different.

> 2)hard drive [硬盘] : you know the computer, you save things in it. Anyway, a portable one is you can take it with you. 

> 3) portable toilet /'tɔɪlət/ & porta John &  porta potties /'pɑti/[便携马桶]: a portable toilet is that toilet that's outside, in the big plastic stall.usually in a park or something.

# 3.out of the blue
> so out of the blue, it just means that something happened suddenly.Yeah, out of the blue like I didn't expect it.Right, so you can say, "Hey, Tommy just showed up out of the blue."Yeah, he came, I didn't know he was coming.Right, or the weather just got really cold out of the blue.

# 3.refund [n.退款] & exchange [n.换货] & store credit [n.店铺积分]
> 1）So when it stops working suddenly, you want your money back.Yes, and that's what refund means.Yeah, so basic, to fund, fund is to like pay for something, right? So a refund would basically be to fund, give the money back to the person who paid it.

> 2)so exchanges like maybe getting another hard drive.switching it for a similar, or like a little cheaper one maybe, or more expensive one.An exchange is trading the broken hard drive for a new hard drive.

> 3)So when you get store credit, you can basically spend the same amount of money that you spend on the product you're returning.so that's still kind of like store credit. But basically store credit, so let's say he bought a hard drive, and let's say it was a hundred dollars. He returns the hard drive, but decides to spend that hundred dollars on something else.

# 4.receipt [n.收据] & proof of purchase [n.购买凭证]
> 1) so receipt is just that piece of paper that says how much money you spent on the thing you bought.That's right. It's sometimes called bill of sale, but that's kind of an old word.ah, no, we just say receipt. So whether you're buying food, or portable hard drives, or you know clothes, whatever, you go to the store, they give you a receipt when you pay for what you bought.Right, and just notice the spelling here "receipt".Yeah, it's not /ri'sept/, /ri'si:pt/, it's /ri'si:t/.Yeah, so don't worry about "p" guys. So a receipt is just a proof of purchase.Sometimes stores, they'll say, "Oh, would you like us to email the receipt to you?" Something like that.Save some paper.

> 2)Right, so a receipt is just a type of proof of purchase. So why would the customer service representative ask if he has some other types of proofs of purchase?if you buy a house or a car, there might be another type of proof of purchase.Or maybe Frank doesn't have the receipt that they gave him when he bought the hard drive, but maybe he got an email.

# 5.money-back guarantee [n.退款保单] & warranty & policy 
> 1）so 30-day money-back guarantee. So this just means within thirty days of buying, purchasing a product, they will give you your money back, they guarantee.so it's been over a month I guess since he bought it, so there's no guarantee on his money back.that means we can't promise that we'll give you the money back, it basically means, if it's past thirty days you get nothing.

> 2)Warranty is kind of like guarantee in that, it's a time, a period of time, after you buy a product that you can return it.Yeah, it's kind of like a policy, right? So it's a policy that has to do with purchases.

# 6.cover [v.覆盖]
> 1）So here this term cover, so basically we use this with warranty to describe what a warranty can and can't do. Like your insurance on your house might cover water damage, but it might not cover fire damage.

> 2)Yes, so for example, if my phone suddenly stops working, well maybe the warranty will cover it.But, if it was my fault, like if I smash my phone into the ground, because I was angry. Well, the warranty might not cover that.How can they prove that? I will say warranties usually, they cover when a product stops working or breaks, but warranties do not cover theft.Right, unless you buy some really expensive insurance.

# 7.faulty /ˈfɔlti/ [adh.瑕疵的]
> 1）it basically means that when it was made, there was already a problem.Basically any product that might have some sort of problem, even when you just bought it, it could be called faulty.

> 2)like when the machines are making it in the factory, maybe the machine made a mistake.I'm thinking of like a car, you can say the car might have faulty brakes, or faulty engine.

> 3)You could say faulty thinking, someone is not logical.

# III.pattern
***Hi. How may I help you today?***

***I purchased this portable hard drive last month and it just stopped working out of the blue. I'd like a refund.***

***Okay sir, do you have your receipt or some other type of proof of purchase with you?***

***Oh, I'm sorry sir, it appears that this item only has a 30-day money-back guarantee. Seeing as you bought it last month, I'm afraid the warranty doesn't cover a refund at this point.***

***But I think it's a faulty product. Why else would it just stop working?***

***Well, to test whether the product is faulty, you'll need to take it to a different location.***

***Come on. That's a bit inconvenient, don't you think?***

***I'm afraid that's our policy sir. If you don't want to do that, I can give you store credit, or you may exchange the hard drive for a new one.***

***Ok, I'll just take the store credit then.***
