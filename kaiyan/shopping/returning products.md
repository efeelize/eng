# I.Your refund rights with retailers
> New York State law does not generally require any retail merchant to have a specific refund, credit[n.积分] or exchange policy. Specific refund policies can range from "100% money back guarantees[“100%退款”]" to "no refunds or exchanges whatsoever[“无论如何不退款不换货”].”However, you may be entitled[都有权利] to a replacement or refund, regardless of the store policy, if the goods you purchased were defective (i.e. not fit for the intended purpose).

# 1.All merchants are required to post their return policies
> If a store does not properly post its return policy, you are entitled to a refund or credit (at your option) [要求退款或者索要积分（你自己选择）]within 30 days of purchase, as long as [只要] you have a receipt or purchase verification[购买凭证] and the merchandise is undamaged and unused.

# 2.Their policy must be posted on a sign. 
> The sign must tell you whether the merchant gives refunds.and, if so, under what conditions. The sign must also advise customers that they can receive a written copy of the return policy upon request[如果顾客需要，可以为其提供纸质版的退货政策说明].

# 3.Check that an item has a tag attached when youbuy it.
> Ask the salesperson whether a particular item is returnable or exchangeable, and to clarify any policies that may be unclear to you.

# 4.Save all receipts or other paperwork for the itemsthat you purchase.

# II.grammar
# 1.seeing as/ that & because & considering that
> The phrase “seeing as” (or “seeing that”) is similar to saying "because" or "considering that". It's used to introduce a reason for another statement and is usually a fact we must consider or accept. In today’s lesson, the first statement “you bought it last month” explains why “the warranty doesn’t cover a refund,” so we can say the phrase “seeing as you bought it last month.” 

- Seeing as we've already bought tickets,we may as well go to the game.
- I think I'll take his advice about my diet,seeing that he's a doctor.
- Seeinng as this is our fifth date,shouldn't we talk about our relationship?

***Hi. How may I help you today?***

***I purchased this portable hard drive last month and it just stopped working out of the blue. I'd like a refund.***

***Okay sir, do you have your receipt or some other type of proof of purchase with you?***

***Oh, I'm sorry sir, it appears that this item only has a 30-day money-back guarantee. Seeing as you bought it last month, I'm afraid the warranty doesn't cover a refund at this point.***

***But I think it's a faulty product. Why else would it just stop working?***

***Well, to test whether the product is faulty, you'll need to take it to a different location.***

***Come on. That's a bit inconvenient, don't you think?***

***I'm afraid that's our policy sir. If you don't want to do that, I can give you store credit, or you may exchange the hard drive for a new one.***

***Ok, I'll just take the store credit then.***
