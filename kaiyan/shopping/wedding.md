# I. Top 5 Wedding Differences: America v. China
# 1.Dancing
> At Western weddings, people don't usually leave when the dinner is finished. Instead, after the meal a DJ or wedding band will begin playing music, and guests of all ages can start dancing.

# 2.Speeches 
> During the reception, expect to hear speeches from many different members of the wedding party, as well as the parents of the bride and groom.

# 3. Gifts
> Not a lot of [很少] newly weds[新婚夫妇] receive cash as wedding gifts in America (even if they want it!). Instead, guests will usually choose something from the bridal registry /'rɛdʒɪstri/ [新婚夫妇列出的礼品清单] to purchase for the happy couple.

# 4. Attire
> In the West, most guests will dress up [着盛装] for weddings. As for the bride and groom [新郎], they will wear the same clothes all day.

# 5.Photos
> Instead of taking the wedding photos weeks before the big day, In America they will usually be taken between the ceremony and the reception[招待晚宴]. This way, not only do the bride and groom look their best, so do all of the bridesmaids /'braɪdzmed/ [伴娘] and groomsmen /ˈɡrumzmən/ [伴郎].

# II.grammar
# 1.后缀-ize
> 1) suffix "-ize" on the end of a noun or adjective, the whole word means something like "to make [root word]" or "to render [root word]." [用ize作为后缀，整个词的意思就是『使….怎么样』『致使』。]

> 2)These new words begin as verbs, but if you go further and add a "d" to the end, they can be adjectives as well. As such, "Westernize" is a verb that means to make more Western, and "Westernized" is an adjective that means "more Western."[组成的新词就是动词，但是如果结尾加个d，也可以用作形容词]

> 3)In the past, this suffix was added to many Latin and Greek words, which is why we have words like "recognize" or "organize." [过去，这个后缀经常加在很多拉丁语的词或者希腊语词后]

> 4)These days, we usually see it attached to new ideas, new words, or even new technology. A great example of this would be taking the the ride-sharing company Uber and making the word "Uberize." So to "make more like Uber" means something like "to deeply change a model of economic activity by using technology."[使用科技深刻改变一个经济活动的模型]

- 1. The government plans to invest a lot of money to modernize [现代化] the rail system.

- 2. If drugs are legalized[合法化], won't that cause many social problems? 

- 3. Our company can help you to customize [量身打造] your order. 

- 4. After the accident, many workers were hospitalized. [受伤住院了]

- 5. The new CEO has been centralizing power [集中权力] since the day he arrived.

***It sure is! I’m just not sure what to expect though. Are weddings here like the ones in the West?***

***Well, as you can imagine, Chinese weddings are super traditional. But recently they’ve been getting more Westernized.***

***Well now the bride typically will put on a white Western wedding dress for at least one part of the reception. The groom usually wears a tuxedo.Usually the guests just wear whatever. You don’t need to be too fancy[太隆重].***

***Good to know. What about a gift? Do they have a bridal registry[结婚礼物登记单]?***

***No, no. Just stuff some money into a red packet and you’re good to go!***

***Anything else I should be aware of?***

***Just be ready with your glass of baijiu to toast the bride and groom when they show up at your table.***
