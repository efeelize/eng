# I. Top 5 Wedding Differences: America v. China
# 1.Dancing
> At Western weddings, people don't usually leave when the dinner is finished. Instead, after the meal a DJ or wedding band will begin playing music, and guests of all ages can start dancing.

# 2.Speeches 
> During the reception, expect to hear speeches from many different members of the wedding party, as well as the parents of the bride and groom.

# 3. Gifts
> Not a lot of [很少] newly weds[新婚夫妇] receive cash as wedding gifts in America (even if they want it!). Instead, guests will usually choose something from the bridal registry /'rɛdʒɪstri/ [新婚夫妇列出的礼品清单] to purchase for the happy couple.

# 4. Attire
> In the West, most guests will dress up [着盛装] for weddings. As for the bride and groom [新郎], they will wear the same clothes all day.

# 5.Photos
> Instead of taking the wedding photos weeks before the big day, In America they will usually be taken between the ceremony and the reception[招待晚宴]. This way, not only do the bride and groom look their best, so do all of the bridesmaids /'braɪdzmed/ [伴娘] and groomsmen /ˈɡrumzmən/ [伴郎].

# II.grammar
# 1.后缀-ize
> 1) suffix "-ize" on the end of a noun or adjective, the whole word means something like "to make [root word]" or "to render [root word]." [用ize作为后缀，整个词的意思就是『使….怎么样』『致使』。]

> 2)These new words begin as verbs, but if you go further and add a "d" to the end, they can be adjectives as well. As such, "Westernize" is a verb that means to make more Western, and "Westernized" is an adjective that means "more Western."[组成的新词就是动词，但是如果结尾加个d，也可以用作形容词]

> 3)In the past, this suffix was added to many Latin and Greek words, which is why we have words like "recognize" or "organize." [过去，这个后缀经常加在很多拉丁语的词或者希腊语词后]

> 4)These days, we usually see it attached to new ideas, new words, or even new technology. A great example of this would be taking the the ride-sharing company Uber and making the word "Uberize." So to "make more like Uber" means something like "to deeply change a model of economic activity by using technology."[使用科技深刻改变一个经济活动的模型]

- 1. The government plans to invest a lot of money to modernize [现代化] the rail system.

- 2. If drugs are legalized[合法化], won't that cause many social problems? 

- 3. Our company can help you to customize [量身打造] your order. 

- 4. After the accident, many workers were hospitalized. [受伤住院了]

- 5. The new CEO has been centralizing power [集中权力] since the day he arrived.

# 2.Plus One [n.男伴/女伴]
> So we could actually say like the person, your guest, your friend is the plus one.this can be anybody, and on this case, they are two friends are maybe coworkers, people who are not necessarily in a relationship.

# 3.attending [v.出席] & participate in 
> attending is, you know, that's pretty formal, attend a wedding, attend a class.Attend a ceremony /'sɛrə'moni/ [n.典礼,仪式].Attend a meeting.it just means go to participate in, but, but like you said, more formal.

# 4.milestone [n.里程碑]

# 5.bride [n.新娘] & groom [n.新浪] & bridesmaids [n.伴娘] & groomsmen [n.伴郎] & wedding gown /ɡaʊn/ [n.婚纱] & wedding dress & tuxedo /tʌk'sido/ [n.燕尾服] & tux & tuxes
> 1）wedding gown：a gown is just a fancy dress.So at one point, bride will be wearing a beautiful white wedding dress or we could also say, "wedding gown."

> 2)We're so lazy, so we just say tux. Most guys look good in tuxes.James Bond, 007[double O senven ] looks really good in a tux.

# 6.reception [n.宴会]
> This is when the dinner essentially where you give speeches and so a wedding will have a ceremony and a reception.

# 7.dress up [phr.隆重打扮] & overdressed & underdressed 
> 1)actually dress up here just means, put on really nice fancy clothes.

> 2) so if you go to a wedding in jeans, you are underdressed.

> 3) if you go to a class at school wearing a tux,you are overdressed.

# 8.bridal /'braɪdl/ registry /'rɛdʒɪstri/ [n.婚礼礼物登记单] & bridal /'braɪdl/ shower
> 1）So basically the couple before the ceremony, they'll go to maybe some department stores, fancy stores that they like, and they choose the things that they want for gifts.So you don't have to guess, you just go to the store, look up the registry under their names, and basically choose your price.

> 2) But also if you go to a bridal shower, so before the wedding, the bride will have a party, her friends will give her a party. Um also if they have a baby shower, so there's a party when they're about to have a baby.

# 9.Anything else I should be aware of & self-awareness [n. 自我认知]
> 1）So it just means, is there anything else I need to know? This I could imagine this question in hundreds of different contexts, right? And anything else I should be aware of?Yeah, my mother.she finds out a secret.

> 2)Some people have no awareness of other people.and they only have like self-awareness. And other people have like, no self-awareness, right? They don't know anything about themselves.
