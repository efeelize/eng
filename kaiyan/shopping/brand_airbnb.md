# Airbnb
# I.Airbnb's history 
> Have you ever wondered what the "bnb" stands for in "Airbnb?" It stands for "bed and breakfast", which is a type of hotel in the West where the hosts provided you with a room in their house and some breakfast in the morning.

> In fact, the original name of the site was airbedandbreakfast.com. The founders of the site , Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, were roommates in San Francisco, who couldn't afford to pay their rent[但谁也付不起房租]. Instead of moving out of town or finding a cheaper place, they changed their living room into a bedroom that travellers could sleep in. Then, in the morning they also fed them breakfast! Cute! Of course, because they were living in San Francisco, a lot of the guests were fellow techies[搞技术]. After developing a simple website, the idea took hold: shortening their name to airbnb, they were able to find investors to help them grow.

> Today the company has gone international and has more listings than any hotel groups in the world, with 1,500,000 listings [注册房源] in 191 countries.

# 1.现在完成进行时 Present perfect continuous [PPC]
> In general, the PPC is another way to say "recently" or "lately". In today's dialogue, one of the speakers says that they have been browsing the Airbnb app: In other words, they have recently been looking for a place to stay, and most importantly, still continue to look at this very moment.

- 1. she has been waiting for you all day.

- 2. John has been working for an accounting company.

- 3. I've been living in New York since 2013.

- 4. We've been working nonstop all day. We need a break!

- 5. Have you been drinking? Why are your eyes so red?

- 6. We've been telling her that she needs to leave her boyfriend, but she just won't listen!

- 7. You've been coming to this restaurant for 5 years and you still need to look at the menu!?

# 2.过去进行时 the past continuous 
> The biggest difference between the two that when you use the PPC, the action usually started in the past and continues into the present (or the result of the action is still clearly seen in the present).[动作通常会在过去开始，一直持续到目前的（或行动的结果仍清楚地看到在目前）] When you use the Past Continuous, on the other hand, the action has already finished.

- 1. she was waiting for you all day.

- 2. John was working for an accounting company.

***Matt, have you used Airbnb before?***

***Yes. Several times. It’s a great alternative to hotels. Are you travelling?***

***Yes, I’m planning a family trip to the States.***

***Airbnb is perfect then. You can get an entire apartment or just a room. It’s much more comfortable than being stuck in a tiny hotel room.***

***I’ve been browsing their app. The photos all look beautiful. Are the places really that nice?***

***Well, they do Photoshop the pictures to make them look prettier. Places often look bigger than they actually are, but I'd say the real deal isn’t too far from what you see.***

***That’s good to know. Do you need to pay a deposit?***

***It all depends on the host. The listings will show if a security deposit is required and how much.***

***Ok. Is there any housekeeping?***

***Again, it depends on whether the host includes it or not.***

***Any other advice?***

***I’d say try to choose a location you like and narrow down your search based on that to find the place that suits your situation and budget.***

***Good to know.***

***And one last thing, I find the guests' ratings and reviews very helpful too.***

***Got it. Thanks for your help!***
