# I.The Hippie Culture
> Today's lesson introduced a group of travelers called Hippies /'hɪpi/.The hippie movement in the United States began as a youth movement[n.青年人运动]. Made up of mostly white teenagers and young adults between 15 and 25 years old, hippies inherited /ɪn'hɛrɪt/ a tradition of protesting /'protɛst/ [n.抗议] and anti-war movements[反战运动]. By 1965, hippies had become an established social group in the U.S., and the movement eventually expanded to other countries, extending to the UK and Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, Mexico, and Brazil. 

> The hippie mentality /mɛn'tæləti/ [n.精神] influenced many musicians throughout the world. Hippie culture spread worldwide through a fusion /ˈfjuʒən/ [融合] of rock music, folk[乡村], blues, and psychedelic /'saɪkə'dɛlɪk/ rock[迷幻摇滚]; it also appeared through literature[文学], plays[喜剧], fashion, films, and art. In 1968, self-described [自诩为] hippies represented just under 0.2% of the U.S. population and faded in popularity faded in popularity by the mid-1970s.[在70年代后慢慢开始衰落]

> In 1972, when newlyweds Tony and Maureen Wheeler traveled from Europe to India, along what was called the Hippie Trail /trel/ , they had little to guide them.Travel books in those days were stale /stel/ reads, providing exhaustive details on historical /hɪ'stɔrɪkl/ sites with little mention of the things that young, independent and budget-conscious travellers were seeking: beaches, bars and hostels /'hɑstl/ [n.青年旅社].

> After so many young people inquired about their trip, the Wheelers wrote "South East Asia on a Shoestring /'ʃustrɪŋ/ " which quickly became the backpackers' bible.The book eventually evolved into Lonely Planet, the world's most beloved travel guidebooks informing and inspiring travellers around the globe.

> Ever wondered [你是否好奇过]where Lonely Planet got its name? It actually started as a mistake when Tony Wheeler misheard a song line. The actual lyrics were "lovely planet". But he decided to stick with the name because Lonely Planet stood out more[更别具一格].

> They were more adventurous /əd'vɛntʃərəs/ [adj.爱冒险的], and I mean travel in the sixties and seventies was for the wealthy.And, so the hippies kind of they wanted to do these things but of course being hippies they didn't have a lot of cash, so yeah they kind of made travelling and backpacking more mainstream.

# II.grammar
# 1.newlyweds /ˈnuliˌwɛdz/ [新婚夫妇] & newly hired & newly released 
> So when someone gets married or they're recently married, we call them newlyweds.Exactly. So you may see other expressions like newly hired, newly released, but those are all two words. Same kind of idea, it's it's new. But this one is definitely one word.

# 2.stale /stel/ [adj. 不新鲜的;陈旧的、沉闷的]
> Exactly. But they were just kind of not fresh. And stale is a great word because you can actually describe it, use it to describe food, (stale bread), yeah but it also can describe trends.Pokemon go. That's pretty stale right now.

# 3.exhaustive [adj.详尽无遗的] & exhausting [adj.使人精疲力竭的]
> exhaustive:It just means complete. Very complete. This is like too complete. 

# 4.seeking [v.寻求] & look for & inquire /ɪn'kwaɪr/ [v.询问] & inquiry [n.调查]
> 1)seeking:Really look for. It's like a quest or a crusade /kru'sed/ [n.十字军东征], you're seeking truth. Which you will often hear, yeah you're just really really looking for something.

> 2)But you know in personal sections of, you know newspapers. You know, man seeking woman that kind of thing, or woman seeking man. And so it just means you're really looking for.

> 3)So to inquire is just to really ask a lot of questions.It's very formal, yeah.Inquiries, for inquiries please call 55555555.Exactly. It's more business-related or more formal.

# 5.on a shoestring /'ʃustrɪŋ/  [phr.勒紧裤腰带、十分节约]
> The shoestring. Another good word for people that don't have any money.Yeah. And it just means like if you imagine a shoelace or shoestring, it's very narrow, so your budget is very narrow.

# 6.backpackers' bible [背包客的圣经] & to go backpacking [n.徒步旅行]
> 1)backpack:It's basically just a big bag where you carry everything in it.So basically the backpackers' bible, these people used it as their their holy book of traveling.

> 2)to go backpacking:So the verb is to go backpacking.Yes. And in fact, years ago when I went traveling, I went backpacking.Right. And I mean for some people it's great, for other people you have to carry everything on your back like a turtle.

# 7.evolved [vt. & vi. 演变; 进化] & devolved /dɪ'vɑlv/ [vi.衰落]
> 1)so evolve, sounds like we could be in a biology class.It's when something evolves, it gets better. And it's always a positive thing.

> 2) And it's basically you're on backwards, becoming less civilized.

# 8.beloved /bɪ'lʌvd/ [adj.挚爱的]
> Right, and it just means people love that person.So you can write a romantic love letter and say my beloved. Yes, another word that you may see as an adjective like this sometimes is learned[adj.博学的、学术的]. Again, very…Learned man. Very formal, both of these are very very formal.

# 9.misheard [v.听错]
> t sounds like it actually started as a mistake. Yeah a lot of things do, kind of started out as mistakes. Because I guess it actually was "lovely planet" in the song, but you know lonely planet just sounds…Well you said before that "lovely planet" sounds kind of cheesy /'tʃizi/ [adj.虚伪的].but "lonely planet" is kind of unique, and it makes you think about when you travel, often you are alone and it's alone in the world and this guide will help you be less alone.

# 10.stick  with doing sth  [v.继续坚持、沿用] & stick to do sth 
> It just basically means stay with or follow, not change something. If you stick to a budget for example, you're just you are following that budget, but it's just a different way of expressing it.

> Yeah, the only like grammatical difference I could think of is often we use "stick to doing something", whereas you never say "stick with doing something". But otherwise you can say "stick to the name" "stick with the name".

# III.名词+conscious
> You can also use conscious with other nouns like: weight, time, fat, carb, climate. Just like with budget-conscious, when you use these nouns with conscious, it means you are aware or concerned about that thing.[当你用到这些名词+conscious时，就代表你很在意这些事]
