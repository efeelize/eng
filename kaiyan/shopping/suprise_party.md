# I.How to plan a birthday party
> Whether you are planning a party for your own birthday, or you are helping a friend plan theirs, these steps will help you stay on track throughout the process.

# 1. Budget
> Remember to try and be realistic about the budget. Your budget doesn't have to be huge, especially because there are so many DIY decorations and activities you can do for the party.

# 2.Theme
> If you are planning your own party you are in luck! You can pick whatever theme you want. Whatever you choose, try to make the theme consistent throughout the party[让整个聚会风格保持一致]. Try to incorporate  /ɪnˈkɔrpəˌret/ [把…合并, 使并入] it into food, decor, and invitations.

# 3. Date
> Picking a weekend can be a good option because people will most likely be free of work and other plans. Choose a date far enough in advance so people will be able to mark their calendars.[提前选择日期，这样大家就可以尽早规划行程]

# 4. Venue /'vɛnju/ [n.地点]
> One of the best venues to choose is your own house or backyard. If you have it in your budget and you are celebrating a larger birthday, you should consider holding the party at a separate venue like a restaurant or hotel. 

# 5. Guest List
> If you are planning your own party, it is obvious who you want to invite. However, if you are planning someone else's party, make sure that you check with them to see who they want on their guest list.

# II.grammar
# 1.I was thinking of ...
> 1)this is a really useful phrase when you're talking about what you, what you want, what you want to do, what you're thinking about, what you're considering doing or getting.We use this pattern to talk about past or current plans. For example: “I was thinking of leaving early. Do you want to join?”

> 2)so another thing here is the past tense, you may have noticed, "I was thinking of getting." Now, this could mean the past tense. This could mean that he stopped thinking about it, but often especially in this situation when you're planning something, we use the past tense for the things we're considering now and that's just more of a polite way to talk. Like we often use the past tense, even only ask someone's name that we forgot, like we could say, "Hey, what was your name?"that's a good point and an important thing to remember. 

> 3)maybe you were thinking of trying a new restaurant. You can say "I was thinking of trying this new restaurant."Or maybe you have some people coming to your party and they don't really know when they're coming, so someone could say, like "Oh, they were thinking of coming at seven o'clock. Is that okay?"that’s fine,who knows when they’ll actually come?

- 1. They were thinking of coming over at 8:00. Is that okay?

- 2. I was thinking of going traveling next year.

- 3. He was thinking of dropping out of school.

# 2.party 
> And I'd say in North America, we have two types of parties: parties where we celebrate something, and parties where we don't really celebrate something.So if it's just like a regular dinner party, where you have some drinks just for fun, you're not really celebrating anything. But birthdays, housewarming parties, bachelor parties, they are celebrating something.

# 3.in charge of sth & to be on sth 
> 1)if you're in charge of something, that means you're in control of it. You're the one doing it. So, maybe at home, I might say, "Hey Connor, I'll be in charge of cooking, and you can be in charge of cleaning."

> 2)"To be on something" means, I'm doing it or I will do it.

# 4.decorations [n.] & decorate [v.] & blow up balloons /bə'lu:n/ [吹气球]
> 1)All parties need decorations. Balloons, signs, things that make the place feel fun,or festive. Like during Christmas, we can put up lights, trees, ornaments /'ɔrnəmənt/ [n.装饰;装饰物] on our trees.

> 2) We can decorate, that's the verb. We can decorate a room with decorations.

> 3)So "blow up" can also mean explode, like a bomb can blow up or even a person can blow up if they get really really angry. what if we blow up a balloon too much, do we say "You blow up the balloon until it blows up"?No, until it pops.

# 5.e-invite 
> 1)"I sent out an e-invite." Now let's look at this word "e-invite" first;So if you send out an e-invite, you send out an electronic invitation. like email means electronic mail.

> 2) So, you may be wondering, well, "invite" is a verb, why isn't this "e-invitation?" Well, it's because, well, "invitation" sounds pretty formal like maybe I'm gonna get a fancy card, like a wedding invitation, but these days we even use the word "invite" as a noun in a more casual way.more casual and shorter.Like if I invite my friend over for dinner, just a casual dinner, maybe he can't go, so he might say..."I can't go. Thanks for the invite."Yeah. So anyway, don't worry about invitation, invite. This is an e-invite and it's a word that we often use. But... So anyway, Ben is sending out, or has sent out these e-invites already.

# 6.sent out & distribute & put out [phr.摆放] finger food [n.小食] & give out & hand out 
> 1)proposition "out"：if you see this word "out" in a phrasal verb, like "send out," "give out," "hand out," it usually means it's going to many people, it's going to many places.

> 2)sent out：so it makes me think of like wedding invitations. Usually, you have a lot of guests at your wedding, so you need to send out wedding invitations to all the guests.

> 3)That word is "distribute," and it's kind of a synonym to this word.But we use the word "distribute" more when we give the people something directly, like we hand them food or something.

> 4) put out：at parties, you need to put out some finger food.Yes, always put out some food, so your guests don't get hungry. You're placing out food for other people to eat, and that's what it means here.we could also place out drinks, knives, forks, chopsticks, anything our guests are going to need to use.

> 5)finger food :we're not eating fingers here. Yeah, we're talking about food that you can eat with your fingers instead of a fork or spoon and a knife.And I find a lot of finger food, people just throw the word "mini" in front of it, so like mini hamburgers or mini sausages.like something on crackers /'krækɚz/ [n.咸饼干]，like maybe some type of cheese or spread on crackers,nachos /ˈnɑˌtʃo/ [n. (墨西哥人食用的)烤干酪辣味玉米片], It's tortilla /tɔ'tijə/ [n.玉米粉薄烙饼] chips with cheese and sometimes chicken. And oh, it's so good. You can eat with your fingers. You just need a plate and some fingers. So it's finger food.

# 7.keep it under wraps [phr.保密]
> 1)so if you want someone to keep a secret, you can say, "Hey, can you keep it under wraps?"Yeah, because when you wrap something up, when you wrap it, you hide it. You can't see it, so it's like a secret. It's in there, inside somewhere. We use this a lot. If you want something to be a secret for a little while longer, like maybe at work, someone's going to get a promotion, but everyone's keeping it under wraps until the boss announces it.Or maybe a business has a new product and people know it's coming, but maybe they haven't seen it yet, so it's still under wraps. But when it goes on sale, we'll all see it.

> 2)But "keep it under wraps" can be for bad things. It can be for scandals like, "Oh, they kept it under wraps."For sure. 

# 8.champagne & classy [adj.有气质的]
> 1)so champagne, you may know it's sparkling wine. It has bubbles and it's like white wine, I believe?Yeah, but it's pronounced /ʃæmˈpeɪn/, because it's... it's French.

> 2)And of course, if you have champagne at your event or at your party, it can make it a little classy."classy" means like sophisticated or stylish.So when I think of a classy party, I imagine it has expensive food and drinks and maybe like a band playing some fancy music.

> 3) it can also be used to talk about behavior, like... like a person who has high standards. If I think of a classy guy taking a girl out on a date, he probably arrives early in a nice, a nice button-down shirt, and a... and a nice coat and opens the door for her, and treats her really well on the date. That's a classy guy.
