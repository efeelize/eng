# I.Car Insurance
> Most places require all drivers to purchase insurance for cars or any other vehicles they may drive like boats, RVs [房车], motorcycles /'motɚ'saɪkl/ . In the United States and elsewhere, the purpose is to cover risk of financial liability or the loss of a motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision /kə'lɪʒən/ [n.碰撞,冲突,抵触] resulting in property or physical damages. 

> Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance [最低限额保险]. However, some states that don't require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, New Hampshire[新罕布什尔州], and Mississippi.

> When you want to purchase insurance for your car, you might be puzzled as from where you should get it. Are you supposed to deal with an insurance agent [中介] or you should you go online? Below are different features of captive agents [专属代理人], independent agents [独立代理人], or buying online[在线购买], so you can decide on the right path for you.

# 1.Captive /'kæptɪv/ agents
> If you are dedicated to a specific insurance firm [选择某家保险公司], it is advised that you buy your coverage /'kʌvərɪdʒ/ from a captive agent. Because captive agents deal with only one company, they know all the different insurance options offered by that company. Consequently, they can assist you to pick the right package based on your needs. Although, captive agents may take more time [更愿意花时间] in responding to your questions and your needs as compared to other independent agents who work for commission[拿佣金].

# 2. Independent agents
> If you would love to check out the different kinds of insurance provided by different companies, then you should buy a policy from an independent agent, because independent agents usually deal with several companies and not just a particular insurance firm. By doing this, you can get a better rate [拿到更低的价格]: since independent agents are not officially employed by any particular firm, they would not push one specific product [推销某个产品] and will tell you the right things about all the different insurance.

# 3. Buying online
> This option means skipping insurance agents completely and working directly with the company online. However, for this option, you have to do some of the work yourself. You need to conduct thorough research [展开调查] on different car insurance providers, know what they offer, their car insurance rates, and what all their policies cover. Then, you can talk to the company that best fits your needs to procure the coverage itself.

> Buying car insurance online has the advantage of being easy as all you need to do is fill in the registration details of the vehicle [车辆注册信息], provide the address, choose few other factors, click the pay tab, and there it is! A soft copy of your auto insurance policy will be emailed to your inbox, almost instantly.

# 2.brand new [adj.全新的] sweet ride & flashy [adj.高调的、引人注目的]
> 1)it's a great expression. I, somebody, I mean.She really does have a sweet ride. It's a very beautiful car. But I mean it could be any kind of car or vehicle.Yeah, it's something that's usually new and clean and shiny and basically it's a little fancier than your average car. Yeah. So now here Mike says what a sweet ride.

> 2)because it's a brand new car Mike says it's pretty flashy. can a Toyota Corolla be flashy? Maybe brand new.Yeah. I mean it can't, it probably not. But it doesn't have to be like a Ferrari or Maserati. But just something that, you know, looks, maybe it's red.

# 3.dealership/'dilɚʃɪp/ [n.汽车经销商] & carrier [n.运营商] & trade in [v.以旧换新] & lemons [n.质量很差的二手车、废物]
> 1)like the people who work at the dealership are car dealers.Now you kind of say car sales man. Man and woman and person. But, yeah, the company is the dealer or the dealership.

> 2)so every car needs insurance and you have to go through an insurance carrier. so recently we talked about phone carriers. it's just a word for a phone company.

> 3)So you go to the dealership with your crappy old car. They maybe look at it and say 'ok we'll give you a thousand bucks for it and you could buy this new car'.So now trade in can be a verb or a noun.

> 4)So imagine when you're, you have a piece of lemon in, you're eating in, your face kind of scratches. It's sour. So with the car that's a lemon. It kind of has a habit of breaking down. It doesn't work. It's not reliable so we call that a lemon.So, obviously a lemon is not worth very much at the dealership. But fortunately you know car dealers, car salesmen they really want to make things easy for you. They really want to sell you that car.

> 2) so your credit rating or your credit is just your reputation with borrowing money. 

> 3)The premium is just like the plan and the insurance company.And your payments as well. So your monthly payment. So any kind of bill you have to pay for insurance every month. House insurance, anything that is your premium. You wouldn't use this for any other bills really.

> 4)this is the money that you pay.So basically if you need to access your insurance money. you have to pay a little bit of money out front. And then you can, you know, the insurance company will pay off what they need to. So for example, someone broke a window in my car. And in order to have it fully covered I had to pay three hundred dollars first.

# 6.break the bank [phr.费用过高、太昂贵] & monthly payment & a total payment
> 1)so it’s going to use up all your money.

> 2)If you say "your premiums" it means per month.basically all we're saying is generally speaking, people pay their car insurance by the month.And my monthly premium or my monthly payment is only like 140. So they give you a little, they tack on a little bit of a charge, you know, for that monthly where they have to kind of keep billing you, kind of things.But generally for a lot of things, like I know, my home insurance. I pay monthly.

> 3)so if you just say "how much did it cost" that means overall the total. You have the overall cost. So for me, my insurance is 2,000 dollars a year. 

# III.pattern
***Wow, Michelle that’s a sweet ride you’ve got there! Is it new?***

***Thanks, Mike. Yup. I just picked it up from the dealership this morning.***

***It’s pretty flashy. Did you trade in your other car?***

***Yeah, but my last car was quite a lemon, so I didn’t get much for it.***

***Was it easy for you to get financing?***

***Luckily I have good credit, so my interest is only 2.9%.***

***That is a low rate. What are the payments like?***

***Well, it’s fully loaded with all the bells and whistles, so it was pretty pricey, but my payments are reasonable.***

***Which insurance carrier did you end up going with?***

***It was tough to choose. All of the insurance premiums were pretty high because it’s a brand new car. I ended up going with Allstate because they provided $5 million liability covering personal injury, comprehensive, and collision.***

***I was debating between State Farm, Geico, and Allstate, but ended up choosing Liberty Mutual because of the coverage.***

*** I thought about them too. Is your deductible really high?***

***No, it’s only $300.***

***That’s low. Hopefully, you won’t need it, but at least if you do, it won’t break the bank.***
