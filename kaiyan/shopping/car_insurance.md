# I.Car Insurance
> Most places require all drivers to purchase insurance for cars or any other vehicles they may drive like boats, RVs [房车], motorcycles /'motɚ'saɪkl/ . In the United States and elsewhere, the purpose is to cover risk of financial liability or the loss of a motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision /kə'lɪʒən/ [n.碰撞,冲突,抵触] resulting in property or physical damages. 

> Most states require a motor vehicle owner to carry some minimum level of liability insurance [最低限额保险]. However, some states that don't require the vehicle owner to carry car insurance include Virginia, New Hampshire[新罕布什尔州], and Mississippi.

> When you want to purchase insurance for your car, you might be puzzled as from where you should get it. Are you supposed to deal with an insurance agent [中介] or you should you go online? Below are different features of captive agents [专属代理人], independent agents [独立代理人], or buying online[在线购买], so you can decide on the right path for you.

# 1.Captive /'kæptɪv/ agents
> If you are dedicated to a specific insurance firm [选择某家保险公司], it is advised that you buy your coverage /'kʌvərɪdʒ/ from a captive agent. Because captive agents deal with only one company, they know all the different insurance options offered by that company. Consequently, they can assist you to pick the right package based on your needs. Although, captive agents may take more time [更愿意花时间] in responding to your questions and your needs as compared to other independent agents who work for commission[拿佣金].

# 2. Independent agents
> If you would love to check out the different kinds of insurance provided by different companies, then you should buy a policy from an independent agent, because independent agents usually deal with several companies and not just a particular insurance firm. By doing this, you can get a better rate [拿到更低的价格]: since independent agents are not officially employed by any particular firm, they would not push one specific product [推销某个产品] and will tell you the right things about all the different insurance.

# 3. Buying online
> This option means skipping insurance agents completely and working directly with the company online. However, for this option, you have to do some of the work yourself. You need to conduct thorough research [展开调查] on different car insurance providers, know what they offer, their car insurance rates, and what all their policies cover. Then, you can talk to the company that best fits your needs to procure the coverage itself.

> Buying car insurance online has the advantage of being easy as all you need to do is fill in the registration details of the vehicle [车辆注册信息], provide the address, choose few other factors, click the pay tab, and there it is! A soft copy of your auto insurance policy will be emailed to your inbox, almost instantly.

***Wow, Michelle that’s a sweet ride you’ve got there! Is it new?***

***Thanks, Mike. Yup. I just picked it up from the dealership this morning.***

***It’s pretty flashy. Did you trade in your other car?***

***Yeah, but my last car was quite a lemon, so I didn’t get much for it.***

***Was it easy for you to get financing?***

***Luckily I have good credit, so my interest is only 2.9%.***

***That is a low rate. What are the payments like?***

***Well, it’s fully loaded with all the bells and whistles, so it was pretty pricey, but my payments are reasonable.***

***Which insurance carrier did you end up going with?***

***It was tough to choose. All of the insurance premiums were pretty high because it’s a brand new car. I ended up going with Allstate because they provided $5 million liability covering personal injury, comprehensive, and collision.***

***I was debating between State Farm, Geico, and Allstate, but ended up choosing Liberty Mutual because of the coverage.***

*** I thought about them too. Is your deductible really high?***

***No, it’s only $300.***

***That’s low. Hopefully, you won’t need it, but at least if you do, it won’t break the bank.***
