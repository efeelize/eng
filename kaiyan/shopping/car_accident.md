***Sure do, officer. She totally rear-ended me while I was waiting at the red light.***

***I'm really sorry, there must be a problem with my brakes.***

*** I feel sorry for you: your car is totaled! Luckily, I only have a couple minor dents.***

***Officer, you're going to file a police report that I can give to my insurance company, right?***

***Got it. You're going to need our insurance details too, correct?***

***Yep. Good thing neither of you tried to leave the scene. Otherwise, my job would've been much more difficult.***

***I wouldn't dare think of it.***

***Good to know. Here, I'll get a tow truck and an ambulance down here. We should have some paramedics make sure you two are ok.***
