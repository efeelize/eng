# I.The noticeable age gap in religion
> In the United States, religious congregations /'kɑŋɡrɪɡet/ [宗教集会] have been graying for decades[日渐式微], and young adults are now much less religious than their elders. Recent surveys have found that younger adults are far less likely than older generations to identify with a religion, believe in God or engage in a variety of religious practices. 

> This is not solely an American phenomenon: Lower religious observance among younger adults is common around the world, according to a new analysis. For example, adults younger than 40 are less likely than older adults to say religion is “very important” in their lives [四十岁以上者更倾向于认为宗教在他们的生命中“”非常重要“，而四十岁以下者则不然。] not only in wealthy and relatively secular /'sɛkjəlɚ/  countries [相对世俗的富裕国家] such as Canada, Japan and Switzerland, but also in countries that are less affluent and more religious[较不富裕且宗教气氛浓郁的国家], such as Iran, Poland and Nigeria. 

> Though on the wane /wen/ [vi.变小;衰落] in western Europe and North America, having a faith remains popular worldwide[全世界的各大宗教依然拥有众多信徒]. 84% of the world’s population identifies with a religious group. According to 2015 figures, Christians form the largest religious group, with 2.3 billion [23亿] adherents /əd'hɪrənt/ [n.教众] or 31.2% of the total world population. Next come Muslims (1.8 billion[18亿], or 24.1%), Hindus /ˌhin'du:/ [印度教] (1.1 billion, or 15.1%) and Buddhists /'budist/ [佛教] (500 million, or 6.9%).
