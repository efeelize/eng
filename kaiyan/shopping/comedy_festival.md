# American humor and British humor 
# I.A brief guide to comedy festivals in the U.S.  
> In the U.S, dozens of comedy festivals give comedians in smaller towns their shot [有机会] at connecting with industry types from Los Angeles and New York, and they also can serve as a great networking opportunity for meeting other talents from around the globe. The following are some of the festivals worth a visit.

# 1.Boston Comedy Festival
> Boston is one of the United States’s great stand-up cities[单口喜剧], so it only makes sense that they put on a comedy festival [喜剧节] every year. The festival features hundreds of comedians from around the globe as well as a stand-up and short comedy film competition [喜剧短片] that takes place over four days.[这四天里]

# 2.Black Girl Giggles
> Black Girl Giggles Comedy Festival is organized by Black Girl Giggles, a local comedy collective of African-American women [美籍非裔女性戏剧组织] in comedy who produce a weekly podcast and monthly live shows in addition to their annual festival.

# 3.Seattle International Comedy Competition
> The Seattle International Comedy Competition dubs itself [自称] the “real Last Comic Standing.[《喜剧之王》]” It happens over 26 days[历时26天], includes 22 shows, and features more than 30 international comedians.

# 4.Monty Python [n.巨蟒剧团] & hit and miss [碰巧的；偶然随意]
> Monty python, so like, just like very classic British humor first came out in the 60s.but very famous and very influential, even now. We still talk about Monty python, it was one of the original sketch shows.

> Which is like short little funny, like, scenes and yeah since then, everyone sort of says this was a big influence on that comedy.some people are really big fans of it, other people think just like it wasn't that great.we say it's hit and miss. So when it was good it was very good and then other times you just watching it and thinking why is this funny?This isn't funny.

# II.humor
> Every country has its own brand of jokes and humor. The British are known for sarcasm, irony, and jokes on dark topics. Americans enjoy this type of humor too, but American humor has its own flavor.

# 1.slapstick/physical humor [n.滑稽剧]
> 1)The most common type of American humor is slapstick. Slapstick is physical comedy [肢体喜剧] that laughs at stupid mistakes or clumsy accidents [笨拙的意外]. April Fools’ Day jokes, America’s Funniest Home Videos [《美国家庭滑稽录像》], and Vine videos get laughs using slapstick jokes and pranks.

> 2) slapstick and this is also called like physical humour,when people get hurt it's funny.so slapstick can be like I think of when somebody slips and falls on a banana peel.and the little children laugh, like that mean it just imagine kids watching their dad get hurt and they always laugh. that's slapstick.

# 2.Insult Comedy & Impersonations [冒犯喜剧 & 模仿]
> Insult comedy is another favorite type of American humor. An insult is a joke that criticizes someone’s personality, looks, or behavior to get a laugh. Sometimes insult comedy is harmless, and no one’s feelings get hurt. But, insult comedy can sometimes sound mean.

> Impersonations, like insult comedy, can sometimes seem mean. But not always. Sometimes the person being impersonated finds the jokes funny, too.

# 3.Stand-up comedy [单口喜剧] & observational & comedy festival & stand-up [n.单口喜剧]
> 1)Stand-up comedy is very popular in America. Stand-up comics use many types of jokes. One of the most common is observational humor [观察幽默]. Some of the most popular comedians who use observational humor are: Ellen Degeneres, Jerry Seinfeld, and Louis CK.

> 2)so observational this is like based off of what you see, right, what you observe? so a lot of stand-up comedians doing stand-up comedy, they often use observational humour, they'll talk about like this, like a... so what's the deal with airplane food?

> 3) so that's a lot of stand-up like comedy where they're literally standing up in front of a crowd by themselves making people laugh.so it basically stand up this is one person on a stage and telling all kinds of different jokes and I think I mean I could be wrong but most I feel like most Americans stand-up comedy, at least the kind I like is observational humor. I don't know what.no I think so as well, it's and you know what it's really funny, it's very impressive when somebody can just stand up and make you laugh, it's really smart.

> 4)so this festival is all about comedy. And there's many different types of comedy as we will find out later in the dialogue.

> 5) so we call it stand-up, because usually one person stands up on a stage and they tell a bunch of jokes.they usually talk about things that like culture, strange situations, and they make fun of it.

# 4.improv & improvisational /ˌimprəvai'zeiʃənəl/ [n.即兴表演] & improvise 
> The improv, it's basically when you just make up something on the spot.you don't have any time to prepare it,so, improv, this is short, it comes from the long word.improvisational.and that is from the verb -- improvise, which just means to make something or prepare something like we talked about on the spot.

# 5.sketch comedy [n.短篇喜剧] & on the spot/ on your toes
> 1)a sketch is a short scene like a play. so we just call it a sketch, sketch is also like a little you know drawing that you do.and the really famous TV program that has sketch comedy is called Saturday Night Live.in America SNL. And each sketch is usually like a minute to maybe ten minutes long.

> 2) "on the spot", we also say "on your toes".

# 6.dark humor [n.黑色幽默]
> 1)So dark humor is controversial, sometimes, some people don't like it, because it's basically laughing at things that or maybe not supposed to be laughed at.so basically taking a serious thing.And then somehow making it funny or trying to make it funny.

> 2)like when someone dies at a funeral,now obviously, someone dying is not funny, but dying at a funeral, isn't an irony in there?Which makes it funny, we're not laughing at the guy who dead, we're laughing at the situation.Dark humor done well is very funny. But some people just go that a little bit too far.Sometimes and it's just not funny, it's actually offensive.

# 7.absurd /əb'sɝd/ comdey [n.荒诞作品] & absurd [adj.荒诞的]
> 1)sometimes it's like so ridiculous, it makes no sense and you're just like that is not funny.that's not funny anymore since it's absurd, but here absurd actually is a side of British comedy, there's actually many different types, there's many different facets, sides of British comedy and absurd comedy is one of them,and Monty python for the most part fits into that category.

> 2)absurd :basically it just means something really ridiculous.something so out of the ordinary, so against normality.It's kind of almost hard to believe.like if a guy proposes to the woman he wants to be his wife at a funeral.that's like a really absurd time to propose for marriage.here we give like one more kind of like real world example here, the increase in the price of gas lately has just been absurd.Meaning it's just like such a huge increase, it's crazy, it's ridiculous.we don't understand why the gas company can charge this amount of money.

# 8.American humor & British comedy
> 1)so humor, it's like you have a sense of humor, so your sense of humor tells you what you think or feel is funny. it's like your idea of what is funny.

> 2)So comedy is just like a funny show.So comedy is more like the attempt to make you laugh, comedy has humor in it, but they're not quite the same thing. So comedy is humorous /'hjumərəs/ [adj.富幽默感的].

# III.The unique qualities of British humor
> Many Brits believe that their sense of humour is special, more subtle and more developed [更高级] than that of other nations.

> Oscar Wilde, a popular British playwright [剧作家], once exemplified /ɪɡ'zɛmplɪfaɪ/ [V.例示, 举例证明] this belief by saying, “It is clear that humour is far superior to humor”.[“很明显Humour（英式拼法）比Humor（美式拼法）要高级多了].

# 1.Sarcasm /'sɑrkæzəm/ & satire /'sætaɪɚ/ [n.讽刺手法,讽刺作品] & mocking [v.嘲弄] & ridicule [vt. & n.嘲弄]
> 1)Irony and sarcasm are at the core of British humor. Indeed, many Brits are ready to make a sarcastic comment -- in which they say the opposite of what the really mean -- if there is an opportunity to do so. An example of such dry wit would be to comment on how lovely the weather is when it's actually raining heavily. In the rest of the world, irony is only acceptable at specific times. For the Brits, however, that time is anytime.

> 2)When we're being sarcastic we say the opposite of what we mean and we say it in kind of a different intonation.so this most of the time when you're being sarcastic, you're saying the opposite of what you really think or mean.it's just like, wow the weather is just so great today.But actually cold and raining you know, you are not serious you are just being sarcastic.

> 3)Satire is very popular in UK, it's kind of difficult to describe, but basically it's where you sort of mark or you point out the flaws or shortcomings, especially in people in power or famous people of our society, often we say ridiculous things and the goal really of satire is to point out things that are wrong, and try to show people how we could do it in a better way.if you haven't been to Britain or being in a group of British people, we are actually quite mean to each other.A lot of the time we say horrible things to each other but it's like, it's almost like if you're not saying horrible things that means you don't really like the peron.

> 4)mocking here,  basically making fun of people, so laughing at like shortcomings or unfortunate circumstances.they could be things like that all right down to someone says something a bit silly.

# 2.Understatements [轻描淡写]
> The Brits are also known for frequently making understatements. For example, they might describe something as "not bad" when they actually mean it's "quite good". In fact, British conversations are filled with terms, such as "not quite"[不太], "rather"[不如], "a bit [有点]", and "actually[事实上]", which have a moderating effect  For example, a brit may understate a disastrous situation by using moderating phrases [委婉中立的词] like a "spot of bother[有点伤脑筋]" or "a bit of a pickle[一点小麻烦]".

# 3.Self-deprecation [自嘲]
> Self-deprecation is another unique characteristic of British humor. Instead of parading  /pə'red/ [炫耀] achievements, the Brits tend to focus more on their shortcomings, be overly modest, and put themselves down. The Brits believe that, by downplaying [淡化] their success  through self-mockery [自我嘲弄], they seem more humble and relatable [亲和力].

# 4.innuendo /ˌɪnju'ɛndo/ [n.影射，隐喻] 
> So innuendo, so this is kind of like hinting at something.very subtle, you're not saying clearly what you mean, but if someone is reading your body language and the meaning behind your words.and a lot of times innuendos, they might kind of use metaphors or like you might use one word for a meaning for something else.Basically, and you kind of hint at something, so it's not, it's not basically, it's not very direct.it's very much like British culture, we don't like to be too direct with each other, so there was a lot of innuendo in the things we say to each other, and most British people can pick up on that, because since we were children, we were dealing with innuendo every day.and maybe that's why a lot of people don't get British humor.

# IV.grammar
# 1.Nothing a witty comedian can’t handle & nothing (that) + subject + can’t handle
> 1)“Nothing a witty comedian can’t handle,” referring to the hecklers /ˈh ɛklɚ/ [n.起哄的人]. In this context, it means witty/'wɪti/ [adj. 诙谐的；富于机智的] comedians can handle hecklers because they’re witty. 

> 2)The construction “nothing (that) + subject + can’t handle” means that something is not too difficult for the subject. It’s short for “it’s nothing that...can’t handle.”

- 1. I've got some money problems, but nothing I can't handle. [但是没有什么是我不能解决的] 

- 2. When we work together, there's nothing we can't handle. [就没有解决不了的问题]

> 1)This metaphorical expression is often used to express the deep connection between a specific person (or group of people) and a place, practice, aspect or belief. The metaphor is that they exist within you like the blood that runs in your veins.

> 2)So when we say that something runs in your veins, it just means like it's really a part of who you are.like it's a big part of who they are.so here, him being American, he thinks that being sarcastic or sarcasm is a part of who he is. Like wise Connor is Canadian, so I might think that maple syrup runs in his veins. it might run in, it might actually really run in my veins, because you can eat it.

- 1. A strong work ethic runs in the veins of the people.

- 2. Given his ancestry, you could say the blood of Africa runs in his veins.

- 3. Athleticism runs in my veins.

# 3.prefers...over... & sth you like more than sth else
> 1)It is commonly used in spoken American English to express the preference of one thing to another. When comparing actions, the speaker must use gerund verbs (i.e. running) instead of infinitive verbs (i.e. to run) to use this phrasal pattern correctly.

> 2)to prefer something over something, if we see in the sentence right before, we saw our friend here, Noel, right, he said: I much prefer it to the US version, so you can prefer something to something.

- 1. Tammy prefers rock climbing over swimming.

- 2. I usually prefer warm places over cold places.

- 3. Don't you find it odd that such a young man prefers the quite, countryside life over the hustle and bustle of the big city?

Likewise, concert, you know musical performers, you also have a concert lineup, you know all my favorite bands will be there.Yeah, like if I want to know who's playing at the concert or who's going to be at the comedy night, I'll ask this question: who's in the lineup?

# 4.punchline [n.梗]
> so like punchline is kind of like a phrase, like sums up the joke.it's like the last part, so you're telling a joke and the last part of the joke, when it makes everybody laugh, that's the punchline.most jokes especially when you tell somebody a joke, like comedy on TV might be different, but like if you're like telling somebody a joke: Hey!

> 1)comedians are really smart, they can make fun of the hecklers because they're very witty.so, basically, if you're witty, we say that you're quick thinking, and usually witty people are funny.

> 2)so hopefully, the wit will overcome the heckling, and the comedian will prevail.the best way to respond to hecklers is with wit.

> 3)dry wit stuff is a bit too subdued.Dry wit is like what many think is classic British humor.we will say something that is funny but we don't act like it's funny.so you'll say something that actually is funny, but you say in a very serious ways.so like people might even think that you're being serious, but it just comes off as very laughable.

> 2) if something is your cup of tea that means you like it, thing is not your cup of tea, you don't like it.so this is not my cup of tea, basically meaning I don't enjoy it.
