# Comedy festival 
# I.A brief guide to comedy festivals in the U.S.  
> In the U.S, dozens of comedy festivals give comedians in smaller towns their shot [有机会] at connecting with industry types from Los Angeles and New York, and they also can serve as a great networking opportunity for meeting other talents from around the globe. The following are some of the festivals worth a visit.

# 1.Boston Comedy Festival
> Boston is one of the United States’s great stand-up cities[单口喜剧], so it only makes sense that they put on a comedy festival [喜剧节] every year. The festival features hundreds of comedians from around the globe as well as a stand-up and short comedy film competition [喜剧短片] that takes place over four days.[这四天里]

# 2.Black Girl Giggles
> Black Girl Giggles Comedy Festival is organized by Black Girl Giggles, a local comedy collective of African-American women [美籍非裔女性戏剧组织] in comedy who produce a weekly podcast and monthly live shows in addition to their annual festival.

# 3.Seattle International Comedy Competition
> The Seattle International Comedy Competition dubs itself [自称] the “real Last Comic Standing.[《喜剧之王》]” It happens over 26 days[历时26天], includes 22 shows, and features more than 30 international comedians.

# II.grammar
# 1.Nothing a witty comedian can’t handle & nothing (that) + subject + can’t handle
> 1)“Nothing a witty comedian can’t handle,” referring to the hecklers /ˈh ɛklɚ/ [n.起哄的人]. In this context, it means witty/'wɪti/ [adj. 诙谐的；富于机智的] comedians can handle hecklers because they’re witty. 

> 2)The construction “nothing (that) + subject + can’t handle” means that something is not too difficult for the subject. It’s short for “it’s nothing that...can’t handle.”

- 1. I've got some money problems, but nothing I can't handle. [但是没有什么是我不能解决的] 

- 2. When we work together, there's nothing we can't handle. [就没有解决不了的问题] 

- 3. A: I heard the test will be really hard. B: It's nothing you can't handle with a bit of studying.[只要你学了就没什么难的]

# 2.comedy festival & stand-up [n.单口喜剧] & improv & improvisational /ˌimprəvai'zeiʃənəl/ [n.即兴表演] & improvise & sketch comedy [n.短篇喜剧] & on the spot/ on your toes
> 1)so this festival is all about comedy. And there's many different types of comedy as we will find out later in the dialogue.

> 2) so we call it stand-up, because usually one person stands up on a stage and they tell a bunch of jokes.they usually talk about things that like culture, strange situations, and they make fun of it.

> 3)The improv, it's basically when you just make up something on the spot.you don't have any time to prepare it,so, improv, this is short, it comes from the long word.improvisational.and that is from the verb -- improvise, which just means to make something or prepare something like we talked about on the spot.

> 4)a sketch is a short scene like a play. so we just call it a sketch, sketch is also like a little you know drawing that you do.and the really famous TV program that has sketch comedy is called Saturday Night Live.in America SNL. And each sketch is usually like a minute to maybe ten minutes long.

> 5) "on the spot", we also say "on your toes".

# 3.lineup [n.演出阵容] & comedians [n.喜剧演员] & hecklers /ˈh ɛklɚ/ [n.起哄者] & witty /'wɪti/ [adj.诙谐的;富于机智的]
> 1)if any of you guys have ever been to New York City, you will see tons and tons of street performers, so we're not looking at street performers today, we are at a comedy festival and we want to know who is in the lineup.in this case, we're not talking about a lineup like at a busy restaurant waiting to get in, this is the list of performers.if you go to a concert. Likewise, concert, you know musical performers, you also have a concert lineup, you know all my favorite bands will be there.Yeah, like if I want to know who's playing at the concert or who's going to be at the comedy night, I'll ask this question: who's in the lineup?

> 2)somebody who does comedy, so someone who does stand-up, you call them a stand-up comedian.

> 3)so a heckler is just someone who tries to distract the comedian, because the comedian, they're up there and they're trying to give their performance. But a heckler will "Eh, what are you doing? Blabla..." You know, and they try to distract them, so the comedian messes up.

> 4)comedians, they're really smart, they can make fun of the hecklers because they're very witty.so, basically, if you're witty, we say that you're quick thinking, right, and usually witty people are funny.

> 5)so hopefully, the wit will overcome the heckling, and the comedian will prevail.the best way to respond to hecklers is with wit.

# 4.recycle [n.重复使用]
> recycle, it means to use again, like we don't just throw our pop cans into the garbage, we recycle them.we don't just throw our soda cans away, plastic bags, things like that, we recycle and we reuse, but here recycling is talking about, well, recycling old jokes.

# 5.the butt of a joke
> the butt of a joke, that means you are the subject of the joke.so if you are the butt of a joke, that means they are making fun of you.
