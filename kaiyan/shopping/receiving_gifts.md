# I.Western Gift Giving Culture
> In Western gift giving culture, it is customary /'kʌstə'mɛri/ [adj.习惯上的] to give a gift that reflects[反映] knowledge of the recipient's personal tastes, interests or character. Upon receiving a gift that is concealed /kən'sil/ by wrapping paper or some other sort of packaging[有包装的礼物], more often than not[更多的情况是], the recipient will immediately open it in front of the giver to express their gratitude. 

> When it comes to business relationships[有业务往来的时候], gifts are typically not seen as mandatory /'mændətɔri/ [adj.强制的] in the West. Moreover, when giving a gift to a business partner from another culture, it is a good idea to give something that is representative of your culture, a bit hard to find and not taboo in the recipient's homeland. 

> The gift should reflect your understanding of the recipient’s culture and the value you place on the relationship. By taking time to research the traditions and customs of the recipient’s homeland, you will avoid unintentional embarrassment /ɪm'bærəsmənt/ or offense.
