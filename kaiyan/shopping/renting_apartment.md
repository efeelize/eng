# Renting apartment
# I.Tips for an efficient apartment search
> When you're apartment hunting [找房子], there are certain amenities /ə'mɛnəti/ [n.便利设施] that you probably look for. That checklist of things means you might have to see multiple apartments before finding the right one. Here's how to have the most efficient and effective apartment search:

# 1.Set a budget range [预算范围]
> Sit down and figure out what you can afford per month, taking into consideration other expenses. When you have a set range in mind, you won't put yourself in the situation of considering an apartment that's way beyond what you can afford.[你就不会花时间考虑一间费用远远超出你承受范围的公寓]

# 2. Consider time of year
> The time of year that you search for an apartment can have an impact on what you end up paying for rent. The prices in summer months will be much higher than other months because that's the time that many people look for a place. If time isn't a factor in your search, it may be best to find an apartment during October through December or February through March.
	
# 3. Narrow down your search
> The great thing about the Internet is that you can do the majority of your apartment search without even leaving your home. Pick out three or four apartments that are worth the trip; then schedule an in-person visit.[然后安排时间亲自去看一下]

# II.Apartment Furnishings [全配公寓]
> When apartment hunting in China, most places will come fully furnished, and many others are at least semi-furnished. In America, apartments usually come unfurnished. Sometimes it comes partially or fully furnished, but this is usually when you are renting a room in someone's house, for example. Bigger appliances [n.大的家电] like the refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave will be included. Some units will include a washer/dryer as well, whereas other places will have a separate room full of washing machines and dryers for the whole complex.

> So how do Americans furnish these empty apartments? For many, IKEA is the go-to brand [很多人就去宜家]. Not only are products packaged flat[放平打包], which makes for easier transportation, they carry a wide variety, and their prices are among the most affordable. Those who have already been living on their own [自立的人] will usually rent a storage truck [运输卡车] to move their current furniture to their new apartment when they change jobs or relocate to a different city.

# III.Apartment Hunting in America
> Craigslist, an online classified ads website [网上分类广告网], is one of the go-to sources for apartment listings[找房子就去这个网站]. This would be equivalent /ɪ'kwɪvələnt/ to China's 58.com. There are plenty of other websites, such as apartments.com and zillow.com. Some Americans will also hunt in person, by going to an area they want to live in, then finding nearby apartments.

> While it's commonplace /'kɑmən'ples/ [adj.普通的,平庸的] to hire an agent or agency to find an apartment in China, Americans normally don't, and usually only hire a real estate agent when looking to buy a house. Some do though [有些人确实找中介], and apartment locators earn about one month's pay in commission after the lease has been signed[得到差不多一个月租金的佣金]. Monthly rent usually does not include utilities[水电费], and the security deposit is about two months' rent.

# IV.What a Landlord is responsible for
> Basically, the landlord of a rental unit is responsible for providing a "habitable" [宜居] unit for a tenant. The term "habitable" means that the rental unit must be fit to live in, be free from hazards or defects [缺陷和潜在危险], and be compliant [符合] with all state and local building and health codes.

> A landlord has a duty to provide the amenities that are essential to maintaining the tenant's living requirements [承担维修房屋所有缺陷的责任]. Thus, if a defect in a building affects a tenant, a landlord may be liable for damages suffered by the tenant.

> Although landlords are primarily responsible for ensuring the habitability of the rental unit, both landlords and tenants are responsible for certain repairs.[该损害是由租户造成的，房东不用承担相应责任]

# V.grammar
# 1.per se /pɜːr'sei/ & we don't hate it per se
> 1)You probably already know that a lot of English (and indeed other European languages) comes from Latin. Some phrases are very academic or scientific [有些短语非常学术或科学性很强], but other phrases are still used in everyday speech. "Per se" is one of those phrases. it basically means "by/of itself". 

> 2)It's usually used in a negative construction.[否定结构]so we do often use this phrase when we're giving our opinion on something, like we don't hate it per se.

- 1. I don't think what he did was illegal per se, but it certainly looks bad.

- 2. It's not money per se that makes people happy. It's the things that money can buy.

- 3. The job isn't interesting per se, but it puts me in contact with lots of interesting people.

- 4.I don't hate the color of the walls per se, but I hate the combination of the walls and the furniture.

- 5.the job isn't interesting per se, but it puts me in contact with lots of interesting people.

# 2.check everything off [phr.核对每一样东西] & put you in contact with
> 1)so basically when you think about a list, you know, people usually have a list of things that they want from the apartment. And when you get these things done, you can check them off, you put a little check mark beside it.you can check them off, you can cross them out with a line.so once you have done what you need to do, you can say oh you can check it off the list.

> 2) it's a great phrase to use when you're at work. So I could say I can put you in contact with someone.

# 3.decent [adj.很不错的] & top-of-the-line [adj.顶级的] & junior [adj.初级的、小的] & handy [adj.实用的]
> 1)so decent just means that, you know, it's not great, but it's not bad, it's alright.It's, yeah pretty good. May I use this word all the time? Just, you know, how are you feeling? Hmm, decent, it's a decent day,or maybe you have a decent job.

> 2)This is a great phrase to say, you know, the best of the best.

> 3)> 1)junior here is a great word, because I'm sure you guys know this at work, seniors, like senior management, there are your juniors at work. A person if, for example, if I have a son and name him Adam, then he will actually be called Adam Junior.

> 4)But here we're talking about size.and sometimes you'll see this related to size, actually when you go to a burger joint.get a junior burger.For the people with that smaller appetites.

> 5)So this is a great word, a very colloquial /kə'lokwɪəl/ way to say it's very convenient or useful.Or useful right. So something that would be handy. Well, money is pretty handy.Yeah, smartphones are amazingly handy. 

# 4.adamant /'ædəmənt/ [adj.固执的] & stubborn & preferably /ˈpr ɛfərəblɪ/ [adv.宁可]
> 1)But adamant is more like, it could be principled for example.An adamant person. I would say that I'm adamant about certain things. Like for example, in this dialogue, Tim is very adamant about having a gym in the building. I'm not really adamant about that, which means that I'm not insisting on that, I refuse to accept that there is no gym, I'm not really like that.some people are really adamant about things in their apartment, like they really want them and they're not willing to give it up. 

> 2)stubborn makes me just think of my dad right? Like you know I don't want to change. it's kind of like their personality right? That's dumb, that's new, that's stupid. 

> 3)preferably,it means would rather.

# 5.tight market [n.紧俏的市场] & on the market [可以获得,有供应量]
> 1)so tight market is basically when you have a lot of people who want this product or thing, but you don't have enough of it.There is a lot of demand and not enough supply.

> 2)On the market means available. In addition to describing housing for rent or for sale, it can also mean the literal /'lɪtərəl/ market of goods. Another way we commonly use this phrase is to describe someone's single or taken dating status.if you're on the market right? That means usually, romantically, no dating.Maybe you just broke up with your boyfriend, so now you're on the market.

- 1. After her divorce, it felt strange to be on the market again. [又能重新找对象的感觉有点怪] 

- 2. It seems like there are so many fake goods on the market these days. [市场上假货很多]

- 3. He’s such a handsome guy. He won’t stay on the market for long.[他不会单身太久的]

# 6.deposit [n.保证金] & damage deposit & rent up front [phr.预付租金] & upfront & budget [n.预算] 
> 1)So deposit, of course it's the thing that you need to pay first before you move in.And it's usually to protect the owner, so if you suddenly cancel or let's say you damage the building, then they take that deposit.

> 2)That's interesting, because we also see a little chunk here at the end of the sentence, damage deposit. So you'll hear things like security deposit, damage deposit, but just deposit here, honestly, it's going to depend on where you live, like generally speaking here, a deposit is first and last month's rent plus.

> 3)when we use up front as an adverb, like for example, pay up front or in this case, need up front, it is usually 2 words, So up front just basically means first.In advance, 

> 4)but as an adjective, we just kind of put them together into one word.it can also have a different meaning. So for example, I could say the owner of the apartment could be really up front about the problems in this apartment.So up front here is basically just very honest, putting all the information up front.it's like saying it directly.

> 5)the way she asks, I think it's really, it's kind of softer. What kind of budget do you have in mind?Instead of asking what is your budget.

# 7.sublet /ˌsʌb'lɛt/ [n.转租] & lease & tenants [n.房客] & landlord [n.房东]
> 1)so a sublet is when you have a renter who rents to another person.So here's another fun part about the word rent, you can rent from someone or you can rent out to someone.

> 2)Lease is both a noun and a verb. The noun refers to the contract that binds you to whatever you are renting for a period of time[租赁期限], whether that's a car, an apartment, or equipment. The verb, however, is not so straightforward [直接]. In terms of property [拿房产来说], the landlord is the one that leases to the tenant. In terms of cars [但如果是车], the driver would lease a car, usually by the month.

- 1. The one-year apartment lease I just signed required a two month deposit. [一年公寓租约]

- 2. He can never make up his mind about what car he wants, so he usually leases a new one every three months. [每过三个月就租一辆新的]

- 3. She plans on leasing out her old house [把老房子租出去] since she just bought a new one.

> 3)So tenants is basically someone who rents a property. The person that lives there. He rents and lives there. 

> 4)So the landlord owns the property.

# 8.walk through [n.看房] & open house & listing [n.挂牌房屋、在售房屋] & rentals [n.出租房] & walk-in closet 
> 1)So walk-through is just, well, if you're walking through the apartment, looking at it?So in addition to walk-through, I think some really common terms are viewing or open house.But for apartments, it's probably going to be walk-through. Because usually it's very quick.For here's the bathroom, here is the room, here is the living room.

> 2)Open house is usually, that's when you're buying something,buying a house usually.

> 3)so listing here,I would say it’s a description of something being sold.

> 4)So rentals is just the things that you can rent.Temporary housing I would say. Could be a house, could be an apartment, could be anything, it's all rentals.You could rent a car, car rentals.

> 5)so this is just a very big closet that you can walk into.So pretty useful if you've got a lot of clothes and shoes and other stuff that goes in the closet. Since I don't really have a lot of those things. I'm more interested in the next one.

# 9.agency & agent 
> I think agent, agent is the person and agency is the place where they work.So if you go to an agency, a rental agency, you will talk to a rental agent.

# 10.facility [n.设施] & 24-hour security [n.保安] & amenities /ə'mɛnəti/ [n.设施] & fully-furnished [adj.家具全配的] & open kitchen & appliance [n.家用电器]
> 1)So here I think the facilities are usually communal /'kɑmjʊnl/ [adj.公共的], but within the complex or the apartment.so we just mentioned some facilities would be features that are included in the complex.As part of the package. So if we have some nearby grocery stores or schools, they wouldn't really be considered facilities. I mean some, some buildings have a supermarket inside, and maybe the agent could say that this is a facility. 

> 2)But the school, no. Generally speaking guys, if it's outside of the apartment, of the building, or maybe of the complex, it's not part of the facilities.

> 3)So let's quickly go back to this 24-hour security.Maybe some security cameras, maybe surveillance /sɝ'veləns/ [n. 盯梢,监视] .so all of those things in English, those, they're all security. I would just say there is 24-hour security. It's all of those things, it's the guy, or the girl, the doorman maybe, cameras, cards. They're all security. 

> 4) so amenities, these things are like, you know, swimming pool, hot tub, gym, anything like that.like hotels also have amenities .And actually a lot of the times, they're just things that improve your life.

> 5) so fully-furnished comes with furniture.a bed,sofa,tables,some chairs.

> 6) You can also say a person is handy though,So they are like they can fix a lot of stuff, they're very handy.

> 7)So it seems the apartment comes with an open kitchen as well as lots of top-of-the-line appliances.so open kitchen just means no doors. So it's usually, there's lots of space to cook food, cut vegetables, all the fun things you do in the kitchen.

> 8)Appliances, these would usually be, you know, the electronic household equipment that we use to, you know, do all these household chores or tasks.So like a washing machine to wash your clothes.And here they have a refrigerator, a new fridge and an oven and a dishwasher.so those are probably the most common appliances that you can see inside of a home or a apartment.

# 11.layout [n.布局] & south-facing [adj.朝南的] & master bedroom [n.主卧室] & ensuite /swiːt/ [adj.成套的] & junior studio /'studɪo/ [n.一室户] & unit [n.房间] & flex space [n.弹性空间] & balcony /'bælkəni/ [n.阳台] 
> 1)So this word layout really just means the way the room is set up.

> 2)south-facing or north-facing or east-facing or west-facing, this is just another way to say that the apartment faces the south or north or east or west. And the good thing about south-facing is that you're not gonna get too much sunlight in the morning, and you're not gonna get too much sunlight in the evening.

> 3) So the master bedroom is gonna be bigger with more features.

> 4)So the ensuite bathroom.So this just means you have a bathroom in the room. You don't have to share a bathroom with another person. You've got the bathroom right there.

> 5)And when we go and check into the hotel, for example, one of the rooms that you can check into is ensuite.Yes, so this is a very big room usually includes a living room as well as the bedroom, probably a sofa in there, bunch of tables.

> 6)A studio apartment is basically like not necessarily one room, but there's no bedroom.so your kitchen, your living room, your bedroom is all one room.It's all one room. And it can be big, like there can be lots of space in there, but there is just no separation, there's no wall.if you're a bachelor, if you're unmarried or I think if they don't have kids, that's fine. But this is a junior studio.So that means it's even less like a one-bedroom, because a junior studio here just means a small studio.

> 7) So unit is usually an apartment. You would never call a house a unit,. But you know, here he wants to rent a 2 bedroom apartment or unit.so unit is basically that you know, kitchen, the room, the bathroom, this is a whole unit.It's the apartment.But maybe you are renting out of a house, a house can have many different units in it. so actually at my place, there are 5 units.

> 8) flex is just short for flexible.So it means that you can do many different things in this space.what do you do when you're in flex space?We actually have some exercise equipment. Yes, and it's also a storage place. I think that's pretty common right? A lot of people exercise in their flex space, but just as many people just kind of put their stuff in it.

> 9) The balcony is usually partially outdoors or has, you know, a great view of the outdoors at least. And this is where most people that I've come across will dry their clothes. It's got great air ventilation /ˌvɛntl'eʃən/ [n.空气流通], and will dry your clothes pretty fast.so balconies are great, like a little bit outside the apartment, where you have like a great view of maybe the city or whatever is around you.

# 12.send (over) sb
> 1)You can use this when you’re talking about sending a person to do some work, and also when you want to talk about sending a document like an email.

> 2)But adding “over” to “send” makes the sentence sound more casual and friendly. It also makes it sound like less of a big deal: the person coming to fix your toilet likely won’t be there for very long. That’s why you probably wouldn’t get sent “over” to Paris. It’s too far, and likely won’t be a quick trip.

> 3)So send somebody somewhere, that's not anything crazy. But when we add this word over, it kind of changes the meaning a little bit.Like it does mean over there or to that place, but it kind of gives it a more casual sense like it's not a big deal, we're not going very far.And it won't take very long.like I probably wouldn't say I'm gonna go over to Paris.

- 1. I'm going to head over to Jim's place and see if he's got any batteries I can borrow. 

- 2. Okay, I'll send over an email with all the details this afternoon. 

- 3. Could you send someone over tomorrow morning around 10:00?

# 13.did I catch you at a bad time & Can I talk to you now?
> This is a really great expression, it's pretty casual, it it's very polite, it just means can I talk to you. so we we don't say: Is it convenient now? We might say: Can I talk to you now? But this is just a really casual great phrase.

# 14.chemicals [n.化学药品] & substance 
> 1)so chemicals of course can mean almost anything. In this case, these chemicals have one purpose which is to kill the strong brother--the cockroach in the kitchen.and maybe clean the kitchen too. 

> 2)And it's interesting these days, a lot of people are using more natural products, because they say it doesn't have any chemicals in it.

# 15.cockroach /'kɑk'rotʃ/ [n.蟑螂] & neat and tidy [phr.干净整洁]
> 1)They are like kind of the toughest insect in the world. They're everywhere, they're fast, exactly. Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night to have a glass of water, turn on the light and there're cockroaches on the floor...

> 2)Neat and tidy. So first of all we have this word neat, neat, it basically means not messy, right? And the thing is tidy kind of has the same meaning.Yeah, they're really really similar and that's why we put them in a chunk, like this neat and tidy. I don't want you to leave that room until it's neat and tidy. that's kind of how we say this, we just say them together, it's always neat and tidy.
