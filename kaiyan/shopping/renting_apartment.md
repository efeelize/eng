# Renting apartment
# I.Tips for an efficient apartment search
> When you're apartment hunting [找房子], there are certain amenities /ə'mɛnəti/ [n.便利设施] that you probably look for. That checklist of things means you might have to see multiple apartments before finding the right one. Here's how to have the most efficient and effective apartment search:

# 1.Set a budget range [预算范围]
> Sit down and figure out what you can afford per month, taking into consideration other expenses. When you have a set range in mind, you won't put yourself in the situation of considering an apartment that's way beyond what you can afford.[你就不会花时间考虑一间费用远远超出你承受范围的公寓]

# 2. Consider time of year
> The time of year that you search for an apartment can have an impact on what you end up paying for rent. The prices in summer months will be much higher than other months because that's the time that many people look for a place. If time isn't a factor in your search, it may be best to find an apartment during October through December or February through March.

# 3. Narrow down your search
> The great thing about the Internet is that you can do the majority of your apartment search without even leaving your home. Pick out three or four apartments that are worth the trip; then schedule an in-person visit.[然后安排时间亲自去看一下。]

# II.grammar
# 1.per se /pɜːr'sei/ & we don't hate it per se
> 1)You probably already know that a lot of English (and indeed other European languages) comes from Latin. Some phrases are very academic or scientific [有些短语非常学术或科学性很强], but other phrases are still used in everyday speech. "Per se" is one of those phrases. it basically means "by/of itself". 

> 2)It's usually used in a negative construction.[否定结构]so we do often use this phrase when we're giving our opinion on something, like we don't hate it per se.

- 1. I don't think what he did was illegal per se, but it certainly looks bad.

- 2. It's not money per se that makes people happy. It's the things that money can buy.

- 3. The job isn't interesting per se, but it puts me in contact with lots of interesting people.

- 4.I don't hate the color of the walls per se, but I hate the combination of the walls and the furniture.

- 5.the job isn't interesting per se, but it puts me in contact with lots of interesting people.

# 2.check everything off [phr.核对每一样东西] & put you in contact with
> 1)so basically when you think about a list, you know, people usually have a list of things that they want from the apartment. And when you get these things done, you can check them off, you put a little check mark beside it.you can check them off, you can cross them out with a line.so once you have done what you need to do, you can say oh you can check it off the list.

> 2) it's a great phrase to use when you're at work. So I could say I can put you in contact with someone.

# 3.decent [adj.很不错的]
> so decent just means that, you know, it's not great, but it's not bad, it's alright.It's, yeah pretty good. May I use this word all the time? Just, you know, how are you feeling? Hmm, decent, it's a decent day,or maybe you have a decent job.

# 4.junior studio /'studɪo/ [n.一室户] & unit [n.房间] & flex space [n.弹性空间] & balcony /'bælkəni/ [n.阳台]
> 1)A studio apartment is basically like not necessarily one room, but there's no bedroom.so your kitchen, your living room, your bedroom is all one room.It's all one room. And it can be big, like there can be lots of space in there, but there is just no separation, there's no wall.if you're a bachelor, if you're unmarried or I think if they don't have kids, that's fine. But this is a junior studio.So that means it's even less like a one-bedroom, because a junior studio here just means a small studio.

> 2) so unit is basically that you know, kitchen, the room, the bathroom, this is a whole unit.It's the apartment.But maybe you are renting out of a house, a house can have many different units in it. so actually at my place, there are 5 units.

> 3) flex is just short for flexible.So it means that you can do many different things in this space.what do you do when you're in flex space?We actually have some exercise equipment. Yes, and it's also a storage place. I think that's pretty common right? A lot of people exercise in their flex space, but just as many people just kind of put their stuff in it.

> 4) so balconies are great, you know, that's the part, like a little bit outside the apartment, where you have like a great view of maybe the city or whatever is around you.

# 5.junior [adj.初级的、小的]
> 1)junior here is a great word, because I'm sure you guys know this at work, seniors, like senior management, there are your juniors at work. A person if, for example, if I have a son and name him Adam, then he will actually be called Adam Junior.

> 2)But here we're talking about size.and sometimes you'll see this related to size, actually when you go to a burger joint.get a junior burger.For the people with that smaller appetites.

# 6.south-facing [adj.朝南的] & amenities /ə'mɛnəti/  [n.设施]
> 1)south-facing or north-facing or east-facing or west-facing, this is just another way to say that the apartment faces the south or north or east or west. And the good thing about south-facing is that you're not gonna get too much sunlight in the morning, and you're not gonna get too much sunlight in the evening.

> 2) so amenities, these things are like, you know, swimming pool, hot tub, gym, anything like that.like hotels also have amenities .And actually a lot of the times, they're just things that improve your life.

# 7.adamant /'ædəmənt/ [adj.固执的] & stubborn 
> 1)But adamant is more like, it could be principled for example.An adamant person. I would say that I'm adamant about certain things. Like for example, in this dialogue, Tim is very adamant about having a gym in the building. I'm not really adamant about that, which means that I'm not insisting on that, I refuse to accept that there is no gym, I'm not really like that.some people are really adamant about things in their apartment, like they really want them and they're not willing to give it up. 

> 2)stubborn makes me just think of my dad right? Like you know I don't want to change. it's kind of like their personality right? That's dumb, that's new, that's stupid. 

# 8.tight market [n.紧俏的市场]
> so tight market is basically when you have a lot of people who want this product or thing, but you don't have enough of it.There is a lot of demand and not enough supply.

# 9.deposit [n.保证金] & damage deposit & rent up front [phr.预付租金] & upfront 
> 1)So deposit, of course it's the thing that you need to pay first before you move in.And it's usually to protect the owner, so if you suddenly cancel or let's say you damage the building, then they take that deposit.

> 2)That's interesting, because we also see a little chunk here at the end of the sentence, damage deposit. So you'll hear things like security deposit, damage deposit, but just deposit here, honestly, it's going to depend on where you live, like generally speaking here, a deposit is first and last month's rent plus.

> 3)when we use up front as an adverb, like for example, pay up front or in this case, need up front, it is usually 2 words, So up front just basically means first.In advance, 

> 4)but as an adjective, we just kind of put them together into one word.it can also have a different meaning. So for example, I could say the owner of the apartment could be really up front about the problems in this apartment.So up front here is basically just very honest, putting all the information up front.it's like saying it directly.

# 10.sublet /ˌsʌb'lɛt/ [n.转租]
> so a sublet is when you have a renter who rents to another person.So here's another fun part about the word rent, you can rent from someone or you can rent out to someone.

# III.pattern
***Alright, Tim, I wasn't able to check everything off your list, but I think we found a pretty decent apartment for you.***

***Okay. It is a one-bedroom though, right?***

***Well, not exactly. It's a junior studio. But the unit has an incredible flex space!***

***I see. Is there a balcony?***

***There isn't a balcony, but the apartment is south-facing, so you'll get the perfect amount of sunlight.***

***And how about amenities? I'm pretty adamant about having a gym in the building.***

***Well there isn't a gym per se. But there is a party room, and I know some people do yoga in there sometimes.***

***Hmm. I can't really say this is ideal, but since this is such a tight market, I might not have any choice.***

***Great! So in terms of a deposit, we're going to need two months rent up front, plus a cleaning fee, and a damage deposit as well.***

***That shouldn't be too much trouble. Wait, the apartment is furnished, right?***

***Oh, no it's unfurnished. But we'll be happy to put you in contact with a furniture rental place.***

***You know, I saw a sublet online that I think I'll take. Thanks for your help though!***
