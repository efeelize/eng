# I.Men at mall
> We've all seen the boyfriends scrolling /skrol/ [n. 卷[滚]动，上下换行] on their phones with a mountain of shopping bags on either side of them, the husbands taking naps anywhere they can sit down. They're clearly not as interested in retail /'ritel/ [n. 零售] therapy as their female counterparts. 

> In a recent study of 2000 British men, it takes an average of just 26 minutes for men to get bored of shopping, while it takes about two hours for women to get equally bored. Research conducted at the Wharton School suggests that men are more goal-oriented when they shop, whereas women like to take their time to savor /'seivə/ [vt.尽情享受] the experience.

> Of course, these findings don't apply to everyone. There are women out there who have to be dragged by their boyfriends or husbands to the mall. There are men who love shopping and trying on clothes. Let us know which category you fall under, how you like to shop, and whom with!
