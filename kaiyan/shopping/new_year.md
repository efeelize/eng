# II.spring festival taboos
> With Spring Festival just around the corner, it's time to start planning all those fun activities. I'm sure that a lot of you have some family traditions, but you might also have a few Spring Festival taboos /tə'bu:z/. What are these? Well, they're things you're not supposed to do around this time of year!

# 1.cleaning or sweeping 
> First on our list is to avoid housework. Before the Spring Festival, there's a day of cleaning. This is to sweep away the bad luck. But during the actual celebration, it becomes taboo. Cleaning or throwing away garbage may wash away your wealth for the coming year.If you must sweep, start from the outside and sweep everything into the middle of the room. This symbolizes collecting wealth.

# 2.eating porridge
> Number two has to do with our first meal of the new year. Some people believe that eating porridge for breakfast will bring bad fortune. I myself love a bowl of porridge in the morning, no matter the occasion, so I don't follow this belief. But if you want to stick with tradition, cook up some dumplings instead.

# 3.breaking dishes
> Next up, it's believed that breaking things will break your connection with prosperity and fortune. If you happen to break something, wrap /ræp/ it in red paper while repeating auspicious /ɔ'spɪʃəs/ [adj.吉祥的] words or phrases. After the new year, throw the wrapped objects into a lake or river. This will reverse /rɪ'vɝs/ [v.反转]your misfortune.

# 4.giving the wrong gifts
> OK, last but not least, there's gift giving. Many people bring gifts when they pay a visit to family and friends. However, bringing the wrong gift can bring bad luck to both you and the recipient. With the red envelopes[n.红包], make sure you don't give an odd amount of lucky money. It's best to give even amounts, unless it contains the number four.Also,borrowing or lending money at this time is taboo.

> Well, there you have it. These rules may seem excessive /ɪkˈsɛsɪv/ [adj.过度的] during the Spring Festival. Especially when you add the other customs that come with this holiday. But like most things, it's better to be safe than sorry. 

# III.Gifts on a budget 
> If you’re buying gifts for family members on a budget, or you have a big family, here are some ways from Time.com that can help you be more frugal /'fruɡl/ [adj.节俭的] during the holiday season.

# 1.Cut Out the Adults 
> Only exchange gifts for the kids. You can save more than $200 this way, and the adults will be happy that their kids are happy.

# 2.Rotate /'rotet/ [vt.使旋转] Recipients
> Rotate between the four siblings /'sibliŋz/  and their families[轮着给兄弟姐妹和他们的家庭买礼物]. It’s fair and it makes the gift-giving more meaningful.  

# 3.Agree to Get Crafty /'kræfti/ [adj. 灵巧的] {原创礼物}
> Do homemade gifts, like a photo album. Not only are they fun, the recipient will appreciate it even more.

# 4. Focus on Experiences
> Consider giving experience gifts—whether[可以考虑赠送体验性质的礼物] that means buying tickets for a ball game or making plans to take the kids to a matinee /ˌmætn'e/ [n.戏票]movie.

# 5. Pick One and Be Done [挑一个人送礼物]
> Rather than try to spend $50 on everyone in each family—which would total $500—pick one name to buy for[取而代之的是挑一个人赠送单价更高的礼物], with a set price range of $100 to $150 per person.

# IV.grammar
# 1.for that matter [phr.这样说来]
> Haha...Yeah it does sound a little bit more formal. It kind of has this feeling like, like you said either.The phrase “for that matter” is used to show that some new statement is just as true as the previous statement. In most cases, it's used to expand the previous statement to include more.[告诉读者，接下来要做的新的陈述跟之前的表述一样正确。大多数情况下，这个短语用来给前一个陈述增加一些内容。]Yeah for sure. Like for example, "Have you, Adam, ever been to Kenya?I have never been to Kenya, I actually, I've never been to Africa for that matter.

- I didn't see her at the party.I don't think anybody saw her for that matter.
- She doesn't like beer,or any alcohol for that matter.
- My husband didn't sleep well last night.He hasn't slept well all week for that matter.

# 2.delivery [n.快递] & delivering [vt.] & deliver & carrier 
> 1)Yeah, for sure. I noticed this around Christmas I saw delivery trucks everywhere.Delivery guy,pizza guy,there're lots of delivery girls here too but, I guess I don't really see delivery person.Or just I mean again, if it is someone delivering packages you can call them a carrier.

> 2)So you guys will probably know this as both delivering food and delivering packages.

> 3)So we know "deliver" this word, like to bring or to take something somewhere.

# 3.last-minute [adj.最后时刻的] & last second & crammer 
> 1)Yeah it's really kind of late, a late time to be getting presents. Uh, or we also say this if you're studying for a test.Right crammer /'kræmɚ/ [n.为应试而死记硬背的人], last-minute study.

> 2)Yeah last second. I mean that's even more intense.

# 4.red envelope  & red packets & red pockets & lucky money [n.红包]
> 1)Probably Americans say envelope /ˈɛnvəˌlop/ , British people say envelope /'envələʊp/

> 2)A packet /'pækɪt/ [n.小包] could be like an envelope, right?No pocket only happens in like uh, pants, or a backpack[双肩包].Yeah exactly. So if you really want to use that word it could be red packet. 

> I always say lucky money. I think lucky money is the best one.

# 5.relatives
> 1)Yeah it's your family. Now it's not just your sister, brother or mother or father, it could also be your cousin right?

# 6.awkward & embarrassed
> So this word awkward it's sort of just like embarrassed or kind of nervous almost.Now one thing I love about this word is all of the other words that it always teams up with, that it always joins together with like awkward moment.Yeah many people don't you know, don't like awkward silences and it's when no one can think of what to say.Right you are talking with like a group of people after five minutes nobody's talking.And someone as soon as you open your mouth, someone else is going to open their mouth. And you're talking over each other and then it's more awkward.

# 7.supplement [n.补品]
> 1)A health supplement is yeah a vitamin often they come in a big container and you eat one a day. 

> 2)Um yeah. Supplement could also mean like you're giving extra of something.Exactly yeah. If students don't have enough study at school, they can take a supplementary class.

# 8.immediate family[n.直系亲属] & extended family [n.大家庭] & sibling [n.兄弟姐妹] & close-knit [adj.关系密切的，十分亲近的] 
> 1）Exactly, yeah. If you think of the word immediate it's like now, right here.

> 2)Right yeah. So that just means yeah cousins grandfather is going up and up and long you know farther away from your mother, you know father and sister and brother.Right here exactly. And yeah the extended family can extend on and on and on and on and on and on and on until infinity /ɪn'fɪnəti/ [n.无限].

> 3)This of course is your immediate family your brothers and your sisters.

> 4)Yeah so close knit this just means you're close, you're connected, usually you're just like you're really close to each other.Right. It doesn't matter how big or small family is, right, how many family members, it could be you know a-four-person family.Yeah. That's a good point yeah and we often say this word community with it, close knit community.

# 9.gather together [phr.济济一堂] & get together & gathering 
> 1)Yeah it does. I mean it just means get together.And of course, you guys do. When you go home you do gather together with your family members. But then of course on and I haven't quite got all this straight after many many years but you know on day three you visit this family member and on day four probably don't visit any family member, next day you go to this person's house. So basically, you need to make a point to go visit other relatives throughout the holiday.

> 2)Sometimes you might say like if you have a small casual party with friends, you might call it a gathering.It's also called a get-together.

# 10.make a point to do/of doing sth [phr.强调、特地]
> It just means doing something intentionally.For sure right. So you said that there are two ways to say this, you could say make a point to go.You could also say make a point of going.Of going, you could even say make it a point to do something.

# 11.throughout [prep.贯穿]
> Alright, the next word we see is throughout, which just basically means from the beginning to the end.The whole time. You know it doesn't mean like constantly.Like, like you can't sleep you must go from relative to relative to relative, but it just means pretty pretty often.

# 12.empty-handed [adj.两手空空的]
> 1)Okay. This sounds pretty universal pretty cross-cultural. It really isn't polite to show up, you know, for a Christmas party or Christmas dinner with nothing in your hands.Exactly, yeah. Your hand is empty. So this just means without taking or bringing something.

> 2)But you might see this in a movie if there are some like thieves stealing something and they couldn't find something.They came back empty-handed.

# 13.old folks [phr.家中的长辈、父母] & old folks home [敬老院] &  retirement /rɪ'taɪɚmənt/ home & the little one & the kiddies & the ankle biters /'baɪtɚ/ & the little munchkins /'mʌntʃɪz/ 
> 1）Folks Yeah. It's just a nice nice way to call old people.Yeah yeah. It's a little casual but also polite. It's like a nice way to say you know people.

> 2)Well, I mean I use the word folks a lot when I'm talking like to some maybe some old people in my building, and it's like "Oh, Hi folks."Yeah yeah. Strangely, it also means parents.Yeah my folks. If you say "my folks are coming to town", my parents.

# 14.related & connection
> Right now this just means I can understand.So if I can relate to you it's like I have some kind of an idea connection almost.

# 15.all the bases covered [phr.所有方面都照顾到、周全]
> 1）All the bases covered. OK, another baseball expression here.Yeah. If you have all the bases covered in baseball, you're gonna win.

> 2)You're very prepared for the next step or the next play, right? So when you have all the bases covered, it generally just means you are very well prepared.Uh huh, yeah. You're doing everything that you need to be successful.

# V.pattern
***Laura, you have had so many deliveries lately.***

***That's right, Mason. I'm going home for Chinese New Year this week, and I'm still doing some last-minute shopping for everyone.***

***Don't you give red envelopes instead of gifts on Chinese New Year?***

***Yes, but those are usually for the kids. I wouldn't give my adult relatives cash or even coupons for that matter.***

***Yeah, I guess that would be a bit awkward. So what do you get them then?***

***For my older relatives, I usually buy things like health supplements.***

***So you buy gifts for your extended family then, not just your immediate family members?***

***Both. I come from a very close-knit family. My parents are very close to their siblings. So am I to my cousins.***

***Do you all gather together for the New Year?***

***We sure do! And we also make a point of going to visit other relatives throughout the holiday. And when you go visit, it's not polite to go empty-handed.***

***But buying gifts for everyone does add a bit of pressure. Money aside, I'm just running out of ideas.***

***I can certainly relate. I go through the same thing every Christmas.***

***But I'm pretty happy with my selection so far. I've got supplements and tea for the old folks; cookies, candies, toys and books for the little ones; skincare products for the ladies.***

***Sounds like you've got all the bases covered.***
