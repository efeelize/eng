# II.spring festival taboos
> With Spring Festival just around the corner, it's time to start planning all those fun activities. I'm sure that a lot of you have some family traditions, but you might also have a few Spring Festival taboos /tə'bu:z/. What are these? Well, they're things you're not supposed to do around this time of year!

# 1.cleaning or sweeping 
> First on our list is to avoid housework. Before the Spring Festival, there's a day of cleaning. This is to sweep away the bad luck. But during the actual celebration, it becomes taboo. Cleaning or throwing away garbage may wash away your wealth for the coming year.If you must sweep, start from the outside and sweep everything into the middle of the room. This symbolizes collecting wealth.

# 2.eating porridge
> Number two has to do with our first meal of the new year. Some people believe that eating porridge for breakfast will bring bad fortune. I myself love a bowl of porridge in the morning, no matter the occasion, so I don't follow this belief. But if you want to stick with tradition, cook up some dumplings instead.

# 3.breaking dishes
> Next up, it's believed that breaking things will break your connection with prosperity and fortune. If you happen to break something, wrap /ræp/ it in red paper while repeating auspicious /ɔ'spɪʃəs/ [adj.吉祥的] words or phrases. After the new year, throw the wrapped objects into a lake or river. This will reverse /rɪ'vɝs/ [v.反转]your misfortune.

# 4.giving the wrong gifts
> OK, last but not least, there's gift giving. Many people bring gifts when they pay a visit to family and friends. However, bringing the wrong gift can bring bad luck to both you and the recipient. With the red envelopes[n.红包], make sure you don't give an odd amount of lucky money. It's best to give even amounts, unless it contains the number four.Also,borrowing or lending money at this time is taboo.

> Well, there you have it. These rules may seem excessive /ɪkˈsɛsɪv/ [adj.过度的] during the Spring Festival. Especially when you add the other customs that come with this holiday. But like most things, it's better to be safe than sorry.
