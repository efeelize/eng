- While playing in the garden, Cathy broke her arm.

> 2)you can’’t shorten the ‘while' (dependent) clause because the subjects (the people in the house (they) and the person who broke into the house) are different.[这里就不能缩写while从句，因为从句和主句主语是不一样的，一个是主人，一个是闯进屋子的人。]

- While the owners were having a nap, somebody broke into the house.
