# brand_P&G
# I.How P&G became the maker of everything you buy for your house
> Even though they dominate your life now, P&G took a long time to become the wonder brand they are today. Here's how the little soap and candle shop transformed itself into a global giant.

> These days, Procter & Gamble owns 83 brands, 23 of which raked in over $1 billion last year.

# II.grammar
# 1.but for + noun phrase, subject + wouldn't have.
> we see the pattern "but for + noun phrase, subject + wouldn't have." The "but for" part of this construction is a past conditional and means "without," "if we didn't have," or "if it wasn't for." It's used
for talking about hypothetical situations, especially when something caused a beneficial or desirable result.

> A noun or noun phrase must follow the phrase "but for," but a verb or action can be expressed by using "but for the fact that + subject + verb phrase."The construction can be inverted, in which case a comma is not necessary.

***Hey, which laundry detergent is better: Tide, Downy or Gain?***

***They're the same, all owned by Procter & Gamble.***

***Wow, every personal or home care product under the sun is theirs.***

***Well, they've been around since 1837, selling just soap and candles then. You know but for them, we wouldn't have the term "soap operas."***

***Yeah, because they sponsored early radio dramas. Didn't they pioneer sponsorship as a marketing strategy?***

***Yep. Then they branched out with brands like Crest, Folgers,Pringles, and Pampers. They were head and shoulders above the rest!***

***Haha, they really knew how to widen their scope! It's amazing their products didn't cannibalize each other.***

***Yeah, but it hasn't all been smooth sailing. They've had plenty of scrutiny and disputes, like with animal testing and environmental sustainability.***

***Didn't they recently go through a big restructuring?***

***Yeah, they divested over 100 nonessential brands.***

***Interesting. At least they've made some gains during the pandemic.***
