# I.Streaming TV Providers in the U.S.[在线视频供应商]
> The rise of Netflix has affected the way audiences watch televised content. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey [Nielsen调查], more than 60% of Americans said they binge-watch shows [刷剧] and nearly eight out of 10 [五分之四] Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule. This model has been instrumental /ˌɪnstrə'mɛntl/ [有帮助的] in bringing in millions of new users across the globe, as this chart from Business Insider shows:

> With the success of Netflix, other streaming service [流媒体] have been trying to catch up[发展], like Amazon Prime, HBO Now, and Hulu. The main contender [竞争对手] in this race is surely Amazon Prime, as they are already a massively funded [资金雄厚] corporation invested in technology. 

# II.brand story
> “I got the idea for Netflix after I had a huge late fee for my Blockbuster DVD rental.” said Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix in 1998.It took on brick-and-mortar DVD rental stores by mailing DVDs directly to customers, charging a flat monthly rate and without late fees.

> But then Netflix made the move to capitalize on increasing internet speeds by introducing its current streaming model separate from DVD rentals.By paying a monthly subscription fee of $10.99, viewers could binge watch their favorite shows on demand.

> Netflix also began investing heavily in original content, debuting with the global smash hit House of Cards. Many more critically-acclaimed shows followed close at its heels. Other streaming services followed Netflix’s lead with high quality content, which ballooned into the industry we see today. But no rival has revolutionized the industry to the same degree that Netflix has. Nor has anyone come close to the 100 million global subscribers that Netflix boasts.
