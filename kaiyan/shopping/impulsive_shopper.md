# I.why do we struggle with impulse buying
# 1.we impulse buy because of emotions
> Emotions play a huge part in what we buy. When something's going on with us personally, it shows up in our money habits too. When you're having a rough day, does a little retail therapy sound like the cure? Making decisions based on pure emotion is a surefire way to let impulse buying take control.

# 2.we impulse buy because of our past
> the way parents handled money and the state of household when growing up were the top two reasons people handle money the way they do.Thinking about how money was handled in the household you grew up in will help you understand the foundation for your beliefs about money.

# 3.we impulse buy when there's a sale
> No one wants to pay full price for buying something.More than half of shoppers impulse buy because of a sale.However,this is a total marketing tactic.When you think you're getting a deal or "free shipping," you're way more likely to pull the trigger on the purchase,and that's exactly what they want you to do.

# II.grammar
# 1.monkey see,monkey do [phr.有样学样]
> It is an idiom we use to describe people who imitate or follow along with others without thinking about their actions, especially when doing inappropriate things. It is often used to talk about children who copy an older sibling or friend. Be careful, though, because it can be rude.

> You might be wondering why this idiom uses non-standard grammar. Why isn't it "Monkey sees, monkey does"? Or better yet, "What a monkey sees, it does"? Although the true origin of this phrase is unknown, its non-standard grammar is likely due to the fact that the phrase was taken from another language and directly translated to English. There are other examples of this in the English language with common phrases like "no can do," "long time no see" and "no pain, no gain."
