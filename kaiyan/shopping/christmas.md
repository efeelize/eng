# I.Christmas Eve
> Christmas Eve, also known as the Vigil /'vɪdʒɪl/ of Christmas [圣诞节守夜], is perceived /pɚ'siv/ [vt.察觉] as the culmination /'kʌlmə'neʃən/ [n.顶点] of the Advent season [降临节]. Christmas Eve is the day before Christmas Day and is associated with celebrating Jesus Christ's birth, although his actual birth date has been disputed among many scholars.[许多学者都质疑]

> However, many Christmas traditions that are around today have their roots [源于] in pre-Christian [基督教前] winter festivals [冬季节日]. These include the importance of candles and decorations made from evergreen bushes and trees [常青灌木和常青树], symbolizing everlasting /ˌɛvɚ'læstɪŋ/ [永恒] light and life.

> In Roman times, a mid-winter festival [中冬节] was held. This was a relaxing time with a lot of parties [聚会不停] and merry-making [欢乐不断]. It was also common to give other people small gifts, such as dolls for children and candles for adults. This festival culminated /'kʌlmɪnet/ with the celebration of the winter solstice /'sɑlstəs/ [n.冬至], which fell on December 25 in the Roman calendar [罗马历法].

> Christmas Eve is a public holiday [法定假日] in countries such as the Czech Republic [n.捷克共和国] and Estonia /ɛˈstoniə/ [n.爱沙尼亚]. Some banks and businesses are closed in some countries, including Austria and Germany, on Christmas Eve.

> In some countries, Christmas Eve is celebrated with large family meals featuring traditional Christmas dishes [圣诞节美味佳肴]. Many homes have their Christmas trees lit up [点亮], mistletoes /'mɪslto/ [n.槲(hu)寄生] hung, and other Christmas decorations, such as holly /'hɑli/ [冬青] and ivy /'aɪvi/ [常春藤], at this time of the year.

> 1)An appended clause [附加成分] is extra information we add to a sentence.We can use an appended clause with "being" when the verb in the clause and the verb in the main sentence have the same subject.[从句中的动词主语和主句中的动词主语相同]

- Being a student, he gets a discount

> 2)We use appended clauses with "being" to shorten what we are saying.Without an appended clause [当从句中的动词主语和主句中的动词主语相同时], we'd have to add "Since he" to our example:

- Being a student, he gets a discount.

> 3)We use appended clauses with "being" to shorten what we are saying.[附加成分来缩短我们说的话].Without an appended clause [不使用附加成分], we'd have to add "Since he" to our example:

- Since he is a student, he gets a discount.

- 1. Being the first to leave work, I avoid all the traffic.

- 2. Being a new employee, she needs to ask a lot of people for help.
