# I.Storm in a teacup: British and Chinese tea cultures
> As tea was first introduced to Britain by the royal family, British tea culture is marked with a sense of formality and grace, and traces of this can still be found in modern tearooms[即便在现代茶室中，仍然可以寻找到这种文化痕迹]. In the past, people dressed up [郑重打扮起来]and attended tea parties where socializing was the main activity, with concerts, garden walks [花园散步] and gambling as entertainment.

> As tea and sweet treats[n.甜点] go hand in hand, the English ritual /'rɪtʃuəl/ [n.礼仪]emphasizes conversation and presentation in a leisurely /'liʒɚli/ [adj.从容的] atmosphere. People take their time and enjoy a chat with their friends, often in the lobbies of grand hotels[高档酒店的大堂里] or in tearooms.

> Unlike the emphasis on presentation in British tea culture, Chinese tea culture emphasizes the virtues that come from within[内在美德], and a unity between human beings and nature[人与自然的合一感]. Chinese people also cherish the character of tea :fragrant but not aggressive[有芳香却不张扬],low-key but long lasting[低调而含韵悠长].
