# I.The best cities to visit in 2020 
# 1.Bonn /bɑn/ [n.波恩], Germany
> Once capital of West Germany, Bonn slipped off [phr.溜走；滑落] the radar [淡出了众人视线] when Berlin reseized the reins [重新掌权] in 1990. But it's back in the spotlight /'spɑtlaɪt/ [n.公众注意的中心] in 2020, as the city gears up [phr.准备好] to mark Beethoven /'bei,təuvən/ [贝多芬]'s 250th birthday. Well, you can expect a year-round [全年无休] line-up [v.排成行] of concerts drawing world-famous orchestras /'ɔrkɪstrə/ [n.管弦乐队], soloists /'soloɪst/ [n.独唱者；独奏者] and conductors /kən'dʌktɚ/ [n.(乐队)指挥]. 

# 2.La Paz /lə ˈpɑz/ [拉巴斯], Bolivia /bəˈlɪviə/
> Perhaps it's the Jetsonian [杰森式吊舱] gliding /'ɡlaɪdɪŋ/ [adj.流畅的] over La Paz along the world's largest cable-car system [缆车系统] that are the most obvious signs of its new-found ambition [重拾野心]. There were just three lines in 2014, but there will be 11 in 2020. Down below[缆车下], the once-drab /dræb/ [单调乏味的] city is racing towards a more radiant and inspired future [正迈向更加灿烂明媚的未来]. Everyone from a flamboyant /flæm'bɔɪənt/ [adj.(人或物)显眼的,浮夸的,炫耀的] self-taught architect to the budding /'bʌdɪŋ/ [adj.初露头角的] chefs leaving new culinary /'kʌlɪnɛri/ [adj.烹饪的] schools is thriving here.

# 3.Dubai, UAE [abbr.阿拉伯联合酋长国（United Arab Emirates）]
> The future is now in Dubai as the superlative-craving emirate /'ɛmərət/ [n.酋长国] launches several boundary-pushing marquee /mɑr'ki/ projects [开拓创新的大项目] in 2020. Top billing, of course, goes to the six-month-long World Expo 2020[为期6个月的2020年世博会], where 190 nations go all out in showcasing /'ʃokes/ [n.(商店或博物馆的)玻璃陈列柜] the latest visions in sustainability [可持续发展] and mobility [机动性] (think: flying cars) in architecturally /ˌɑrkə'tɛktʃərəli/ [adv.建筑上] showstopping [adj.〈褒〉因特别精彩而被观众的掌声打断的] pavilions /pə'vɪlɪən/ [展示馆]. Also expected to open is the Museum of the Future, a cabinet /'kæbɪnət/ [展览艺术品的小陈列室] of next-gen wonders in an eye-shaped building festooned /fɛ'stʊn/ [n.花彩(装饰)] with calligraphy /kə'lɪɡrəfi/ [n.书法]. [迪拜预计还将开放未来博物馆，这座镌刻着阿拉伯书法的建筑形如一只眼睛，聚焦新世代的种种奇迹]

# II.grammar
# 1.If I were you...I would...
> 1)the subjunctive /səb'dʒʌŋktɪv/ [n.虚拟语气] is used to express wishes and situations that aren't real, but in this lesson, the use of the "If I were you…" is intended to give advice.

> 2)The subject can be changed to "if he/she were you," but for giving advice, the subject is most commonly the speaker (first person "I").The second clause of sentence uses "would" like a regular subjunctive[普通虚拟语气]. Just remember, "were" never changes regardless of the subject[n.主语].

> 3)It's called the subjunctive mood, and we use it to talk about wishes, even regrets.And you might notice here, Monica says the word "were," not "was." She does not say, "if I was you." And that's what the subjunctive is. We always use "were." It doesn't matter.And you notice "if I were rich, I'd (I would)..." We always use "were," and "would" in the second part of the sentence when we use the subjunctive mood.

- 1. If I were you, I'd apologize.

- 2. A: I can't decide where to travel to, New York or L.A. B: I'd go to New York if I were you.

- 3. If she were here, she'd tell you not to do that.

# 2.debating [ptcp.考虑]
> 1)You may have seen this word debate before, like when two professors or scientists argue with each other about what is true.

> 2)This is like a debate in your head with yourself, like a debate alone.We even debate with ourselves when we choose what to eat for dinner.or like in the morning, I always debate should I sleep five more minutes or get out of bed.That's a really difficult debate sometimes. So we do use this word "debate" a lot. 

> 3)We even use this when we're like choosing something on a menu. Like, what are you gonna get, Johnny?I don’t know,I’m still debating.

# 3.architecture [n.建筑] & architect [n.建筑师]
> 1)Architecture is the design of buildings or bridges or other kinds of structures.

> 2)an architect is a person who designs like buildings, or like you said, bridges or any big structure.

# 4.Middle East [n.中东] & sweltering /'swɛltərɪŋ/  [adj.闷热的]
> 1)Dubai is in the Middle East and the Middle East is the area, the region that has countries like Egypt /ˈidʒɪpt/ , Saudi Arabia  /ˈsaʊdi əˈrebiə/ [n.沙特阿拉伯], Iran, Iraq. That's the Middle East.Right, or the United Arab Emirates /ə'miərət/ [UAE.阿联酋] .

> 2) sweltering means very, very, very hot. That's really all it means. it's that type of weather where you walk outside, and you're just like sweating right away, and you have to take like three showers a day. I mean a lot of it is desert, so it's no surprise and deserts are known for being sweltering hot.

> 3) just a note here, we usually say "it was sweltering," like the weather. We don't usually say "swelter" or "sweltered." Just "it is sweltering."

# 5.picturesque /ˌpɪktʃə'rɛsk/  [adj.风景如画的]
> 1)It's when something is so pretty or looks so nice that it could be in like a photo calendar or on a postcard or something.what comes to mind is like a beautiful mountain or like a nice lake.or a very picturesque sunset.

> 2) with this word "picturesque," we don't really use it to describe people. We mainly use it to talk about the scenery or the landscape.

# 6.exotic [adj.异域风情，与众不同的]
> exotic just means unusual or exciting because it comes from a different place. like a faraway country is very exotic. There's all kinds of ways to say this word. You can have exotic food. In this case, he's talking about an exotic culture.and it's something we don't see a lot.

# 7.green spaces [n.城市中的绿色空间]
> so green spaces are like parks, forests, just places where you can be in nature."In the city," that's the important part because if you go to the mountains, it's all green, but the green spaces are these places in the city.like for example, we have this big park with a big forest in it in Vancouver /vænˈkuvɚ/ [温哥华] called Stanley Park, and this is a huge green space.
