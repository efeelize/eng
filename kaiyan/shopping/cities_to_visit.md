# 1.Bonn /bɑn/ [n.波恩], Germany
> Once capital of West Germany, Bonn slipped off [phr.溜走；滑落] the radar [淡出了众人视线] when Berlin reseized the reins [重新掌权] in 1990. But it's back in the spotlight /'spɑtlaɪt/ [n.公众注意的中心] in 2020, as the city gears up [phr.准备好] to mark Beethoven /'bei,təuvən/ [贝多芬]'s 250th birthday.

# 2.La Paz /lə ˈpɑz/ [拉巴斯], Bolivia /bəˈlɪviə/
> Perhaps it's the Jetsonian [杰森式吊舱] gliding /'ɡlaɪdɪŋ/ [adj.流畅的] over La Paz along the world's largest cable-car system [缆车系统] that are the most obvious signs of its new-found ambition [重拾野心]. There were just three lines in 2014, but there will be 11 in 2020. Down below[缆车下], the once-drab /dræb/ [单调乏味的] city is racing towards a more radiant and inspired future [正迈向更加灿烂明媚的未来]. Everyone from a flamboyant /flæm'bɔɪənt/ [adj.(人或物)显眼的,浮夸的,炫耀的] self-taught architect to the budding /'bʌdɪŋ/ [adj.初露头角的] chefs leaving new culinary /'kʌlɪnɛri/ [adj.烹饪的] schools is thriving here.

# 3.Dubai, UAE [abbr.阿拉伯联合酋长国（United Arab Emirates）]
> The future is now in Dubai as the superlative-craving emirate /'ɛmərət/ [n.酋长国] launches several boundary-pushing marquee /mɑr'ki/ projects [开拓创新的大项目] in 2020. Top billing, of course, goes to the six-month-long World Expo 2020[为期6个月的2020年世博会], where 190 nations go all out in showcasing /'ʃokes/ [n.(商店或博物馆的)玻璃陈列柜] the latest visions in sustainability [可持续发展] and mobility [机动性] (think: flying cars) in architecturally /ˌɑrkə'tɛktʃərəli/ [adv.建筑上] showstopping [adj.〈褒〉因特别精彩而被观众的掌声打断的] pavilions /pə'vɪlɪən/ [展示馆].

[迪拜预计还将开放未来博物馆，这座镌刻着阿拉伯书法的建筑形如一只眼睛，聚焦新世代的种种奇迹]

# II.Los Angeles: The Movie Capital of America
> For over a century, LA has been the center of the movie universe. Hollywood not only has great power in American culture, but also in cultures around the world. Of course the question many people ask is "why Hollywood?" Why not New York, for example: another great cultural city in America. There are actually two pretty good reasons. One, a hundred years ago, the technology used to make movies was owned and controlled by the inventor Thomas Edison. As a result, he refused to allow people to use his technology to make movies that he couldn't control. However, Edison lived in New Jersey, on the east coast of America. California, remember, is on the west coast, far away from Mr. Edison's control. That might be the reason filmmakers went to California, but the reason they remained is because of the weather. Unlike New York, where winter would make it difficult to shoot movies, In California, you can shoot movies all throughout the year.

# III.Top 6 places to check out in London

Other highlights [亮点] include the famous Crown Jewels exhibition [王冠珠宝展], the Beefeaters [伦敦塔卫兵], and the Royal Mint [英国皇家造币厂].

# 2.Illinois /ˌɪləˈnɔɪ/
> "Illinois" is the modern spelling [更为现代的拼法] of the early French explorers' [早期法国探险家] name for the people they found living in the area. According to the writings of Jacques Marquette, a French missionary /'mɪʃənɛri/ [传教士] and explorer, when the villagers [土著] there were asked who they were, they replied that they were "Illinois", meaning "the men" in their language.

# 3.Montana /mɔn'tænə/

# IV.Spencer's D.C. recommendations (P.S. They're all free!)
> if there are you know other things that you're interested in in regard to D.C.. There's actually you know quite a bit to do, there's a lot of awesome restaurants, it's a really international city because of all the different you know diplomats and stuff from around the world, different government organizations there.

> And night life really isn't too bad either, so if you guys are young and you like to go out at night you know may be drinking a bit feel free to check out neighborhoods such as Dupont circle, or you can go to U Street. That's where Ben's Chili Bowl is, also another famous neighborhood for its night life is called Adams Morgan.I know right there's a popular bar in Adams Morgan called Madams Organ.

> so really is a lot to do and I said as I was saying earlier my favorite thing to do is to walk around the Potomac river and there's a trail there called the Billy goat trail.It's awesome, filled with rocks you got to like climb and it's really outdoorsy and you just your just in the middle of nature and it's gorgeous.sweat it up a little bit. We actually had a cliff there's like a, at least I don't know it's about forty depending on how high the water is, a forty to fifty foot cliff that we would jump off of into the river.

> Anyway,D.C. is a city that has a lot of nature to offer too, so I think it's a nice balance.

# 1.National Zoo [国家动物园]
> If you're travelling with the kids, The National Zoo needs to be on your list of places to visit. Located in Rock Creek National Park, it is home to over 400 species of animals. Many people don't know that this is also a Smithsonian institution, which might explain the ticket price [完全免费]!

# 2.The Smithsonian Museums [史密森博物馆体系]
> You've probably figured out by now that Smithsonian means "free". The Smithsonian Institution was established in 1846 with the estate /ɪ'stet/ [遗赠捐款] of British scientist James Smithson. It's a group of museums and research centers administered by the Government of the United States. [由美国政府资助、半官方性质的第三部门博物馆机构]

# 3.The Kennedy Center [肯尼迪中心]

> What? You can visit the Pentagon? The headquarters of the American Department of Defense [美国国防部]? It's true, although for this tour you will need to book in advance.[提前预订]

# V.grammar
# 1.If I were you...I would...
> 1)the subjunctive /səb'dʒʌŋktɪv/ [n.虚拟语气] is used to express wishes and situations that aren't real, but in this lesson, the use of the "If I were you…" is intended to give advice.

> 2)The subject can be changed to "if he/she were you," but for giving advice, the subject is most commonly the speaker (first person "I").The second clause of sentence uses "would" like a regular subjunctive[普通虚拟语气]. Just remember, "were" never changes regardless of the subject[n.主语].

> 3)It's called the subjunctive mood, and we use it to talk about wishes, even regrets.And you might notice here, Monica says the word "were," not "was." She does not say, "if I was you." And that's what the subjunctive is. We always use "were." It doesn't matter.And you notice "if I were rich, I'd (I would)..." We always use "were," and "would" in the second part of the sentence when we use the subjunctive mood.

- 1. If I were you, I'd apologize.

- 2. A: I can't decide where to travel to, New York or L.A. B: I'd go to New York if I were you.

- 3. If she were here, she'd tell you not to do that.

# 2.debating [ptcp.考虑] & imagined & thought & where do I start [phr.太多了，从何开始]
> 1)You may have seen this word debate before, like when two professors or scientists argue with each other about what is true.

> 2)This is like a debate in your head with yourself, like a debate alone.We even debate with ourselves when we choose what to eat for dinner.or like in the morning, I always debate should I sleep five more minutes or get out of bed.That's a really difficult debate sometimes. So we do use this word "debate" a lot. 

> 3)We even use this when we're like choosing something on a menu. Like, what are you gonna get, Johnny?I don’t know,I’m still debating.

> 4)so "imagined" is basically thought.what I thought, what I assumed. But part of the reason we use "imagined" instead of "thought" here or "assumed" is because at least in my mind this kind of gives you more of a picture.And it's also a little bit more creative.We always think, right? Because we always want to say like, you know,hey, could you imagine if we won the lottery?And you start to think very creatively.Or someone who is very creative when they are thinking about things that haven't happened, we could say they have a very wild imagination.

> 5) if someone asks for your opinion, "What do you think about Donald Trump?"It's a good way to say I have many opinions about that.

# 3.architecture [n.建筑] & architect [n.建筑师]
> 1)Architecture is the design of buildings or bridges or other kinds of structures.

> 2)an architect is a person who designs like buildings, or like you said, bridges or any big structure.

# 4.Middle East [n.中东] & sweltering /'swɛltərɪŋ/  [adj.闷热的]
> 1)Dubai is in the Middle East and the Middle East is the area, the region that has countries like Egypt /ˈidʒɪpt/ , Saudi Arabia  /ˈsaʊdi əˈrebiə/ [n.沙特阿拉伯], Iran, Iraq. That's the Middle East.Right, or the United Arab Emirates /ə'miərət/ [UAE.阿联酋] .

> 2) sweltering means very, very, very hot. That's really all it means. it's that type of weather where you walk outside, and you're just like sweating right away, and you have to take like three showers a day. I mean a lot of it is desert, so it's no surprise and deserts are known for being sweltering hot.

> 3) just a note here, we usually say "it was sweltering," like the weather. We don't usually say "swelter" or "sweltered." Just "it is sweltering."

# 5.n+y -> adj. & glitzy /'glɪtsɪ/ [adj.闪耀的、耀眼的] & glitz & touristy [adj.适宜旅游的] & tourist
> There are a few different ways to make adjectives from English nouns. One of the ways we talked about in today's lesson is to add a "y" to the end of a noun. You see this a lot in words like "rainy," "windy," "sunny," but these adjectives don't just need to talk about weather.

> What's interesting about these adjectives is that a lot of them have pretty negative connotations. In today's lesson, we talked about "glitzy" and "touristy," So "glitzy" is basically "glamorous" but not in the super classy way it's more in the flashy way.Yeah exactly, even a little bit showy.Not in a good way.two words that themselves come from the nouns "glitz" and "tourist." Neither of these words is exactly positive. Another example would be that if something has too much sugar in it, you can say that it's "sugary." Here, the difference between "sugary" and "sweet" is that sweet is completely neutral, whereas "sugary" definitely carries the meaning of "too much sugar."

> It doesn't mean that all adjectives ending with -y are negative (who thinks "sunny" is bad?). However, a great deal of them, especially new ones, are.

- 1. I don't know why, but I love listening to cheesy love songs. [肉麻的情歌]

- 2. Don't bother ordering soup. All of their soups are so watery. [太淡了]

- 3. If your food tastes too salty, you should try adding some lemon juice.

- 4. For some strange reason, she says it's easier for her to concentrate in noisy places.[吵闹的] 

- 5. We have such nosy /'nozi/ [爱管闲事] neighbors. They should really mind their own business.

# 6.exotic [adj.异域风情，与众不同的] &  larger than life [phr,传奇的、不同凡响的] & family-friendly  & picturesque /ˌpɪktʃə'rɛsk/  [adj.风景如画的] & impressive [adj.很强、印象深刻] & spectacular /spɛk'tækjəlɚ/ [adj.壮观的] & spectacle /'spɛktəkl/ [n.壮观的景象] & historical /hɪ'stɔrɪkl/
> 1)exotic just means unusual or exciting because it comes from a different place. like a faraway country is very exotic. There's all kinds of ways to say this word. You can have exotic food. In this case, he's talking about an exotic culture.and it's something we don't see a lot.

> 2)"Larger than life" is just something that's really extraordinary, special. So here we're talking about a city. 

> 3)But usually when I used this phrase, I use it for people.Like you just mentioned, celebrities.A celebrity is larger than life. May be the leader, you know, a country's leader is larger than life.They're just really special and different.However it seems that in reality,it was very chill and family-friendly.

> 4)Family-friendly. so good for the family, fun for everyone.But most of the time when we say something is family-friendly it usually means it's probably fun for the kids.For the kids,like a family-friendly restaurant would be really loud.

> 5)"picturesque,"It's when something is so pretty or looks so nice that it could be in like a photo calendar or on a postcard or something.what comes to mind is like a beautiful mountain or like a nice lake.or a very picturesque sunset.

> 6) "picturesque," we don't really use it to describe people. We mainly use it to talk about the scenery or the landscape.

> 7)impressive：it's just super awesome.so I'm not thinking so much beautiful, but definitely convenient and well constructed. The subway system in Shanghai, super impressive.

> 8)Now people can also impress other people.For example if you are a very good candidate for a job you might impress the panel of interviewers.And they might even say that candidate was impressive, or that you know, they were all impressive candidates, but we need to choose one.

> 9)So something spectacular, if you want to say something is amazing, that's fine. If you want to say something is gorgeous, that's fine. But spectacular is OMG,it's amazing.

> 10)so anything you can see, it's like a great thing to see, it's a spectacle.So I went to a concert yesterday and it was amazing and spectacular!

> 11)So here we have historical, so you see the word history in historical, so basically it means to have history and like you said, a lot of times it has like important history.so a historical building has a lot of history and usually quite a bit of importance.

# 7.green spaces [n.城市中的绿色空间] & nosebleed /'nozblid/ seats [phr.非常高的座位] & nosebleed section
> 1）so green spaces are like parks, forests, just places where you can be in nature."In the city," that's the important part because if you go to the mountains, it's all green, but the green spaces are these places in the city.like for example, we have this big park with a big forest in it in Vancouver /vænˈkuvɚ/ [温哥华] called Stanley Park, and this is a huge green space.

> 2)So the thing about this phrase is you could say "nosebleed seats", you could also say" nosebleed section".This is a great phrase I love this one. Imagine if you will, you are sitting in seats that are so high, so high off the ground, far away from, you know, the game.That your nose starts to bleed.So I've never been to like a professional sporting event, so I wouldn't know but I'm assuming it's because you're so high and the air is really cold up there.It's like being on a really high mountain. 

# 8.get around [phr.随意走走] & catch hop on-hop off bus / a double-decker bus [n.随上随下的观光巴士] & get the lay of the land [phr,了解当地情况] & pop into/stop by  [v.进来看看] & sightseeing [n.观光旅游]
> 1)so basically it's what mode of transportation did you use.so this basically means how did she move how did you move herself and her family so of course that question sounds kind of silly. It might be better to think you know how did she get from point A to point B.

> 2)Now I'm curious Adam how do you usually get around in Shanghai.

> 3)And you catch the bus, so this is the verb that we use for taking the bus or you catch the train, you catch the bus.And so like for example, oh my car didn't start this morning so I caught the bus.

> 4)now here the bus is a special bus, what we call a double-decker bus.it's 2 floors,it's a hop on and hop off.hop is like a small jump,cause in the past the buses didn't really stop, haha, you have to run and jump.

> 5)this is a great expression. It used to mean it, its oringinal meaning is the shape of the land. But now it's this expression, it means you're trying to get used to something you, you're getting adjusted to the arrangement of something.You're orienting yourself.Like often when you get a new job, you have to get the lay of the land first before you get more comfortable.and that doesn't necessarily mean where your office is, and where the washroom is.It means like the rules meet some of the people, kind of get used to something, get adjusted.

> 6)when you're on vacation, you want to do this, you want to get the lay of the land, where is everything? You know, what do I really want to see?You kind of get more familiar or oriented with something.More information so you can feel more comfortable.

> 7)pop to check out very casual.You can say things like pop by or stop by, but there's a lot of words like that.

> 8)Sightseeing, so this means visiting all the famous attractions of a particular area.like famous places,the monuments,the memorials,the other type of landmarks /'lændmɑrk/ [n.地标].

> 1)National mall：it's a large open park,it is often referred to as America's Front Lawn /lɔn/ [n.草坪;草地].So a mall is basically a big public area that is just like grass maybe some flowers and people like to go and hang out on the mall. In D.C. during the summer time, people love to hang out on the National Mall.So the National Mall in America is a really big rectangular /rɛk'tæŋgjəlɚ/ -shaped [n.直角形状] piece of land with grass and is surrounded by museums and stuff.

> 7)so this is home to the United States Congress while the White House is where the president lives.so the White House is not on Capitol Hill, but it's close by just so you guys know.Capitol here hasn't O instead of an A now, so I always see the O so a kind of I thought that's how you spell capital for a little bit when I realised that actually capital city is still spelled with an A whereas here is with an O. Anyway just remember guys in D.C. the capital, which is spelled with an A, we have a place called Capitol Hill which hasn't O, kind of silly. 

> 8)Potomac river is the river between Maryland and Virginia the two States.And D.C. too.

> 9)Ben's Chili /'tʃɪli/ [n.红辣椒] Bowl, this is actually a pretty historical restaurants in D.C.. It's not fancy, it's cheap. We call it in English you can call it a greasy spoon.And a lot of people like to go there after a night of drinking.It's very packed, very, a lot of people there late on a Saturday night.Chili is a food that has different spices.It's kind of stew.

# 12.parliament [n.议会] & congress /kən'ɡrɛs/ [n.国会] & Senate [n.参议院] & capitalism /'kæpɪtəlɪzəm/ [n.资本主义] & human capital [n.人力资本]
> 1）so every country has Parliament buildings, that's where the government the leaders they meet to talk about what they're going to do, you know, for the country.Any country that has a prime minister.like Canada, England, Australia, Singapore even, there's that British connection, so we have parliaments.

> 2)the US doesn't have a parliament.they have congress and senate.

> 3)capitalism :if you guys are in to Karl Marx he wrote a book called Capital and talks all about that, but yet capital is kind of like the money and resources that you have.

> 4)You can also describe capital in terms of what it is. For example in China there is a lot of human capital.a lot of people people work, a lot of human capital.

# 13.pub & pint [n.品脱，一大杯] & a collection of [phr.一系列]
> 1)a local pub or just a local bar, but in London, if you ever been to London, you know these pubs, they're like 400 years old.and they're also very different than what we know in the west of... The original meaning of pub is public house and it was for all of the people in the community. So actually if you go into a real pub in England, there will be like children even in the pub. I even went to one that had a swimming pool, yeah so they're very fun for everybody.And you go play darts /da:ts/ [v.扔飞镖]，or you can have a pint.

> 2)A pint, so this is beer.It's a glass, it's a large glass. This is, if you're interested in the exact size, it's 20 ounces. If you, if you know Starbucks, then maybe you know a venti size, that is the same.

> 3)So a collection it could mean that we are collecting museums and galleries.a collection of here means a bunch of stuff all together pretty much.if you're really rich you might have a collection of cars in which case you collect them.I might say, on this street there is a collection of bars.I heard there's a collection of Chinese restaurants in San Francisco.

# 14.states [n.州] & colonies /'kɑləni/ [n.殖民地] & lower 48 [n.下48州，除了阿拉斯加和夏威夷的其他48个州] & Rhode /rəud/ Island [n.罗德岛] & Washington,D.C. 
> 1)You guys probably know what a state is in Canada, we have provinces but they're just kind of like smaller communities I guess not quite a country.Basically, they all make up the country-- the part of the country. China has provinces. Canada has provinces. But America, we have states.

> 2)So a colony is kind of like the people of one country go to another country and they take the lead.So obviously this is a good word to know colony. A lot of people are not very happy that there were colonies in the past and some people, well like people in Canada which is also a former British colony, are kind of okay with it.so many many places around the world were colonized at one point in their former colonies, Africa, South America, and North America. 

> 3)lower forty-eight:so if you guys have ever looked at a map of the United States of America, you might be able to guess, why forty-eight is an important number especially when the total number of states is fifty.so earlier on, about sixty-plus years ago, America only had forty-eight states and then, the biggest state-- which is Alaska. Right. Alaska became the forty- nine and then Hawaii all the way out in the Pacific, became the fiftieth. So we now have this term called the lower forty-eight, because all of the states, the original forty-eight states are below Alaska, the lower on the map.it's pretty crazy and Russia must not be happy that they sold Alaska to America. Anyway, so just member guys, the lower forty-eight is just all the forty-eight states of America that are together on that map.

> 4)Rhode Island is the smallest.It is located in the northeastern United States.

> 5)D.C. stands for the District of Columbia, so we call Washington, D.C.. You also see later in the lesson that people just call it D.C., so Washington, D.C. is the capital of the United States.that's where you're going to find all the lawmakers, government people.One thing here to note is that Washington is also a state and Washington, D.C. is the city, so just try not to get those two confused.Washington state is in the northwest of America and Washington, D.C. we say is in the mid-Atlantic which is on the east coast.absolute favorite thing to do a cool thing about D.C. is that if you want to be downtown in the city you can be there if you want to be out in nature surrounded by trees rocks water you can be there in like fifteen minutes it's really nice.

# 15.you really know your stuff [phr.你真的很博学、在行]
> So really knowing your stuff basically means you are very very knowledgeable about everything.Basically, you are smart and you know a lot.

# 16.while...& when 
> "While" is a conjunction that is used to connect two action that happen at the same time. Very often, at least one of the phrases is in the continuous /kən'tɪnjʊəs/  or  /prə'ɡrɛsɪv/ tense [adj.在这进行] (I was running, she was eating, etc.). 

> It is often confused with “when”: even though a lot of times they can both be used in the same sentence, it is best to use “when” when you are talking about a specific time (when I was a student, when I was a child).

- 1. While you were at home wasting time, I was out making money!

- 2. Now since we've got smartphones, we can watch a video clip while reading.

- 3. A lot of things changed while you were away.

# 17.synonymous /sɪ'nɑnɪməs/ [adj.同义的,类义的] & synonym [n.同义词]
> 1)there're lots of other places that are synonymous with London.for something to be synonymous with something else, it means you always make the connection between those things.So Canada is synonymous with maple syrup /'sɪrəp/ [n.糖浆]. 

> 2)just a quick note, that word "synonymous" comes from "synonym", which means something that has the same meaning.

# 18.that would be 
> 1)When responding to a question, “that would be” is often used in place of saying “that is” or “it is”. In general, “that would be” sounds softer and more polite.

> 2)this is just like a very spoken way of responding to a question and it really just means is or was.And either way we would use this is if another student got this answer wrong.

- 1. A: Who knows which city is the capital of the United States? B: That would be Washington, D.C. 

- 2. A: Which country is the largest country in the world? B: Russia would be the largest country in the world.

- 3. A: Who is the guy in the yellow shirt? B: That would be Mark.
