# top 10 cities to visit
# I.The best cities to visit in 2020 
# 1.Bonn /bɑn/ [n.波恩], Germany
> Once capital of West Germany, Bonn slipped off [phr.溜走；滑落] the radar [淡出了众人视线] when Berlin reseized the reins [重新掌权] in 1990. But it's back in the spotlight /'spɑtlaɪt/ [n.公众注意的中心] in 2020, as the city gears up [phr.准备好] to mark Beethoven /'bei,təuvən/ [贝多芬]'s 250th birthday. Well, you can expect a year-round [全年无休] line-up [v.排成行] of concerts drawing world-famous orchestras /'ɔrkɪstrə/ [n.管弦乐队], soloists /'soloɪst/ [n.独唱者；独奏者] and conductors /kən'dʌktɚ/ [n.(乐队)指挥]. 

# 2.La Paz /lə ˈpɑz/ [拉巴斯], Bolivia /bəˈlɪviə/
> Perhaps it's the Jetsonian [杰森式吊舱] gliding /'ɡlaɪdɪŋ/ [adj.流畅的] over La Paz along the world's largest cable-car system [缆车系统] that are the most obvious signs of its new-found ambition [重拾野心]. There were just three lines in 2014, but there will be 11 in 2020. Down below[缆车下], the once-drab /dræb/ [单调乏味的] city is racing towards a more radiant and inspired future [正迈向更加灿烂明媚的未来]. Everyone from a flamboyant /flæm'bɔɪənt/ [adj.(人或物)显眼的,浮夸的,炫耀的] self-taught architect to the budding /'bʌdɪŋ/ [adj.初露头角的] chefs leaving new culinary /'kʌlɪnɛri/ [adj.烹饪的] schools is thriving here.

# 3.Dubai, UAE [abbr.阿拉伯联合酋长国（United Arab Emirates）]
> The future is now in Dubai as the superlative-craving emirate /'ɛmərət/ [n.酋长国] launches several boundary-pushing marquee /mɑr'ki/ projects [开拓创新的大项目] in 2020. Top billing, of course, goes to the six-month-long World Expo 2020[为期6个月的2020年世博会], where 190 nations go all out in showcasing /'ʃokes/ [n.(商店或博物馆的)玻璃陈列柜] the latest visions in sustainability [可持续发展] and mobility [机动性] (think: flying cars) in architecturally /ˌɑrkə'tɛktʃərəli/ [adv.建筑上] showstopping [adj.〈褒〉因特别精彩而被观众的掌声打断的] pavilions /pə'vɪlɪən/ [展示馆]. Also expected to open is the Museum of the Future, a cabinet /'kæbɪnət/ [展览艺术品的小陈列室] of next-gen wonders in an eye-shaped building festooned /fɛ'stʊn/ [n.花彩(装饰)] with calligraphy /kə'lɪɡrəfi/ [n.书法]. [迪拜预计还将开放未来博物馆，这座镌刻着阿拉伯书法的建筑形如一只眼睛，聚焦新世代的种种奇迹]

# II.grammar
# 1.If I were you...I would...
> 1)the subjunctive /səb'dʒʌŋktɪv/ [n.虚拟语气] is used to express wishes and situations that aren't real, but in this lesson, the use of the "If I were you…" is intended to give advice.

> 2)The subject can be changed to "if he/she were you," but for giving advice, the subject is most commonly the speaker (first person "I").The second clause of sentence uses "would" like a regular subjunctive[普通虚拟语气]. Just remember, "were" never changes regardless of the subject[n.主语].

- 1. If I were you, I'd apologize.

- 2. A: I can't decide where to travel to, New York or L.A. B: I'd go to New York if I were you.

- 3. If she were here, she'd tell you not to do that.

***Hey Jeremy, are you traveling overseas for your vacation this summer?***

***Yeah, but I'm still debating where to go.***

***Oh, if I were you, I'd go to Dubai. It was in a Lonely Planet article about the top 10 cities to visit this year. The architecture is so impressive.***

***Hmm, but the Middle East will be sweltering in the summer.***

***Good point. How about Europe? The old German capital of Bonn sounds really picturesque.***

***Well I went to Europe last time, so I was hoping to see a different continent.***

***How about South America? La Paz, Bolivia, was on the list. It has a thriving community that's grown a lot.***

***That sounds pretty nice, actually. Latin American culture is so exotic and charming. Where are you going for vacation?***

***I think Vancouver, Canada. They have gorgeous mountains, beaches, and lots of green spaces.***

***Nice choice there, eh?***
