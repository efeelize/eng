# I.Types of handbags you need to know
> An outfit is not complete without the perfect handbag to match. This guide will help make your next handbag purchase an educated one:

# 1. The Messenger Bag[邮差包]
> The messenger bag finds its place in history because of its classic utilitarian /ˌjutɪlɪ'tɛrɪən/ [adj.有效用的;实用的] design. Women have taken a cue from their male counterparts and have begun to incorporate the messenger bag into their own ensembles /ɑn'sɑmbl/ [全套穿搭].The messenger bag has a thin structure with a flap over the top[顶部有翻盖] and a long strap /stræp/ [带子] meant to be worn crossbody[斜挎]. It is perfect for the on-the-go scholar[四处忙碌的学者] or executive to carry notebooks or a laptop.

# 2. The Satchel /'sætʃəl/ [n.剑桥包]
> The satchel purse can take the form of a mini messenger bag or it can have a classic ladylike look[经典淑女包] with a handle on either side of a top zipper enclosure[顶部拉链外层的两侧各有一个提手].

# 3.The tote bag.
> Also known as the “shopper’s bag”, the tote bag is very handy[用起来非常方便]. This bag is typically worn with both its short straps upon one shoulder[两个短带子背在一侧肩膀上], and has a simple structure with minimal to no pockets.A classic canvas /'kænvəs/ [帆布] tote is perfect for running your weekend errands /ˈɛrənd/ [差事], while a sleek /slik/ [亮皮的] leather tote is ideal for carrying around your documents from meeting to meeting.
