# brand_LVMH
# I.What do LV, Tiffany & Co and Sephora have in common?
> The answer is LVMH: a multinational holding company born from a merger between Louis Vuitton and the wine and spirits company Moët Hennessy.Since 1987, this luxury goliath has been gaining steam and now owns over 70 coveted brands.Its success is largely thanks to its CEO Bernard Arnault, nicknamed "the Wolf in Cashmere"

> Arnault, interestingly enough, had his start in engineering, but made his foray into fashion when he bought Christian Dior in 1984.Since then, his MO has been to aggressively acquire luxury brands while maintaining each brand's heritage and fostering an entrepreneurial spirit.

> Perhaps the greatest allure of LVMH brands is their ability to meld timelessness with modernity.Its younger houses like Rihanna's Fenty are also giving LVMH currency with younger consumers.Having already redefined luxury and history, what's next for LVMH?
