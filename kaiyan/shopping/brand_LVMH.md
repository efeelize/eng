***What do LV, Tiffany & Co and Sephora have in common?***

***The answer is LVMH: a multinational holding company born from a merger between Louis Vuitton and the wine and spirits company Moët Hennessy.***

***Since 1987, this luxury goliath has been gaining steam and now owns over 70 coveted brands.***

***Its success is largely thanks to its CEO Bernard Arnault, nicknamed "the Wolf in Cashmere"***

***Arnault, interestingly enough, had his start in engineering, but made his foray into fashion when he bought Christian Dior in 1984.***

***Since then, his MO has been to aggressively acquire luxury brands while maintaining each brand's heritage and fostering an entrepreneurial spirit.***

***Perhaps the greatest allure of LVMH brands is their ability to meld timelessness with modernity.***

***Its younger houses like Rihanna's Fenty are also giving LVMH currency with younger consumers.***

***Having already redefined luxury and history, what's next for LVMH?***
