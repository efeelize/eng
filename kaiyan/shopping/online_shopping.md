# I.Origin of Black Friday
> The first known use of the term "Black Friday" appeared in 1951, and referred to the practice of employees calling in sick the day[请病假] after Thanksgiving to get a four-day weekend[连着周末过4日小长假], since companies back then didn't offer Friday as a paid day off. Ten years later, Philadelphia police began to use both "Black Friday" and "Black Saturday" to describe the mayhem /'mehɛm/ [n.大混乱] that was caused by extra pedestrians /pə'dɛstrɪən/[n.步行者] and traffic jams when hordes /hɔ:d/ [一大群] of shoppers crowded downtown stores[人们蜂拥向商场购物而造成的交通拥堵的混乱场面] on the two days following Thanksgiving. Some believe that[有人认为] the term came about[起源] since retailers would finally begin making a profit after operating at a loss for the entire year[从这一天开始，零售商由亏转盈], going from "in the red" (in debt[账面上由红转黑]) to "in the black" (making profit). However, the earliest accounting-related usage /'jusɪdʒ/ [n. 使用] dates from 1981, years after Philadelphia police were using the term to describe the insanely congested /kən'dʒɛstɪd/ [拥挤的] traffic.

# II.The rise of the DTC business model
> Along with the rise of e-commerce has come the ascension of the perfect e-commerce business model: direct-to-consumer sales. Some of the biggest names in retail today were or are direct-to-consumer companies, including Warby Parker, Dollar Shave Club, Casper, Bonobos, and Glossier.

> The DTC (direct-to-consumer) business model offers numerous advantages to the retail entrepreneur.Before the internet, retail was run by distributors.[在互联网兴起之前，零售是由经销商负责的] If you could show that selling your product would be worth the time, energy and money of the distributor, you could get it on the shelves in Macy's[Macy's百货], Target, or Sephora. If you couldn't, good luck.

> Then came the internet. Retailers had always been able to sell to consumers directly before, but the internet made it much easier.Companies using the DTC model could cut out the middlemen inherent to traditional retail and wholesale models, and pass the savings onto the customers, with lower markups[摆脱传统零售和批发模式中固有的中间商的环节]. They could, as they discovered later, also present a tightly controlled brand experience from beginning to end and benefit in that.[零售商后来发现，他们可以以此创造出自始至终都可控的品牌消费体验，并从中获利]
