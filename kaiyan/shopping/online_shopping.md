# I.Origin of Black Friday
> The first known use of the term "Black Friday" appeared in 1951, and referred to the practice of employees calling in sick the day[请病假] after Thanksgiving to get a four-day weekend[连着周末过4日小长假], since companies back then didn't offer Friday as a paid day off. Ten years later, Philadelphia police began to use both "Black Friday" and "Black Saturday" to describe the mayhem /'mehɛm/ [n.大混乱] that was caused by extra pedestrians /pə'dɛstrɪən/[n.步行者] and traffic jams when hordes /hɔ:d/ [一大群] of shoppers crowded downtown stores[人们蜂拥向商场购物而造成的交通拥堵的混乱场面] on the two days following Thanksgiving. Some believe that[有人认为] the term came about[起源] since retailers would finally begin making a profit after operating at a loss for the entire year[从这一天开始，零售商由亏转盈], going from "in the red" (in debt[账面上由红转黑]) to "in the black" (making profit). However, the earliest accounting-related usage /'jusɪdʒ/ [n. 使用] dates from 1981, years after Philadelphia police were using the term to describe the insanely congested /kən'dʒɛstɪd/ [拥挤的] traffic.
