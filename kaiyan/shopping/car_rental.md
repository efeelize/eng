# I.All you need to know about renting a car in the US
# 1.Car rental companies
> The biggest national car rental companies include Alamo, Avis, Budget, Dollar, Hertz, National and Thrifty. National rental companies have offices in all major cities and at international airports that are open from around 8 am to 10 pm. They also provide national toll-free telephone numbers[面向全国提供可免费拨打的电话服务]. Of the major companies, Dollar and Thrifty are generally the cheapest, although all companies offer special rates[特惠折扣], e.g. corporate[企业折扣], 24-hour, weekend, weekly, off-peak[非高峰期] and holiday rates. Some may offer extended periods[延长出租期限] on certain categories of cars and bonus coupons for airline tickets[机票的优惠券] as well.

# 2.Requirements
> You must usually be 21 to rent a car and must have held a license for a minimum of a year[持有驾照一年]. A few companies, e.g. Avis, rent to 18-year-olds in most cities, although Hertz have a minimum age requirement of 25. Many rental companies levy [征收附加费] a "young driver" surcharge per day on all drivers under 25, although women under 25 may be charged a lower premium than men, as they’re less accident prone[不太容易发生事故].

> If you have a foreign license without a photograph, you may be asked to show your passport. You should also have an International Driver’s Permit (IDP), which must be used in conjunction with your foreign license[与你的外国驾照一起使用].
