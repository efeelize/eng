# Travel_visa_interview

# I.Manners and conversational style during visa interviews
# 1.Make eye contact. 
> In American culture, looking someone in the eye means your being candid and honest. 

# 2.Be polite and don't argue. 
> The officer has an important job, so be respectful.

# 3 Answer only the question. 
> The officer has many people to see, so keep your answers short and clear.

# 4 Be honest. 
> Officers can be very forgiving if you tell the truth. Also, they are trained to know when someone lies.

# 5 Mind your body language. 
> Don't fidget or make unnecessary body movements.

# 6.Avoid casual slang. 
> You may have learned some great slang, but it's best to avoid it. .

# 7.If you made a mistake, don't make excuses. 
> Say, "I'm sorry, I didn't know," if that is the case. 

# 8.Don't get nervous. 
> Don't be a robot. Smile and be confident! Visa officers [签证官] can be quite friendly!

# II.grammar
# 1.While
> We use while to talk about long actions that happen at the same time.You can also put the ‘while' clause first. The clause you say first needs to include the noun[你还可以先说while从句；放在句首的从句需要有名词]

- While Cathy was playing in the garden, she broke her arm.

- While playing in the garden, Cathy broke her arm.

> 2)you can’’t shorten the ‘while' (dependent) clause because the subjects (the people in the house (they) and the person who broke into the house) are different.[这里就不能缩写while从句，因为从句和主句主语是不一样的，一个是主人，一个是闯进屋子的人。]

- While the owners were having a nap, somebody broke into the house. 

- Somebody broke into the house while the owners were having a nap. 

# 2.consulate /'kɑnsələt/ [n.领事馆] & embassy /'ɛmbəsi/ [n.大使馆] & consular /'kɔnsjulə/ [adj.领事的] & consular officer [n.签证官]
> 1)the consulate is a little more like a division or a smaller version.And they do the day-to-day things.All personal staff. Like issuing visas that kind of thing, like all the little things that are too small for the embassy to do.

> 2）basically an embassy, usually there's one per country.In the capital, yeah, region, and the embassy does the bigger job, like the more political job.

# 3.residing /rɪ'zaɪd/  [v.居住在] & resident /'rɛzɪdənt/ [n. 居民] & residence /'rɛzɪdəns/ [n. 住处]
> 1)residing is just a formal way to say living a place.

> 2) the person residing somewhere is a resident. if you want to live in the US or some place permanently forever, you can become a permanent resident.so you're not a citizen, but you're close.

> 3) resident and a place where you live can be called a residence.

# 4.10days & 10 nights 
> 1)the tourist says," I'm planning to travel for ten days."

> 2)You can also say nights, you don't have to say days, you could say nights, like I'm gonna be there for nine nights.And it basically means would you use nights when you're referring to a place where you're gonna sleep.

> 3)And often I hear a lot of students say," Oh, I'll be gone for two nights three days." But you don't actually have to say both. You can choose one.

# 5.booking [v.预定] & confirmation /ˌkɑnfɚ'meʃən/  [n.证明] & recognition /ˌrɛkəɡ'nɪʃən/ [n.认可，赏识] & recognize /'rɛkəg'naɪz/ [v.]
> 1)so book is just reserve.and usually there's money involved, sometimes booking you pay when you book it, sometimes you, you have to just give your credit card information and you pay when you arrive.sometimes if you make an appointment, you want to book an appointment and also to make a reservation at a restaurant, you book a table.

> 2)confirmation is usually a uncountable noun, but you can use it as like a countable, I have many confirmations.Because the separate ones, some for your flights, some for your hotels.

> 3)to give someone recognition means to tell them they've done a good job or they've done something well.So to give someone recognition, you recognize, you know what they've done. So recognize would be the verb, your boss might come over and say, "Hey! you did a really great job last week". You say,"Thanks boss"! So that be recognition from your boss, and recognition's really important in the workplace. Let's give a maybe one more example of recognition here, shall we?

# 6.letter of employment [n.在职证明] & supporting document [n.相关文件] & bank statements [n.银行对账单] &  &  tax return [n.纳税申报单] &  property deed [n.财产证书，房产证] & the title to your property  /'prɑpɚti/ [房产证]
> 1)So basically all this means is proof of employment.it's like a could be a contractor, even a letter you can ask your boss to just sign the letter.you're gonna go back and also that you have money. Basically, it also shows you have some money.when you're applying for a visa because they want you to have enough money to, you know, if something happens, and just to entertain /ˌɛntɚ'ten/ [v.招待] yourself that do things, they don't want you to be stranded./'strændɪd/ [adj.搁浅]

> 2)Support is like to give approval or help to something.There're just papers that prove you are financially stable.Exactly, it could be legal documents, another way we use support, it like my parents supported me financially, or if there's a criminal court case, there's supporting evidence [n.证据] that, you know, helps.

> 3) bank statements :it's just your bank account information. it's just your bank account information.How much money you have printed out? It's just something in print, not hand written, that they can see is true.

> 4)a tax return is a document where you write your income for the year.and then they gave you the government, send you a formal letter to say what your income was for last year. 

> 5)so this is again another legal document, it proves that you own some property. the deed [n.契约], proves your ownership of some land or a condo /'kɑndo/ [n.公寓] or something apartment.

> 6)and we may also say the title to your property.

# 7.method /'mɛθəd/ 
> pick up methods[选择取证方式], the way how you do something, so we have a very common expression, you know, sometimes if you don't understand what someone is doing and why they're doing it, you can say there must be a method to their madness.so why are they doing this? There must be a reason.
