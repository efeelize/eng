# I.Getting gas in America without a zip code[n.邮政编码]
> Over the years Americans have become used to entering their zip code when they are paying at the pump[加油]. They have been told by the credit card companies and gas stations that it is for their own security, although not everyone believes that. But what if you are a traveler from another country? Is it impossible to buy gas? Well, not exactly. Many credit card companies post information on their website about how to create a special code that looks like a zip code. If your credit card still doesn't allow you to do that, most of the time you can still use your foreign credit card inside the station. Of course, at the end of the day if you are paying cash, no one will ask you your zip code or any other personal information. That's why cash is king!

> Because for a long time gas was really really expensive. And I mean I know you guys know that but a lot of people want to steal gas or steal credit cards to, you know just to buy gas with them.Yeah, you used to be able to like a long time ago used to be able to fill up before paying, but now you kind of have to like pay before filling up. So before people could fill up and then drive off with the gas.yeah, but there's no no trust anymore, right?

> Yeah, anyway I don't think we actually mentioned what a zip code is exactly, so zip code...if you have an address, if you have like a home or an apartment in America, that address is going to be in, that's going to be located in a zip code. And the zip codes are usually, the area is usually not too big, you know, might be the size of a big neighborhood, something like that. So basically your your bank card will be linked or registered with your address in which case it will have a zip code attached to it.

> so guys if you are ever in America and you're looking to put gas in a car, and you are using may be a foreign bank card, you should first find a, you should find the staff, you should find a gas station attendant. Maybe go go up to the cashier and then pay pay at the window because your card will not work at the pump probably.

> There is...I mean because actually if Canadians go to the States, we also have this problem. This is not only a, you know, a Chinese tourist problem. There're like actual instructions, you know, I know all of these Canadian bank websites on, you know, what to do and you can kind of make up a zip code.

# II.grammar
# 1.gas & gasoline & gas station & petrol /'pɛtrəl/ & diesel /'dizl/ [n.柴油]
> 1)Yeah, so why don't they say we were running low on gasoline?Oh right. Yes, gasoline is just long and kind of awkward so.We kind of, you know short in this word here. We just say gas.

> 2)There is a gas station up ahead. We don't say gasoline station or you know like add oil station, it's always gas station.Yeah, we certainly don't say petrol.

> 3)but you can't put diesel gas into a regular car. It's gonna ruin, it's gonna ruin the car.

# 2.refill your car & fill sth up [phr.装满、加满]
> 1)Well you can refill it, you can also fill it up. Fill her up, fill her up. We like to call cars like girl names, it's just something that we do we don't really say fill him up but yeah.

> 2)It Just means just put the gas in and that's it just make sure the tank is full.Filling something up means to put something into a kind of container. Remember that in America, people often think of their cars as being female. As such, instead of saying "fill it up," many people will say "fill 'er up" (the "h" isn't pronounced, so it sounds more like "filler up")[在美国,人们想到车，一般都是女性化的，所以不要说 "fill it up," 而要说 "fill 'er up"，这里h不发音，听起来就好像 "filler up"]

- Did you fill the car up with regular or supreme?

# 3.first and foremost [phr.最基础的、最重要的]
> Ok, here first and foremost, so this means like most importantly.

# 4.supreme /sə'prim/  [adj.最高级别]
> 1)While we are talking about like what we have...what's called regular, plus and supreme.so regular is that's the gas I get, I'm not gonna pay for any of that, plus or supreme, regular is just regular.And then we have plus which is a little better than regular and then there's supreme.Yeah, if you have like a Ferrari, you should put supreme in there not regular.

> 2)supreme court:so supreme ok is like yeah the highest, it's the greatest. You know, really good, right? So maybe maybe some of you have heard of the supreme court in America.So it's like the highest court. 

> 3)supreme pizza. So it's a type of pizza that you can get in America or Canada. Maybe I don't know, even I don't even buy pizza here in China, but maybe they have supreme pizza. But you kind of get like everything on it or close to everything. You know there's vegetables, there's meats, there's this and that you know a lot of cheese, supreme pizza.

> 4)supreme deal:I haven't talked to you to, you know the marketing department at Open Language for a long time, but I know we were always doing one year, 629 RMB that's a pretty supreme deal in my opinion.It's a really good deal, right?

> 5)supreme leader:maybe have like a really high leader, maybe like the king of a country. You could say he's like the supreme leader, you know he's number one.like in North Korea.

# 5.underneath
> nd so here Bob says they've got numbers underneath, right? So 87 is regular, 89 is plus, 91 and 93 is supreme.

# 6.liter /'litɚ/ [n.公升] & gallon /ˈɡælən/ [n.加仑]
> 1)liter: I mean a liter is basically one thousand milliliters /ˈmɪləˌlitɚ/ [n.毫升]. It's part of the metric /'mɛtrɪk/ [adj.公制的；米制] system.

> 2)gallon: I think a gallon might be like 3.8 liters roughly. It's roughly 4 liters and then yeah gallon, so this is a measuring unit that we use in America. If you've ever been to America and you've gone to a grocery store and you see really big bottles of milk, those are gallons. You might see a big bottle of orange juice it's also a gallon.

# 7.pump
> so the pump is basically the machine that pumps gas into your car, right? The gas pump.I guess it's not so easy when you're in a different country. But I think most gas pumps now at least in America are are all pretty much the same, right? You just put in your credit card.

# 8.zip code [n.邮政编码]
> yeah, but he was also having issues with that. And I could see how this would be an issue because it does ask for you as zip code. If you have a foreign foreign bank card, foreign credit card. You probably can't put in a US zip code to use the card at the pump, so you would have to find a worker or like a gas station attendant. But I don't think there's anyone working at the station right now because its a self service station.Ok, so I mean maybe there's a person there but usually a self serve station can just be, you're just serving yourself.Yeah yeah, not a bad thing. Okay, but either way he says there's no one even around to help them, so they're gonna go look for a different station that's staffed.

# 9.self service
> Yes, self service basically you you help yourself. There's some other self serve places, maybe you go to a buffet /bə'fe/[n.自助餐]. To eat a bunch of food, 自助餐, and you serve yourself. You get whatever you want to eat basically.

# 10.staff [n. & v.]
> 1)Okay, so you guys all know staff, right? Keep in mind when we're talking about staff. We don't say staffs, there's no s. Staff is just staff, right?Yeah, you can even say we're running low on staff.

> 2)But it can also be a verb, right? Like you can staff a place, you can hire all of the people to go work at that place by staffing it.Right. That's right and if you have staffed it then it is staffed.staff an office,Any company could be staffed, often times when there are not enough people, we say that...I were working at this gas station. I might say sorry we're a little short staffed today.

# 11.put sth back [phr.放归原处] & turn sth on/off [phr.开/关]
> 1）put sth back：There are many things to use at the gas station. When you have finished using them, you always must return them to the place where you found them, or more naturally, put them back.

> 2)turn sth on/off：Many languages use the word "open" to talk about starting something (like a car, or some lights). English is not one of them! Remember, "turn on the car" means start the car.

> 3)Just remember that with these phrasal verbs, the object can go in the middle or at the end. However, if you want to use a pronoun instead of a proper noun - like "it" for example - it MUST go in the middle. You can't say "fill up it" or "turn off it."[要记住这些动词短语，宾语可以放在中间，也可以放在末尾，但是，不要把代词放在末尾。代词一定要放在中间。 "fill up it" 或者"turn off it"都是不可以的.]

- You can't pay for the gas until you put the nozzle /'nɑzl/ [n.喷嘴] back on the pump.
- I put the wrong card into the machine.
- Try putting the card in again.
- I can't believe you forgot to trun off the car when you were pumping gas!

# III.pattern
***We're running low on gas.***

***Well, there's a gas station up ahead. We'll make a quick stop and fill up. Alright, here we are.***

***Do they use the same numbering system as in China?***

***Um, I'm not sure. Well, first and foremost, we want gasoline, not diesel.***

***Yes, of course. Look, they have regular, plus and supreme.***

***Those must be the different grades. Look, they've got numbers underneath.***

***So 87 is regular gas; 89 is plus; and 91 to 93 is supreme.***

***That's slightly different than in China. But I think we can just go with regular. This isn't a fancy car after all.***

***Agreed. How much is it per liter?***

***It's $2.5 per gallon. But how do you work the pump?***

***You need to put a credit card in first. Here's mine.***

***Um, it's asking me to enter a US zip code.***

***But we don't have one.***

***Yeah. Well, it's not working. This is a self-service station. There's no one around to even help.***

***Let's try to find a different station that's staffed then.***
