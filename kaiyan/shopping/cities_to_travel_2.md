# I.The best cities to visit in 2020 
# 1.Bonn /bɑn/ [n.波恩], Germany
> Once capital of West Germany, Bonn slipped off [phr.溜走；滑落] the radar [淡出了众人视线] when Berlin reseized the reins [重新掌权] in 1990. But it's back in the spotlight /'spɑtlaɪt/ [n.公众注意的中心] in 2020, as the city gears up [phr.准备好] to mark Beethoven /'bei,təuvən/ [贝多芬]'s 250th birthday. Well, you can expect a year-round [全年无休] line-up [v.排成行] of concerts drawing world-famous orchestras /'ɔrkɪstrə/ [n.管弦乐队], soloists /'soloɪst/ [n.独唱者；独奏者] and conductors /kən'dʌktɚ/ [n.(乐队)指挥]. 

# 2.La Paz /lə ˈpɑz/ [拉巴斯], Bolivia /bəˈlɪviə/
> Perhaps it's the Jetsonian [杰森式吊舱] gliding /'ɡlaɪdɪŋ/ [adj.流畅的] over La Paz along the world's largest cable-car system [缆车系统] that are the most obvious signs of its new-found ambition [重拾野心]. There were just three lines in 2014, but there will be 11 in 2020. Down below[缆车下], the once-drab /dræb/ [单调乏味的] city is racing towards a more radiant and inspired future [正迈向更加灿烂明媚的未来]. Everyone from a flamboyant /flæm'bɔɪənt/ [adj.(人或物)显眼的,浮夸的,炫耀的] self-taught architect to the budding /'bʌdɪŋ/ [adj.初露头角的] chefs leaving new culinary /'kʌlɪnɛri/ [adj.烹饪的] schools is thriving here.

# 3.Dubai, UAE [abbr.阿拉伯联合酋长国（United Arab Emirates）]
> The future is now in Dubai as the superlative-craving emirate /'ɛmərət/ [n.酋长国] launches several boundary-pushing marquee /mɑr'ki/ projects [开拓创新的大项目] in 2020. Top billing, of course, goes to the six-month-long World Expo 2020[为期6个月的2020年世博会], where 190 nations go all out in showcasing /'ʃokes/ [n.(商店或博物馆的)玻璃陈列柜] the latest visions in sustainability [可持续发展] and mobility [机动性] (think: flying cars) in architecturally /ˌɑrkə'tɛktʃərəli/ [adv.建筑上] showstopping [adj.〈褒〉因特别精彩而被观众的掌声打断的] pavilions /pə'vɪlɪən/ [展示馆].

[迪拜预计还将开放未来博物馆，这座镌刻着阿拉伯书法的建筑形如一只眼睛，聚焦新世代的种种奇迹]

# II.Los Angeles: The Movie Capital of America
> For over a century, LA has been the center of the movie universe. Hollywood not only has great power in American culture, but also in cultures around the world. Of course the question many people ask is "why Hollywood?" Why not New York, for example: another great cultural city in America. There are actually two pretty good reasons. One, a hundred years ago, the technology used to make movies was owned and controlled by the inventor Thomas Edison. As a result, he refused to allow people to use his technology to make movies that he couldn't control. However, Edison lived in New Jersey, on the east coast of America. California, remember, is on the west coast, far away from Mr. Edison's control. That might be the reason filmmakers went to California, but the reason they remained is because of the weather. Unlike New York, where winter would make it difficult to shoot movies, In California, you can shoot movies all throughout the year.

There's actually you know quite a bit to do, there's a lot of awesome restaurants, it's a really international city because of all the different you know diplomats and stuff from around the world, different government organizations there.

> And night life really isn't too bad either, so if you guys are young and you like to go out at night you know may be drinking a bit feel free to check out neighborhoods such as Dupont circle, or you can go to U Street. That's where Ben's Chili Bowl is, also another famous neighborhood for its night life is called Adams Morgan.I know right there's a popular bar in Adams Morgan called Madams Organ.

We actually had a cliff there's like a, at least I don't know it's about forty depending on how high the water is, a forty to fifty foot cliff that we would jump off of into the river.

> Anyway,D.C. is a city that has a lot of nature to offer too, so I think it's a nice balance.

# 1.National Zoo [国家动物园]
> If you're travelling with the kids, The National Zoo needs to be on your list of places to visit. Located in Rock Creek National Park, it is home to over 400 species of animals. Many people don't know that this is also a Smithsonian institution, which might explain the ticket price [完全免费]!
