# I.What types of travel insurance are available?
# 1.All inclusive travel insurance 全包型旅行保险
> A comprehensive policy that offers emergency medical coverage plus insurance against logistical [物流] problems, like lost or stolen baggage, trip cancellations /ˌkænsə'leʃən/ [取消], and travel interruptions[中断]. Since all inclusive insurance has the most extensive coverage, premiums/'primɪəm/ [保费]  tend to be higher than for other travel policies.

# 2.Trip cancellation and interruption insurance 旅行取消和中断险
> This insurance reimburses /ˌriɪm'bɝs/ [v.补偿] you for your flight and travel expenses if you have to cancel your trip for a covered reason. Some policies also pay benefits for food and lodging /'lɑdʒɪŋ/ costs [餐宿费] if your trip is interrupted or delayed. Those policies may even cover you if your tour operator suddenly files /faɪl/ for bankruptcy.

# 3.Top-up insurance 追加保险
> Purchased by travelers who already have insurance for a portion /'pɔrʃən/, but not for the entire duration [覆盖到旅程全程], of their trip. Top-up insurance takes effect after the original coverage lapses /læp/ [原保险失效].

***Hey Chloe, I heard you’re going to Europe soon.***

***Yeah, I’m applying for the Schengen Visa, but I need to buy travel insurance first as required.***

***What does the insurance cover?***

***Just the usual unexpected things, like lost or stolen luggage, flight delays, and medical treatment.***

***So how much are the premiums?***

***It varies depending on the length of your trip: usually the longer the trip the better deal you’ll get. Anyway, it’s quite reasonable. Probably less than 20€ for up to 15 days.***

***That’s not bad at all. But I don’t think Canada and the US require travel insurance for tourist visas.***

***Really? But still, it’s better to be safe than sorry.***

***I hear you. Hope everything goes smoothly and have a great trip!***

***Thanks! I just can’t wait to get over there.***
