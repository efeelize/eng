# Travel_insurance

# I.What types of travel insurance are available?
# 1.All inclusive travel insurance 全包型旅行保险
> A comprehensive policy that offers emergency medical coverage plus insurance against logistical [物流] problems, like lost or stolen baggage, trip cancellations /ˌkænsə'leʃən/ [取消], and travel interruptions[中断]. Since all inclusive insurance has the most extensive coverage, premiums/'primɪəm/ [保费]  tend to be higher than for other travel policies.

# 2.Trip cancellation and interruption insurance 旅行取消和中断险
> This insurance reimburses /ˌriɪm'bɝs/ [v.补偿] you for your flight and travel expenses if you have to cancel your trip for a covered reason. Some policies also pay benefits for food and lodging /'lɑdʒɪŋ/ costs [餐宿费] if your trip is interrupted or delayed. Those policies may even cover you if your tour operator suddenly files /faɪl/ for bankruptcy.

# 3.Top-up insurance 追加保险
> Purchased by travelers who already have insurance for a portion /'pɔrʃən/, but not for the entire duration [覆盖到旅程全程], of their trip. Top-up insurance takes effect after the original coverage lapses /læp/ [原保险失效].

# II.grammar 
# 1.Schengen Visa [n.申根签证]
> this special visa in Europe called the Shengen or Schengen visa.because this is not an English word, you are going to be lots of ways to pronounce it in English, as long as you guys are clear. Its basically means a European visa.

# 2.cover [v.覆盖]
> 1)If you're ever gonna get an insurance you need to know this word, this may be the most important word to,to ask before getting insurance, and it just what does it include?

> 2)We can also use it for things like topics, if you're reading a book about a subject you can ask what topics does this book cover or what kind of things are included?or I mean even beyond the book, write a lecture, some kind of some kind of speech. Today, we're going to cover all sorts of interesting topics.

- 1. The science lecture covered a range of topics and related them together.[一系列相互关联的主题]。

- 2. My phone coverage [信号] is poor as soon as I go up into the mountains. 

- 3. My house insurance covers home break-ins and accidental fire. 

# 3.luggage & baggage
> 1)The the one thing to keep in mind guys it doesn't matter if you are saying luggage or baggage, you will never ever ever ever say luggages or baggages.They are noncountable or uncountable.

> 2)Also we only say luggage or baggage when you're transporting them during travel, like you wouldn't you wouldn't go to school and say "oh I forgot my baggage" or something. It's only during travel.

# 4.medical treatment [n.治疗]
> 1)if it serious then you got to go to the hospital, and get more serious medical treatment.

> 2)We can also use treatment in a different way, like if you are if someone's behaving in a certain way, in a nice way or a negative way, like if you get special treatment at work because the boss is your father, something like that.

# 5.premiums /'primɪəm/ [n.保险费]
> this is also a special word or specialized word just means the price right? Or the rate of you know how much does it cost.

# 6.varies between / with 
> 1)so the thing about vary you can't just use it for everything, it's usually for things have the same type, like for example apples, apples vary in size and color, or laws vary in different States.

> 2)The most interesting thing about this word is it can take so many different prepositions /ˌprɛpə'zɪʃən/ [n.介词]. So we mentioned a few already other will be some more in the expansion section. You might hear something like you know it varies between... you know apples vary between sweet apples and sour apples. It could be varies with... right? The size of the apple varies with the weather.

- 1. All the products we tested varied in quality but were overall well-made.

- 2. Local laws vary from city to city, but are generally similar.

- 3. Crime rates vary with the economy and education of a city.

# 7.better to be safe than sorry [phr.宁可事先谨慎有余，不要事后悔] & it better safe than sorry
> 1)this is a great great expression you can use this in so many situations. So it just means that you know after an accident, something unexpected people have regret or they have sorrow, yeah, and that's where that word sorry comes from sorrow, being sad.

> 2)And it's pretty much a fixed expression here, you always say it's better to be safe sorry or you know better to be safe and sorry even though it may cost you more money.I'd say it like have you ever heard it without the to be like it better safe than sorry.for sure,Better safe and sorry, better to be safe than sorry, the key words here are better safe than sorry.

# 8.I hear you [phr.我明白了]
> 1) I would suggest that you guys be a little careful with the words stress. You don't want to stress "you", like I hear you.that would mean literally with my ears, I can hear what you're saying.

> 2) it's kind of more like you want to stress "I", even here might have a little bit of I hear you.

# 9.wish you a smooth /smʊð/ trip & hope everything goes smoothly /'smʊðli/
> actually probably say this more commonly, goes smoothly. Yeah, so it just means without any problems.

***Hey Chloe, I heard you’re going to Europe soon.***

***Yeah, I’m applying for the Schengen Visa, but I need to buy travel insurance first as required.***

***What does the insurance cover?***

***Just the usual unexpected things, like lost or stolen luggage, flight delays, and medical treatment.***

***So how much are the premiums?***

***It varies depending on the length of your trip: usually the longer the trip the better deal you’ll get. Anyway, it’s quite reasonable. Probably less than 20€ for up to 15 days.***

***That’s not bad at all. But I don’t think Canada and the US require travel insurance for tourist visas.***

***Really? But still, it’s better to be safe than sorry.***

***I hear you. Hope everything goes smoothly and have a great trip!***

***Thanks! I just can’t wait to get over there.***
