# Blind_date.
# I.Quick facts on dating culture in the US 
# 1.Marriage is not (always) the ultimate goal
> American people will think through and through before they decide to get married. They will make sure that their partner is the right one worth spending their life with. Thus, people who date in America are not all ended up being married. 

# 2.Parents' involvement is minimal [父母基本不参与其中]
> In some countries, parents are deeply involved in their children's relationship. They even become the matchmaker /'mætʃ'mekɚ/ [媒人] between their children and set up the marriage [包办婚姻] for them. In the US, once you hit 18 and become a legal adult, you are free to make a decision on your own. Parents do not involve much in their children's dating.

# 3.Your pet takes part in your relationships
> Believe it or not, your home pet takes part in the longevity of your relationship. When you move in together with your partner, its part in your relationship becomes bigger. A few American couples break up because they don't like the pet that their partner has. So, make sure that your partner doesn’t only love you but your pet as well.

# II.grammar
# 1.seeing [v.交往]
> 1)This word here "seeing," it's another way to say "dating,"Usually in the early part of the relationship before it gets really serious.and we usually use this in the progressive, like "Have you been seeing anyone?" "Are you seeing anyone?"We don't say "Do you see anyone?"

> 2)So this word "seeing" goes really well with "lately" or "recently," seeing anyone lately, seeing anyone recently.And you can use this in a question too, Like, "How long has she been seeing him?"she's been seeing him for a couple weeks.

# 2.scene [n.景色、场合] & dating scene [n.约会场合]
> 1)Now the word "scene," you might have seen in the phrase "movie scene."There are lots of scenes there. Like you said a part of a movie, it could be a view like a gorgeous scene on the mountain.

> 2)But when we're talking about the dating scene, this is the situation where you are looking around for a date.It just means situation. this is what you're doing these days. Or I personally don't really go to clubs very much because clubs are not really my scene.

> 3)maybe if you just broke up with someone, you might want to get back into the dating scene.

# 3.set sb up on/go on a blind date [phr.安排和别人约会] & set sb up with a job/friends
> 1)So a blind date is just a date with someone that you haven't met before or you haven't spoken to before.It doesn't really mean that the date is blind, that she or he cannot see anything. We often use blind like if the sun is really bright and it's shining in your eyes, we say "Oh, the sun was blinding. I can't see."But a blind date is different from online dating, Because with online dating, you usually talk to the person before.And you can at least see a picture.

> 2)to set sb up,this means to arrange a meeting,so usually we say "go on a date" or "set someone up on a date."You can set someone up with, but that is used in different situations.I could set you up with my friend.Or you can set somebody up with a job.So "with" can be used for people or jobs, but we use "on" with the word "date."

# 4.picky [adj.挑剔的] & I have a type [phr.有自己喜欢的类型]
> 1)So if you're picky, there's like a lot of people or a lot of things you just don't like. For example, I could say he's picky about food. He doesn't eat seafood and vegetable.maybe like, when I go shopping for clothes, I'm a little picky, cause some clothes just don't look good on me.

> 2)So if you say "I have a type," it means there is a specific kind of person that you like. I mean you could say "Oh, she's totally his type" or "He's totally her type."

# 5.easygoing [adj.随和的]
> when someone's easygoing, they don't get mad easily. They don't get stressed out easily.If you're someone that always says, "Don't worry about it, and it's okay. No problem." then maybe you're easygoing.But we only use easygoing for people.We can't use it for things like I can't say "I went on an easygoing date."It's really just for personalities exactly.

# 6.a sense of sth sight / smell /taste /direction
> 1)Sense.It really just means feeling or in this case ability almost,ike ability to understand,and we often use this phrase "a sense of something." Like, we all have a sense of sight or smell or taste. 

> 2)But it could also be humor is like an ability, so it could be a sense of direction.So if you have no sense of direction, it means you can't understand directions and you often get lost. If you get lost a lot, maybe you don't have a good sense of direction, maybe you need your smartphone.

# 7.on paper [phr.理论上]
> 1)"on paper," it means in theory or the idea. It should be fine but maybe it's not.When you actually do something, it doesn't always work out the way you thought, or the way it was on paper.you can also think about your dating profiles.And maybe when you look at their profile, hey, it looks like we're going to be a good match, we are a good match on paper. But when you actually meet the person, it's not the same.

> 2)If you're talking about a job interview,I might say he looks good on paper but we'll see how he does in the job interview. So when I say he looks good on paper, I mean his resume looks good.maybe he has a great resume, but he's really awkward and he is not very good with people.

# 8.you guys would really click [v.合得来] & we have chemistry
> 1)Click" is a word we use a lot. It means get along well.especially with romantic couples,It could be a friend maybe, like "My friend and I didn't click,"  But maybe if you meet someone at the bar, you might just click.

> 2)There's another phrase we use, that is "We have chemistry."So that one is like more often used for romantic relationships.

# 9.commit to goals/job [v.承诺] & commitment [n.]
> 1)So here she's talking about committing to a relationship, and that means to promise to be with that person."Commit" really just means promise. When you do something that's hard to do, like, losing weight or staying healthy and eating, it's hard to commit to those goals.It's hard to promise to do them and continue to do them. Now you can also commit to a job, and that is when you promise to stay with this job, like maybe for a long time and work hard.

> 2)the noun of this word "commit" is "commitment." For example, getting a dog or a pet is a big commitment.Or getting married is a big commitment.

# 10.to give/have a shot [phr.试试看]
> 1)to "give it a shot," this just means to try it.I think of like sports, like, he shoots, he scores or maybe he didn't score. When you shoot, when you give it a shot, you're just trying.So you might try to shoot in that sense.

> 2)You can sometimes say "have a shot," like "I had a shot at it but it didn't work."
