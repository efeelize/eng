# Buying_alcohol
# I.Where in the United States you can't purchase alcohol
> There are 10 states in the U.S. that allow dry[adj.禁酒的] counties /'kaʊnti/ [n. 郡, 县], according to the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association[美国国家酒精饮料控制协会]. An additional 15 states are “partially dry,” having some alcohol controls[部分禁酒].

> In the following image, blue counties are wet[不禁酒], red counties are dry, and yellow counties are either partially dry, with some alcohol restrictions, or have municipalities /mjʊ'nɪsə'pæləti/ [n.自治市;自治区] within them that are dry.

> Some states began allowing counties and cities to ban alcohol sales following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, while in others, like Alaska and Mississippi, municipalities didn’t start going dry until the 1960s and 1980s[20世纪60年代和80年代], respectively[分别]. But the trend in many of these dry areas is toward loosening restrictions, the National AlcoholBeverage Control Association says.

> “While there may always be dry localities in the United States, they are getting fewer and far between[但数量却越来越稀少],” according to a March report from thegroup.

> In Maryland, for example, the last dry town, Damascus /də'mæskəs/ [大马士革], became wet in 2012, and Kansas /ˈkænzəz/[n.堪萨斯州] has seen more than a dozen counties go wet in the past decade. Advocates in Arkansas /ˈɑ:kənsɔ:/ /ˈɑrkənˌsɔ/ [阿肯色州] hope their state will join that list.

# II.grammer
# 1.booze [n & v. ] / boozy [adj.喝醉的] / tanked [adj. 喝醉的]
> 1)booze:it just means alcohol.we don't really say alcohol,cause alcohol is like the chemical name.Yeah, and actually it can be a verb too. If you're going to go get drunk, if you're going to go drink a lot, you could say:" Oh, you know, we're going to go boozing. Yeah so booze, either way just means alcohol, very colloquial /kə'lokwɪəl/ [adj.口语] , very spoken term here for the word alcohol. Cause actually Connor, if you think about it, if you're going to go to the store with your friends, you're probably not going to say:"Hey, let's go buy some alcohol." It's the most kind of formal, right?Yeah alcohol is actually too formal, so we just say booze or we just say wine or beer or liquor.

> 2)boozy、:we even can change it to an adjective when we say boozy, b-o-o-z-y, that means I was kind of drunk, I was a bit boozy last night.

# 2.stock up on sth [phr.囤货] / in stock
> 1）stock up:Yeah, this is used all the time. When you buy things for the future, like especially food or drinks.Right, you buy a lot because you need to be prepared.

# 3.liquor /'lɪkɚ/ & hard stuff  [n.烈性酒] &  soft drinks
> 1)so liquor is just like that hard stuff, right? Like vodka /'vɑdkə/ and whiskey /'hwɪski/.

> 2)hard stuff:Ok, but hard stuff though, so that's just another term for liquor. Okay, so we talked a bit about liquor, so our friend here Grant, he says as for the hard stuff, he says I think some whiskey, tequila, vodka, wow that's a lot, will do the trick.Yeah so as for it's just like an expression, it means kind of like a regarding?Yeah, it's kind of like while talking about this, yeah with regards to that, but it's much more casual, you wouldn't say with regards to the alcohol, I think we should blah blah blah blah, no, you would say as for the booze or as for the hard stuff.

> 3)soft drinks:Yeah, I can't say that people ever really say, you know, oh I'm drinking this soft stuff.Right, the only soft we uses, soft drink and that's just for like coca cola.Yeah, some type of soda. 

# 4.varietals  /və'raɪətəl/ [n.品种] / variety 
> 1)But in these categories, there's many different types of red[n.红酒] and many different types of white[n.白葡萄酒], what word do we use for these differences?Right, yeah, I think you said it to, it's the word varietals.

> 2)variety:I mean it looks the same too, but it's more like specific to wine.Well, I like Pinot Grigio.So for example, My favourite varietal is Cabernet /'kæbərnei/ [n.赤霞珠,红酒]ow about you? Well, I like Pinot Grigio / ˈpiːnəʊ ˈɡriːdʒəʊ / [灰比诺，白葡萄酒] You wouldn't say what varietal of clothing do you wear? Or what varietal of sports do you like? Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, definitely not. 

# 5.Cabernet /'kæbərnei/ & Pinot Grigio / ˈpiːnəʊ ˈɡriːdʒəʊ / 
> 1)Cabernet is a red wine and just a note on the spelling there, Cabernet is French, so we spell it as C-a-b-e-r-n-e-t, but we say Cabernet.Yeah, not caber-ne-t.

> 2)Pinot Grigio:which is a white wine.We do not say Pi-not, Pinot Grigio.

# 6.crowd-pleasers
> Yeah that's right. So a crowd is like a bunch of people and if they're pleased, they're happy, they're satisfied, so these two wines, you can't really go wrong with them, they're kind of like the standard typical wine that most people enjoy.Yeah yeah, and it's not really about how fancy or good they are, just everybody always likes them. OK, so they are crowd pleasers.

# 7.IPA
> So IPA, this isn't an abbreviation /ə'brivɪ'eʃən/.

> 1)what is a fella. It just basically like a friendly way to say a guy or a man.

> 2)Yeah and it comes from the word fellow.Yeah, fellow is just like... kind of like a friend?Right, but a male friend, you wouldn't call a girl who's your friend, you wouldn't call her a fellow right?That is a very good point, yeah, fellows or fellas are guys.

# 10.light beer [n.低度啤酒]
> Yeah, I mean some ladies like IPA's or beers really pack a punch, but I mean generally maybe it's safe to say that a lot of ladies like light beer, which just means it's easy to drink.

# 11.higher proof [n.稍高度数] / lower proof [n.稍低度数]
> 1)proof: it's a word that we use to talk about how much alcohol is in, you know, the beer or the wine or the liquor that you're drinking right?Yeah, exactly, like if were drinking something strong, something that really packs a punch like vodka, the proof is I think 80?

> 2）higher proof：Well, depending on the flavor. It might not be true, it might not taste too good, but it doesn't have a lot of alcohol, so it's lower in proof and it has less calories, oh yeah but IPA's are higher in proof, they have a higher proof and usually more calories.

> 3)lower proof：Right, so it's just kind of a system for measuring the alcohol and it doesn't use percent, so we just say higher proof, lower proof and like this other phrase, less calories.

# 12.calories
> So calories are in pretty much everything that you eat.It's like a measure of like energy right?Yeah, how much energy is in the food that you're eating, a simple example, chocolate has more calories than a carrot.Yeah, butter is a lot of calories.

# 14.tequila /tə'kilə/ [n.龙舌兰] & vodka  /'vɑdkə/ &  whiskey /'hwɪski/ 
> 1）tequila, that's really from one place, isn't it?Yeah pretty much, just comes from good old Mexico. 

> 2) vodka: I think most people know that that is like the drink in Russia and places like Poland and probably the Ukraine? I guess it probably originated or first came from Russia, but now I mean you have popular vodkas that come from France and even America actually, there's vodka from all over, either way these three types of hard liquors will do the trick.

# 15.do the trick [phr.奏效]
> Oh do the trick, this is a really awesome expression. It just means they will do the job well.

> Yeah so and it doesn't just have to be alcohol and getting drunk or something like that. For example, if you're sick, you know a doctor might give you some medicine and say here, take this medicine, it will do the trick.

# III.pattern
***What kind of booze should we stock up on for the party this weekend?***

***I'd say a little bit of everything,You know,wine,beer,liquor.That way everyone's happy.***

***So for wine,we should probably get a red and a white.But which varietals?***

***I'd say just go with a Cabernet and a Pinot Grigio.They are always crowd -pleasures.***

***How about IPA's for the fellas and some sort of light beer for the ladies?***

***As for the hard stuff,I think some whiskey,tequila and vodka will do the trick.***

***Agreed,and if anyone wants to drink anyting else,they can always BYOB.***

> Ok, Spencer, so we've talked a lot about alcohol I think, and I think I've revealed a little bit about what I like, I like the beers and I don't know, are you more of a wine, beer or liquor guy?

> Oh, you know, a little bit of this little bit of that, I'm not a really big drinker anymore, but I did bartend /'bɑ:tend/ [n.酒保] for a number of years, so I do know a lot about all different kinds of alcohol really? I like Guinness /'ɡinis/ [吉尼斯黑啤酒（英国产强性黑啤酒的一种）] and I like Jameson ['dʒeimsn], Irish whiskey, I kind of keep it simple with that, yeah but a nice cocktail or two could be OK, but I don't like things that are too sweet.

> Oh, yeah yeah yeah me neither. I think it really for me depends on the situation. If I'm finished work and I just want to relax at home, I might have a glass of wine; if it's a birthday party, I might want some beer.
