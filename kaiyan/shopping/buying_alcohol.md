# I.Where in the United States you can't purchase alcohol
> There are 10 states in the U.S. that allow dry[adj.禁酒的] counties /'kaʊnti/ [n. 郡, 县], according to the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association[美国国家酒精饮料控制协会]. An additional 15 states are “partially dry,” having some alcohol controls[部分禁酒].

> In the following image, blue counties are wet[不禁酒], red counties are dry, and yellow counties are either partially dry, with some alcohol restrictions, or have municipalities /mjʊ'nɪsə'pæləti/ [n.自治市;自治区] within them that are dry.

> Some states began allowing counties and cities to ban alcohol sales following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, while in others, like Alaska and Mississippi, municipalities didn’t start going dry until the 1960s and 1980s[20世纪60年代和80年代], respectively[分别]. But the trend in many of these dry areas is toward loosening restrictions, the National AlcoholBeverage Control Association says.

> “While there may always be dry localities in the United States, they are getting fewer and far between[但数量却越来越稀少],” according to a March report from thegroup.

> In Maryland, for example, the last dry town, Damascus /də'mæskəs/ [大马士革], became wet in 2012, and Kansas /ˈkænzəz/[n.堪萨斯州] has seen more than a dozen counties go wet in the past decade. Advocates in Arkansas /ˈɑ:kənsɔ:/ /ˈɑrkənˌsɔ/ [阿肯色州] hope their state will join that list.
