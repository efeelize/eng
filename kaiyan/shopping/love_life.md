# Love_life
# I.Quick facts on dating culture in the US 
# 1.Marriage is not (always) the ultimate goal
> American people will think through and through before they decide to get married. They will make sure that their partner is the right one worth spending their life with. Thus, people who date in America are not all ended up being married. 

# 2.Parents' involvement is minimal [父母基本不参与其中]
> In some countries, parents are deeply involved in their children's relationship. They even become the matchmaker /'mætʃ'mekɚ/ [媒人] between their children and set up the marriage [包办婚姻] for them. In the US, once you hit 18 and become a legal adult, you are free to make a decision on your own. Parents do not involve much in their children's dating.

# 3.Your pet takes part in your relationships
> Believe it or not, your home pet takes part in the longevity of your relationship. When you move in together with your partner, its part in your relationship becomes bigger. A few American couples break up because they don't like the pet that their partner has. So, make sure that your partner doesn’t only love you but your pet as well.

# II.Love at first sight may have a biological basis
> It’s Saturday night and the bar is packed [挤满了人]. A beautiful brunette /bru'nɛt/ [n.黑发女郎] is sitting at the bar, sipping a vodka soda and chatting with a friend. Out of the corner of her eye, she catches the glimpse of a man. Their eyes lock.And they lived happily ever after.But is it really that easy?

> In fact, researchers who study human attraction say, people do tend to form opinions quickly [迅速形成意见] when it comes to romance. Some think it takes just three minutes to decide whether someone’s a potential mate (and that’s before the drinks arrive).

> Findings [研究] about friends who click immediately might also apply to romantic partnerships. In one study on friendships, people who enjoyed the first few minutes together were likely to develop a close relationship after nine weeks.

> But instant attraction isn’t just in our heads: There may be a biological basis [生物学基础] to love at first sight.Studies have found that animals are more likely to mate with partners they’re genetically compatible with [遗传上相容的]. It’s unclear whether this research applies to humans, but some scientists think we might be preprogrammed [先天预设] to spot “the one.” Romantic attraction might serve an evolutionary function [起到进化的作用]: We seek out [寻找] specific people who will be suitable mates, and we give everyone else the boot [踢掉其他人].

> Although about half the American population believes in love at first sight, not everyone falls head over heels right away [不是每个人都立马神魂颠倒坠入爱河].Perhaps surprisingly, women aren’t always the romantics: One study found that men experience love at first sight more often than women. Researchers think that’s because men respond to physical cues [肢体信号] more readily than women, and women tend to develop trust more gradually than men.

> But it’s unclear how often love at first sight turns into a successful partnership.Sometimes one look is all it takes to fall in love [只需要一瞬间]. But some experts think real affection develops gradually over time.

# III.Ways to ask if someone has a boyfriend or girlfriend
> Even if you are a nosy [爱管闲事] relative, it can still come across as awkward or even a little rude to ask someone if they have a boyfriend or girlfriend directly. That's why in today's dialogue we see Lulu's relatives using different expressions to try to find out if she is dating someone.

- Tell us about your love life.

- Are you seeing anyone? 

- Is there anyone special in your life? 

> You don't necessarily need to memorize these questions word for word. Inquiries about a person's love life will often use elements from these questions, but might end up taking a different form. A person could ask "Are you seeing anyone special?" or "do you have a special someone?", for example. You could also ask "are you involved" with anyone, but the word "involved" often has the connotation /ˌkɑnə'teʃən/ [n.内涵；含蓄] of being connected to some kind of criminal activity. "How's your love life" is pretty direct, but it's still better than "Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend?" because at least it gives the person an opportunity to say something other than "yes" or "no".

> There is another sneaky [adj.狡猾的] tactic that is often used by both nosy relatives and regular people (both men and women) looking for dates. Just assume that the person does have a significant other [先假定有另一半], and then ask something about that supposed relationship. For example, you could ask "what did your boyfriend get you for Valentine's Day/your birthday/Christmas". If the person is seeing someone, then they can tell you about the gift and, indirectly, their boyfriend. If they aren't seeing anyone or don't want to tell you, then this gives them the opportunity to answer in the way they so choose.

# IV.grammar
# 1.At first & love at first sight/ bite/fight & at first glance/ blush
> 1)most of the time “at first” doesn’t imply something continuing in this way. Rather, it means that in the beginning, the situation was one way (or seemed to be one way), but then at some point it changed.

> 2)“Love at first sight” has a very specific meaning: from the moment one person sees another person, they fall in love with them and, importantly, continue to love them over time. At first is a tiny phrase that can either be used on its own or found in other phrases such as “love at first sight”.

> 3)Of course, we also played around a bit with the phrase “love at first sight” in our dialogue, giving the phrase “love at first bite”. You could really put any word in place of “sight” and it will be understood as something that continues. For example, if a man fell in love with a woman who was a professional fighter, he could say that it was “love at first fight”.

> 4)We see this in other phrases containing “at first” as well: “at first glance” and “at first blush” both imply that something seemed one way in the beginning, but didn’t or couldn’t continue.

- 1. At first I thought he was a genius, but over time I realized he was a madman.

- 2. The plan looks good at first glance, but when you really look into it, you can see its flaws.

- 3. When Thomas Edison produced the first commercial light bulb, it was love at first light!

# 2.left behind [n.剩女; 留下; 遗留] & to be /get left over
> 1)Chinese culture does have the concept of "women who are left behind", and it's not exactly positive.

> 2) "left behind" comes from the phrase "to leave behind". When you "leave something behind", it means to go somewhere and not bring a certain thing with you. It could be something serious like leaving behind family members, or something less serious like forgetting your keys at home.

> 3)"Leave behind" can also mean "increase the distance" by which one is ahead of someone or something else. We see this a lot when we talk about the economy: Some people succeed, and others get left behind.

> 4)You will likely not encounter the phrase "to leave over" in its infinitive or present form. it is often seen in the passive form "be left over/get left over". In this case, it means that something was not used or consumed, as in "there was a lot of wine left over from the party". Probably the most common way that you will see this word though is as an adjective, "leftover", which would allow you to say the phrase above as "there was a lot of leftover wine after the party".

- 1. My favorite part of Thanksgiving is all the leftover turkey!

- 2. Our new education policies will ensure that no student gets left behind!

- 3. Grandpa always tells us the story of how he was almost left behind during the war.

- 4. These refugees /'rɛfjʊdʒi/ [n.避难者;难民] had to leave everything behind in order to find safety and freedom.

# 3.set sb up on/go on a blind date [phr.安排和别人约会] & set sb up with a job/friends
> 1)So a blind date is just a date with someone that you haven't met before or you haven't spoken to before.It doesn't really mean that the date is blind, that she or he cannot see anything. We often use blind like if the sun is really bright and it's shining in your eyes, we say "Oh, the sun was blinding. I can't see."But a blind date is different from online dating, Because with online dating, you usually talk to the person before.And you can at least see a picture.

> 2)to set sb up,this means to arrange a meeting,so usually we say "go on a date" or "set someone up on a date."You can set someone up with, but that is used in different situations.I could set you up with my friend.Or you can set somebody up with a job.So "with" can be used for people or jobs, but we use "on" with the word "date."

# 4.picky [adj.挑剔的] & I have a type [phr.有自己喜欢的类型]
> 1)So if you're picky, there's like a lot of people or a lot of things you just don't like. For example, I could say he's picky about food. He doesn't eat seafood and vegetable.maybe like, when I go shopping for clothes, I'm a little picky, cause some clothes just don't look good on me.

> 2)So if you say "I have a type," it means there is a specific kind of person that you like. I mean you could say "Oh, she's totally his type" or "He's totally her type."

# 5.easygoing [adj.随和的]
> when someone's easygoing, they don't get mad easily. They don't get stressed out easily.If you're someone that always says, "Don't worry about it, and it's okay. No problem." then maybe you're easygoing.But we only use easygoing for people.We can't use it for things like I can't say "I went on an easygoing date."It's really just for personalities exactly.

# 6.a sense of sth sight / smell /taste /direction
> 1)Sense.It really just means feeling or in this case ability almost,ike ability to understand,and we often use this phrase "a sense of something." Like, we all have a sense of sight or smell or taste. 

> 2)But it could also be humor is like an ability, so it could be a sense of direction.So if you have no sense of direction, it means you can't understand directions and you often get lost. If you get lost a lot, maybe you don't have a good sense of direction, maybe you need your smartphone.

# 7.on paper [phr.理论上]
> 1)"on paper," it means in theory or the idea. It should be fine but maybe it's not.When you actually do something, it doesn't always work out the way you thought, or the way it was on paper.you can also think about your dating profiles.And maybe when you look at their profile, hey, it looks like we're going to be a good match, we are a good match on paper. But when you actually meet the person, it's not the same.

> 2)If you're talking about a job interview,I might say he looks good on paper but we'll see how he does in the job interview. So when I say he looks good on paper, I mean his resume looks good.maybe he has a great resume, but he's really awkward and he is not very good with people.

# 8.you guys would really click [v.合得来] & we have chemistry
> 1)Click" is a word we use a lot. It means get along well.especially with romantic couples,It could be a friend maybe, like "My friend and I didn't click,"  But maybe if you meet someone at the bar, you might just click.

> 2)There's another phrase we use, that is "We have chemistry."So that one is like more often used for romantic relationships.

# 9.commit to goals/job [v.承诺] & commitment [n.]
> 1)So here she's talking about committing to a relationship, and that means to promise to be with that person."Commit" really just means promise. When you do something that's hard to do, like, losing weight or staying healthy and eating, it's hard to commit to those goals.It's hard to promise to do them and continue to do them. Now you can also commit to a job, and that is when you promise to stay with this job, like maybe for a long time and work hard.

> 2)the noun of this word "commit" is "commitment." For example, getting a dog or a pet is a big commitment.Or getting married is a big commitment.

# 10.to give/have a shot [phr.试试看]
> 1)to "give it a shot," this just means to try it.I think of like sports, like, he shoots, he scores or maybe he didn't score. When you shoot, when you give it a shot, you're just trying.So you might try to shoot in that sense.

> 2)You can sometimes say "have a shot," like "I had a shot at it but it didn't work."

# 11.seeing [v.交往]
> 1)This word here "seeing," it's another way to say "dating,"Usually in the early part of the relationship before it gets really serious.and we usually use this in the progressive, like "Have you been seeing anyone?" "Are you seeing anyone?"We don't say "Do you see anyone?"

> 2)So this word "seeing" goes really well with "lately" or "recently," seeing anyone lately, seeing anyone recently.And you can use this in a question too, Like, "How long has she been seeing him?"she's been seeing him for a couple weeks.

# 12.scene [n.景色、场合] & dating scene [n.约会场合]
> 1)Now the word "scene," you might have seen in the phrase "movie scene."There are lots of scenes there. Like you said a part of a movie, it could be a view like a gorgeous scene on the mountain.

> 2)But when we're talking about the dating scene, this is the situation where you are looking around for a date.It just means situation. this is what you're doing these days. Or I personally don't really go to clubs very much because clubs are not really my scene.

> 3)maybe if you just broke up with someone, you might want to get back into the dating scene.

***In that case, I've got a single friend I think you'd like.***

***Oh, so you want to set me up on a blind date, do you?***

***Yep, you deserve someone special! I can show you a picture of her if it helps. She's really cute.***

***Okay, sure, but what's she like? I'm not picky but I do have a type.***

***She's super easygoing and has a great sense of humor.***

***That does sound like my type, but Lindsay and I were good on paper and it still didn't work out.***

***Alright, I'll give it a shot.***

***Great, I'll let her know!***

# V.pattern
***Do you believe in love at first sight, Jen?***

***Personally, I’ve always thought the idea was a bit far-fetched.***

***Really? You’ve never experienced it? What about with your husband?***

***We hit it off, sure. But there was no spark. He just grew on me over time.***

***Not with my wife and me. When I first saw her, there was an instant attraction. I knew right away that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.***

***It could be because of outcome bias, meaning that because you guys are in a healthy long-term relationship now, you believe that it was great from the get-go.***

***Well, if that’s the case, then you should feel the same way, right?***

***I’m not sure. I actually read a study that said men reported they experienced love at first sight more than women.***

***I wonder if that includes your husband.***

***If you ask him, he’ll tell you that he fell in love with me after the first time I cooked for him.***

***Oh, so I guess you could say it was "love at first bite"!***

# V.pattern
***Lulu! Tell us about your love life. Are you seeing anyone?***

***I’m not looking to get married any time soon, Auntie.***

***But the clock is ticking! You don’t want to get left behind!***

***Oh ease up on her, darling. A girl as beautiful as Lulu won’t have any problems finding a match.***

***You know, Old Wang next door has a nephew who’s single. I heard he just bought a house in the city. Maybe we can set you two up.***

***I’m not interested in blind dates, Auntie.***

***Who said anything about a blind date? We’ll all just get together for a chat and see where it goes from there. I’ll just go grab his phone number!***

***Lulu, I know she can be a little much, but she only wants what’s best for you.***

***I understand that, Uncle. I just wish she could be a bit less narrow-minded.***

***Well now that she’s gone, you can tell your old uncle. Is there anyone special in your life?***

***Sorry, sorry! It’s just the way our generation is wired. We didn’t have the opportunities you kids have today. We had to be more practical.***

***Do you think what I’m doing isn’t practical too, Uncle?***

***Sorry, that came out wrong. Personally, I think it’s great what you’re doing. As long as you follow your heart, your old uncle will always have your back.***

***Thanks a million, Uncle!***
