# Dinner with clients

# I.Business Dinner in China
> It is widely believed that Chinese cuisine /kwɪˈzin/ [n.烹饪艺术] is one of the world’s most sophisticated. This should come as no surprise, considering how much Chinese people enjoy food-related activities. Going out for big lunches and dinners is the nation’s pastime /'pæstaɪm/ [n.消遣,娱乐] .

> The country has an endless parade of dishes to call its own[有丰富多样的菜肴]. The variety across regions is astounding /ə'staʊndɪŋ/ [adj.使人震惊的] . Most times, even the same dish can differ dramatically from place to place.

> Restaurants are generally big, multifloor [多层] buildings that are more akin to [phr.类似] a banquet /'bæŋkwɪt/ [n.宴会,盛宴] hall. They are often extravagant, with private rooms and a large wait staff that fawns over [应对] guests’ needs. Menus come adorned /ə'dɔrn/ [vt.装饰] with well designed hard covers and pages of pictured scrumptious /'skrʌmpʃəs/ [adj. <口>可口的,美味的] dishes.

> There is no such a thing as ordering for yourself. The Chinese like to share their meals. They order several dishes, usually a table full of them, and then each dish is circulated for everyone to sample until it’s gone.[菜会随着圆盘转动，大家都可以吃]

> Remember, don’t start eating before your hosts[不要提前开始吃]. They may take that as disrespect or disapproval. Also, the Chinese culture is very hierarchical. This is reflected at the table where seniors and higher status people get first dibs /dɪbz/ [n.权利] on main dishes.[长辈或较高地位的人先动筷子]

> Don’t expect a glass of ice-cold water to be automatically served with the food. The Chinese don’t like drinking cold water. Instead they enjoy hot tea with their lunches and dinners. The tea is served at the beginning of meals. If you want water, you have to order it separately.

> You may want to choose a mild alcohol [选度数不太高的酒] when ordering drinks because you will not be drinking at your own pace[喝酒的节奏不是你自己能掌握的]. Every time someone raises their glass to you, you have to drink and you have to drink an entire glassful of whatever you ordered. And they will keep on refilling your glass for seemingly endless toasts.

> Business may or may not be discussed during the meal. Feel free to delve into [陶醉] the subject if it comes up. If it doesn’t, don’t worry; that is also normal.

# II.Topics to talk about at a business dinner
# 1.Research
> Perhaps the best way to ensure that the business conversation doesn't die an ugly death [不会陷入一片死寂] is to prepare yourself for the engagement by performing a little research [做些小调查]. Understanding who your fellow diners are and what they're interested in can help prevent awkward silences and inappropriate topics.

# 2.Prelude /'prɛljud/  [话题引入]
> Start things off with a intriguing comment or line of questioning that gets people talking and interacting. Try something completely unrelated to the business at hand so your guests are caught off guard but can't help but join in.[放下防备，情不自禁地加入谈话]

# 3.Hosting [主导节奏]
> If the meal is informal, dive into [直入] your business topics once you've placed the order for the table. If you have arranged a longer, more formal meal, consider waiting until the main course is served to go make the switch from casual conversation to a business discussion.

# III.grammar 
# 1.the whole...thing
> The phrase the whole...thing is a colloquial /kə'lokwɪəl/ [口语化] pattern used as a polite way to refer to a broader idea, activity, or concept. It’s often used to refer to new trends.

> 2)You can say "I could see myself doing whatever", so it could be anything you think will happen to you in the future.So he says "I could see myself living here." You know, you could also say something like "I could see myself living by the beach one day" or "I don't think I could see myself working in that environment." We can also use this phrase for things that you don't want to do or you don't like.or you don’t think are going to happen.

# 3.establishment [n.场所、公司]
> An establishment can be any business or organization even an institution, such as, you know, the church. it could be a lot of, a lot of different places, so here they are at a restaurant.
