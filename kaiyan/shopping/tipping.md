# Tipping headache
# I.North America’s tipping culture is becoming increasingly oppressive and costly.
> According to a Vice article by Vanmala Subramaniam, North American tipping practices have become increasingly oppressive /ə'prɛsɪv/ [adv.沉重地]. Merely a decade ago, 10 percent was considered an acceptable gratuity /ɡrə'tuəti/ [n.小费] and 15 percent was given for impeccable /ɪm'pɛkəbl/ [n.完美无缺的] service. Today, those numbers have risen by 5 percent, making 15 percent the new standard of acceptability /ək,septə'biləti/[n.可接受性].

> Additionally /ə'dɪʃənli/ [adv.加之,又], the pressure to tip in the modern age[现代] appears to stem /stɛm/ [vt.遏制] more strongly from cultural obligation[文化义务] rather than the expectation of good service. Many feel the need to match the tips of their dining partners and feel ashamed by the thought of not tipping enough. There is also a general belief that customers should help supplement /'sʌplɪmənt/ [vt.增补] the low wages of servers. However, tipping can create wage disparity /dɪ'spærəti/ [n.不一致] between servers and kitchen workers as servers typically take home the bulk of[大部分的] the tip.

> Ironically, despite originating in the U.K., tipping in Britain has become rare with gratuity expectations falling far below North America’s. The change in perspective was brought about by[这种观点的改变是由于] a minimum wage[最低工资] increase which eliminated /ɪ'lɪmɪnet/ [vt.消除] the need for customers to supplement employee wages. Although many have demanded that a similar custom should be adopted in North America, it remains to be seen whether any changes will be made in the near future.

I don't get a lot of real headaches, but you know, in...in our lives, in our daily lives, we do encounter many things that they kind of give us headaches.Yeah, like stressful things. You got a lot of stress and maybe that really gives you a headache.

> 3)pian in the butt & pain in the neck: So just something that causes you pain or makes you hurt. keep that in mind that we don't...we don't say, you know, "I am ache in the neck". It's a headache or a pain in the neck, pain in the butt or just pain.

# 2.delectable /dɪ'lɛktəbl/ [adj. 令人愉快的；美味的]
> 1)And this is actually a pretty cool word, but we don't usually say it.If you say "it looks good" "it looks good" "it looks good" every time, it's kind of boring. So, it's sort of like, almost like a joke, right?It could be. 

> 2)Because "delectable" is...is supposed to be "delicious", but also like it's...it's a certain kind of foods, it's probably very expensive.Fancy. So, usually I would say this word when I'm eating something that is not expensive or not very fancy.

# 3.gratuity  /ɡrə'tuəti/ 
> Gratuity" is just a fancy word for tip.Exactly right. So if you get your bill, and you...you sometimes will see that word "gratuity" on...on the bill, and that just means tip.Yes, It's kind of an uncountable noun.

# 4.sit-down [adj.堂食]
> Yeah. So as it looks here, it's a restaurant where you sit down at a table.Right. Now, Mcdonalds has tables. Is it a sit-down restaurant?Honestly, I wouldn't call it a sit-down restaurant, because there's no table service.Right. That's the key.

# 5.juding by [phr.根据] & considering & evaluating & calculate
> Movies trying to calculate how much it would be, right?

# 6.I'd say
> Sure, exactly. Now, "I'd say" here is just a way of expressing your opinion, "well, I'd say, you know, eighteen percent".It's kind of like giving your opinion when nobody asked, like "if you asked me, I would say..."Right, and that's why we have the, well, because no "would" in this. But we have the "I", "I would say", it's a bit more polite, because, yeah, "I am" sort of "I'm just expressing my opinion", maybe nobody asked. But then it's cool how they also combine this phrase "I'd say" with that first phrase "judging by".Yeah. You can often use it like that judging by blah blah blah. "I'd say" and then give your suggestion.Sure. So I could look at...maybe I saw Connor looked a little...looked a little sad. I'd say, "Judging by his facial expressions, I'd say...I'd say he needs some cheering up."

# 7.make a killing [phr.赚大钱] & make
> “Make” is used in a variety of money expressions, usually in order to mean “earn.” However, although some of these expressions can be used with the verb “earn” many of them are set expressions that can only be used with “make.”

> 1)“To make a killing” is one money expression that means to earn a huge profit[巨额利润]. It is frequently used to someone makes a lot of money (very quickly) like in the stock market.

> 2)“To make a living” on the other hand is used to express that someone earns the money they need to survive[谋生]. “Making a living” therefore refers to the money you will use to pay for rent and food. Here, it is possible to replace “make” with the word “earn.”[可以用“earn”一词来代替“make”]Yeah, I mean you can make a decent living,you can make a comfortable living.But it's not...you're not emphasizing how difficult it is, you're just saying, you know, we all have to do what we have to do.

> 3)”To make ends meet” means that you are surviving financially [财务上能够活下去]and are able to pay your bills. Although the expression is similar to "make a living," "to make ends meet" has a stronger sense of financial difficulty.

How does one make ends meet?It's kind of using a negative sense, right? Like usually when it's...when it difficult. Yeah. It's like "oh! I can't make ends meet or I'm struggling to make ends meet."Right. Or why does Bill Gates have so much money when so many people are struggling to make ends meet?

# 9.proportion.
> Ok. "Proportion" means a part.Yeah, like a percentage of how much money they make.Yeah, for sure, but of course, you know, these tips they're making up a larger and larger percentage or larger and larger proportion of their income. And a lot of these people, you know, they're not really struggling to make ends meet.

# 17.everything from sth to sth & everything form A to Z 
> 1)it is used to express a wide range[表达范围很宽].

- 1. They've got everything from apples to zucchinis /zuˈkini/ [西葫芦]

# 18.(it's a) long story [n.说来话长]
