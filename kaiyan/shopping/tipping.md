# Tipping headache
# I.North America’s tipping culture is becoming increasingly oppressive and costly.
> According to a Vice article by Vanmala Subramaniam, North American tipping practices have become increasingly oppressive /ə'prɛsɪv/ [adv.沉重地]. Merely a decade ago, 10 percent was considered an acceptable gratuity /ɡrə'tuəti/ [n.小费] and 15 percent was given for impeccable /ɪm'pɛkəbl/ [n.完美无缺的] service. Today, those numbers have risen by 5 percent, making 15 percent the new standard of acceptability /ək,septə'biləti/[n.可接受性].

> Additionally /ə'dɪʃənli/ [adv.加之,又], the pressure to tip in the modern age[现代] appears to stem /stɛm/ [vt.遏制] more strongly from cultural obligation[文化义务] rather than the expectation of good service. Many feel the need to match the tips of their dining partners and feel ashamed by the thought of not tipping enough. There is also a general belief that customers should help supplement /'sʌplɪmənt/ [vt.增补] the low wages of servers. However, tipping can create wage disparity /dɪ'spærəti/ [n.不一致] between servers and kitchen workers as servers typically take home the bulk of[大部分的] the tip.

> Ironically, despite originating in the U.K., tipping in Britain has become rare with gratuity expectations falling far below North America’s. The change in perspective was brought about by[这种观点的改变是由于] a minimum wage[最低工资] increase which eliminated /ɪ'lɪmɪnet/ [vt.消除] the need for customers to supplement employee wages. Although many have demanded that a similar custom should be adopted in North America, it remains to be seen whether any changes will be made in the near future.

I don't get a lot of real headaches, but you know, in...in our lives, in our daily lives, we do encounter many things that they kind of give us headaches.Yeah, like stressful things. You got a lot of stress and maybe that really gives you a headache.

> 3)pian in the butt & pain in the neck: So just something that causes you pain or makes you hurt. keep that in mind that we don't...we don't say, you know, "I am ache in the neck". It's a headache or a pain in the neck, pain in the butt or just pain.

# 2.delectable /dɪ'lɛktəbl/ [adj. 令人愉快的；美味的]
> 1)And this is actually a pretty cool word, but we don't usually say it.If you say "it looks good" "it looks good" "it looks good" every time, it's kind of boring. So, it's sort of like, almost like a joke, right?It could be. 

> 2)Because "delectable" is...is supposed to be "delicious", but also like it's...it's a certain kind of foods, it's probably very expensive.Fancy. So, usually I would say this word when I'm eating something that is not expensive or not very fancy.

> Gratuity" is just a fancy word for tip.Exactly right. So if you get your bill, and you...you sometimes will see that word "gratuity" on...on the bill, and that just means tip.Yes, It's kind of an uncountable noun.

# 4.sit-down [adj.堂食]

# III.pattern
***Acceptable gratuity at sit-down restaurants has increased a lot.so now it's basically fifteen to twenty percent.***

***Not just the meal,but the experience in general.Juding by your meal and the good service,I'd say eighteen percent would be good.***

***That's such a big chunk of the menu price.Servers must make a killing on tips.***
