# 2.tax free & duty free & VAT-free/ value added free [免征增值税] & tax refund [n.退税] & reimburse [v.报销、返现]
> 1) So a tax, they're talking about, just the tax on the goods.Yeah, it's like, when you buy anything basically, they give you your tax back.

> 2) Duty free stores are usually in the airport, and it's just when you bring stuff back to your country, you have to pay, like a tax on it. It's for... It's a tax for bringing things into a country. But this is just a regular tax.

> 3)But, it looks like their tax has a specific name.So this is called "VAT". It's spelled V-A-T. So, in this case, it's "VAT-free".and that's just stands for "value added tax". Sometimes you'll hear VAT or V A T, or sometimes people will just say the entire thing, value added tax. And sometimes you'll hear the whole thing.

> 4)But here in Canada and in America, we pay taxes on our income, and at the end of the year, or actually, sorry, the next year, we get a tax refund.cause if you've paid too much taxes, the governments said, "Here, well, have a little back."

> 5) "reimburse". because it means that you get your money back. So it's kind of like a refund, But it's not exactly the same. So you will normally hear reimburse when you're talking about a business trip. So sometimes you have to pay for that plane ticket out of pocket, or maybe you need to pay for your dinner out of pocket. Now, after you pay, you'll get an invoice and you take it back to your company. And they will then reimburse you. That's why you got to save your receipts,for everything.

# 3.eligible [adj.合格的、符合资格的]
> This is a word we use a lot, because some things that you buy, you can't get a tax refund on, like food.normally has to be over a certain price. And that price is the requirement that you have to meet to be eligible.That's right. Like you can't vote, you're not eligible to vote until you're eighteen years old in Canada. Oh, nineteen actually.You could also apply for a university and you know they will check if you are eligible for acceptance.

# 4.paperwork [n.表格、单子] & hoops to jump through [phr.]
> 1)So paperwork is a lot like forms actually, those are the documents, those papers you need to...to fill out, to...to complete when you apply for a job, apply for a visa, or you know, insurance, or something like that.Sometimes people will actually ask you, too. Do you have your paper work?and it's usually more than one piece of paper, just basically it's the documents with your information.

> 2) "to jump through hoops". It's when you have to do a lot of really annoying and unnecessary things to...to complete or achieve something,and just as you can imagine, jumping through hoops, literally would not be that fun.A common example is like applying for a visa, finally, getting the visa, you have to do a lot of annoying steps, and you can say, "Oh, man. There's so many hoops to jump through to get a visa."so you might say, "You know what? There is too many hoops. I'm just not gonna do it."

# 5.service fee [phr.服务费] 
> Service fee is not a tip.it's basically a charge for the service, and it is included in the bill.So, for example, if you sign up for a new internet service in your house, somebody will come and install it, and then, there is a service fee.but even with the service fee, it's worth it.If you're gonna buy a lot of clothes, you're gonna save a lot of money with that tax refund.

# 6.customs officer [phr.海关官员]
> So customs officer, you've probably seen this person very frequently. This is the person at the airport that checks to make sure that you aren't bringing anything in, that is illegal. So basically when you go to a country, the person there asks you why are you here. When you come back to your country, someone will say what did you buy. That's the customs officer.and just be careful that it's not "custom", it's "customs officer". custom is a tradition. But it's funny we say this word always "customs", "customs", always with an "s".and that would prefer to like the goods and services.The imports and exports.

# III.pattern
***Hey, Cindy. I’m going to Europe next week and was wondering about shopping tax free.***

***Oh, it’s so easy! Just look for the VAT-free logo and you can get a tax refund on eligible purchases.***

***So where do I get the forms for that?***

***Just show your passport to the cashier and they’ll give you the paperwork and an invoice for the refund.***

***Then where do I take that?***

***Sometimes they’ll reimburse you in the store, but often you have to take it to a third party like Global Blue. You can even mail in the forms.***

***Oh, and do they charge a service fee?***

***Yep, but it’s still worth it. Then the customs officer will stamp your documents at the airport before you come back.***

***Sounds like some annoying hoops to jump through.***

***Yeah, but it’ll save you money in the long run!***
