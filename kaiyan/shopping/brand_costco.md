# I.Costco's business model
> Costco's business model is making it unstoppable [势不可挡], even in an uncertain [前途未卜] retail industry.Costco "operates one of the best business models in our space,[运营的商业模式是最佳模式]" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. According to analysts, the retail giant [零售巨头] succeeds by only minimally marking up offerings [加价幅度最低], passing along lower costs to customers, and providing "differentiated and high quality [多样化高质量]" products.

> Costco has become the go-to destination [首选目的地] for a wide variety of products that consumers prefer to buy in-person [亲身前往], as opposed to online [而非在线购买的], including cars, gasoline, and groceries. By becoming one of the best-value option [首选] for items that shoppers want to purchase at brick-and-mortar [实体店] locations, the company has been able to continue to compete against swiftly-growing e-commerce [快速增长] companies, such as Amazon.

> The other aspect of Costco's business that has helped it compete against retail rivals [对手抗衡] is its membership model [会员模式]. The "underlying health and loyalty of Costco's consumer [消费者的运转] and the profitability /ˌprɑfɪtəˈbɪlətɪ/ [n. 获利(状况)，盈利(情况)] of the model remain intact," states Morgan Stanley analysis. The membership model is currently one of the hottest trends in retail. Costco's members make up 44.6 million [4460万] households, accounting for $785 million [7.85亿美元] in sales in the fourth quarter.

# II.grammar
# 1.现在分词动词+ing
> The present participle VERB+ing can be used to start a phrase or clause that gives a reason for a person's feelings, opinions or actions. In this usage, the participle replaces conjunctions "like," "because," "since" or "as."

> For instance, in this lesson "Considering how cheap their house brand merchandise is, I'm not surprised." However, she could have said, "Because their house brand merchandise is so cheap, I'm not surprised."Note that the participles considering, seeing, thinking and being are most often used when giving reasons this way

- 1. Being new, he wasn't quite sure what he should do.

- 2. Considering that it will be pretty cold at night, I suggest you take a coat.

- 3. Seeing how he isn't very supportive of the idea, I'm not sure we'll get his vote.

# 2.merchandise_related
## 1)wholesale [n.批发] 
> So as you can imagine wholesale prices are those kind of cheaper prices. Now before we talk more about that, maybe we should talk about what a wholesaler is. a wholesaler is a company that sells things to stores, and they usually sell things in large amounts for cheap prices.

## 2)retailer [n.零售]
> So a wholesaler would generally sell to a retailer，individual people, like you or me, might go to the retailer and pay way way too much.

## 3)in bulk [phr.大量、批发]
> "In bulk" is when you buy things in large amounts. when you go to Costco, it's always like, buy a box of, you know, twenty or something like that.buy fifteen cans of tuna fish.One big pack or something like that. a lot of the other products that they have, they sell in only large quantities, especially the food items I feel like.There are some things I will say that you don't have to buy in bulk at Costco like a TV, for example.

- 1. My mother always buys canned food in bulk.

- 2. Wow, it looks like you've really been bulking up at the gym.

- 3. The bulk of the traffic had passed.

## 4)house brand merchandise /'mɝtʃəndaɪs/ [n.自有品牌]
> the house brand is the brand that the company makes. This is the brand that Costco makes. But it isn't called the Costco Brand. that's called Kirkland that's like their house brand that only Costco carries. So therefore it's called their house brand. 

## 5) no-name brand & store brand
> We also have some other terms that are similar, like no-name brand, and also store brand. House brand here's a little different, because it doesn't say Costco on the product. Instead, it says the name of the brand that they only carry: Kirkland.And it's quite cheap,the quality is good, too. I'm usually pretty satisfied whenever I buy some Kirkland stuff, to be honest.

# 3.manage_related
## 1)make/rake/take money hand over fist [phr.迅速大量的]
> "Hand over fist" here, it basically means to make a lot of money and to make it quickly. we usually just use this saying to talk about making money.It just means to make money really quickly. So we say "make money hand over fist," "rake in money hand over fist" or I mean, you could "take money hand over fist" too.

## 2)profit margins [n.利润率] 
> the profit margins. This basically is how much a company makes after you deduct all the costs.
 
## 3)earnings [n.利润]
> So earnings is just the money that they make.Earnings is the money that you get through working or doing something. Basically you deserve it.So Costco actually spends no money on marketing, as far as I know. I don't think they even have a PR, a public relations department. So that's, that's really surprising for such a big and successful company. But membership fees actually are their primary source of earnings.

## 4)lean operation [n.精益经营] 
> a lean operation is just when you minimize the cost to really maximize your revenue.So when something is lean, there's not a lot of fat; there's not a lot of extra stuff.So we often say cut the fat, get rid of things you don't need, so you can work or do something more efficiently. So basically Costco runs an operation that's not very fatty. it's a very efficient operation. "operation" here. It's just like a way of doing things, It's like a system, so you could be talking about a business operation, or like a military operation.

## 5)overhead costs [n.日常管理成本]
> So overhead costs. This is just the cost out side of labor. It's the cost of things that are not related to manufacturing. so money may be spent on marketing, for example.

## 6)customer base [n.客户群]
> So your customer base is the group of customers that repeatedly buy your products and repeatedly use your services.

## 7)customer retention [n.客户维持]
> retention. This comes from the verb to retain. To retain means to keep something or someone. So customer retention just means keeping your customers.So it's not just customers you can retain. If a company keeps its employees for a long time, you know, you could say they have high employee retention.

## 8)warehouse club [n.仓储会员店]
>  So a warehouse here, it's like a big place, almost looks kind of like a factory. It's not fancy. It's like big and open, and very basic. It's very simple. So if you've ever gone to a Costco, and you step inside was basically a warehouse.A lot of other stores will put money into decorating and looking nice, while Costco is very bare bones. It doesn't look special at all. And it's a warehouse club because you had to be a member to go and shop at Costco. You have to pay a membership fee every year.those yearly fees, and that's how they get their money.

# 4.merge
> 1)So to merge means to join, to come together. So companies can merge, people, like we can merge ideas, too. Or roads can merge, too. Especially like on a highway or anything like that.

> 2)So basically Costco first opened in the nineteen seventies. It was opened by a man named Sol Price and his son. But the warehouse club retail model later caught on and spawned their rival, Costco, with whom Price Club then merged with in 1993. So basically the original Price Club had to then merge with today's big conglomerate Costco. So basically they merged. And as we say, if you can't beat them, join them.

- 1. If those two companies merge, it will be a monopoly.

- 2. The traffic failed to merge and caused gridlock.

- 3. Individuality and uniqueness are merged and blurred.

# 5.spawned /spɔn/ [v.催生] & to give birth 
> 1)spawned. Their warehouse retail model later caught on and spawned their rival Costco. So "to spawn" something means "to give birth."to give birth to something. But a lot of times it sounds kinda negative, too. Like it depends on what you're talking about. Some things that sound good; other things that sounds kind of bad. Like if I had kids, I wouldn't call them my spawn. They sound like they're children of the devil. You can't say that. just don't use it for your children.

> 2) But you can spawn things like, an industry. The fitness craze spawned a multimillion dollar industry. So for things like business, or maybe like you could spawn an idea. That might be good as well. You can use it when talking about animal still. I like this example: the sea turtle spawned by the beach every spring. like if they have eggs or something like this. Like fish, sure, and turtles, you can use spawn.

- 1. The fitness craze spawned a multimillion dollar industry.

- 2. The sea turtles spawn by the beach every spring.

- 3. The dismal market spawned a wave of layoffs.
