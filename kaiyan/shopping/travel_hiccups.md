***Chloe, you look well rested! How was your trip to Zhangjiajie?***

***Oh, the fresh mountain air and clean water will do wonders for your spirit.***

***So everything went according to plan? ***

***Oh, not at all. There were a few hiccups along the way. The trip started off with lost luggage, and to add insult to injury, all my clothes were packed in my checked bags.***

***Seriously? How inconvenient!***

***Yeah! Luckily I wore several layers, packed the most essential toiletries in travel-sized bottles, and brought all my electronics with me.***

***I always pack a few changes of clothing in my carry-on. You never know when you might need to live out of your suitcase.***

***If you want to save space, you can roll your clothes and use smaller items like socks to stuff into the nooks and crannies.***

***How do you deal with toiletries? I'm always so paranoid about leakages.***

***Well, I use tape to seal the lids or caps, and I pour liquids into vacuum pump bottles for extra security.***

***Wow, you’re such a packing guru!***
