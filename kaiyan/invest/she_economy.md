# III.pattern
***Ellen, as an expert in the "She economy," can you start by explaining the term?***

***It refers to the female-driven economy. Women are driving growth in sectors such as e-commerce, healthcare and financial services. In China, women account for 41% of the GDP.***

***That's substantial. What's fueling this trend?***

***Well, rising female empowerment and employment have certainly increased spending power, particularly for single working women.***

***Does it mean that women have more clout in society? Are they pressing companies to tap into the female perspective?***

***Certainly. However, despite growing economic power, women are still underrepresented and underappreciated in fields such as science and the C-suite.***

***So, that is to say, economic gains haven't exactly translated to wider employment gains for women?***

***Well, we have achieved a lot. But more still needs to be done to level the playing field.***

***Ok, do you have any concrete suggestions? Who should we be putting the onus on?***

***It requires concerted efforts from families, corporations and society as a whole.***
