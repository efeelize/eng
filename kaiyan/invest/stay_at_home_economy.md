# I.Out with the old,in with the new:the stay-at-home economy might be here to stay
> The COVID-19 pandemic has ignited an explosion of the stay-at-home economy. Many countries are imposing strict lockdown measures to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, which ultimately has led to a rapid transformation to working from home.

> The Internet has long empowered consumers with a more efficient path to the products and services they need to consume in their everyday lives. Noticeably, the disruption of the traditional shopping model reduced the time consumers spend traveling to and from traditional "brick-and-mortar" stores. Of course, now the pandemic has forced them to do even more shopping online. 

> Besides, the Internet has enabled some businesses and governments to do well in the new "working at home" environment. And the adoption of video streaming services allows students to continue to study at home. The demand for home entertainment, such as video games, live broadcasting, and online movies, has also increased. 

> Online activity is grabbing the lion's share of all commerce and human activity at the moment. Will those traditional jobs return or is this a shocking new paradigm brought on by a pandemic? We don't know, but staying in is the new going out for now. 

# II.grammar
# 1.insofar as sth ... is concerned
> It means to the extent or degree that something is concerned.
It's similar to "regarding" and is often used to limit a topic. For instance, "Insofar as the projects for this month are concerned, the deadlines need to be changed." Here "insofar as" limits the next statement to the projects for this month.

> "Insofar as" can also be used to clarify the topic in a question. For example, in today's lesson, Noah asked,"You mean insofar as services like at-home workouts and shopping are concerned?" Here it was used to clarify Jen's belief that would never go back to the old model of primarily at-home workouts and in-store shopping.
