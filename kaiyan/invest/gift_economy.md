# Gift_economy
# I.tips for picking gifts
# 1.give problem-solves
> When it comes to how to pick gifts, find a problem in your recipient's life and solve it with your generosity. For examples: Get their knives sharpened, buy them black-out blinds, or pay for a handyman to go to their house and fix up the little things like squeaky doors, broken light switches, and leaking sinks.

# 2. don't give them more problems
> People don't like having to make decisions, so don't pick a gift that makes them decide. When you buy someone a gift card, you're giving them a problem by passing the decision-making burden to them. For example, if you gift a massage or cooking lessons, schedule it, too. So they don't have to decide.

# 3.be practical,not flashy
> Our choices in gifts tend to be selfish. We want the glory of being great gift-givers, so we buy presents with a maximum bedazzlement factor. Flashy flowers, for example.

# 4.put the "present" in presentation
> Write a thoughtful letter full of sentiments. Disguise a small gift in a giant package, make it a scavenger hunt, or wrap a gag gift and reveal the real one afterward.

# II.grammar
# 1.just because...doesn't mean ...
> This is a pretty useful pattern for when you are debating with people. Patrick argues that the gift economy is a way for big businesses to make money. Rob's counterpoint is that while that may be true, the consequences
of that do not mean that he cannot still feel joy in giving.

> We're not limited to the word "preclude" in this pattern. A more common pattern is: Just because A doesn't mean B. This means that although A may be true, it doesn't follow that B is also true. We can use other words
that are synonymous with mean, such as "imply" or "indicate."

- 1. Just because she smiled at you doesn't mean she has a crush on you![仅仅因为她对你笑了并不代表她喜欢你！]

- 2. Just because certain people have disabilities doesn't imply that they can't work.[仅仅因为有些人身体残疾并不能说明他们无法工作]

- 3. Just because the market is going up doesn't mean that it won't come back down.[仅仅因为市场在上涨并不意味着它不会回落]

# 2.social bonds [社交关系]
> social bonds are like our relationships or connections to other people in society.a "bond" is another word for a "tie".so we are all tied together in our community or in our country.

# 3.abundance [adj.大量；充足；丰富] & bombarded /bɑːmˈbɑːrdɪd/ [v.连续轰炸]
> 1)so abundance is a great word that just means so much of sth good.like almost too much of it."adbundance" tends to be a lot of sth good.

- 1. Our country has been blessed with an abundance of natural resources.[我们国家很幸运能拥有丰富的自然资源]

- 2. Clearly there is abundant evidence to back up her claims, so why are we dismissing her?[显然她的说法有充分的证据支撑，为什么我们要驳斥她呢]

- 3. If you want to experience a life of abundance, gratitude is the key.[如果你想要度过充实的一生，感恩是关键]

> 2)"bombarded" is usually sth bad.we tend to use it when we are overwhelmed by information like advertising,or messaging,or texts,or phone calls.

- 1. Their ad campaign has bombarded TV screens and web browsers for weeks.[他们的广告宣传已经霸屏电视和浏览器好几周了]

- 2. Would I be able to call you back tomorrow? We're getting bombarded with calls today.[我可以明天再给你回电话吗？今天我们这的电话打爆了]

- 3. There is nothing I hate more than getting bombarded with spam email.[我最讨厌被垃圾邮件轰炸了]

# 4.gift economy [n.礼物经济]
> basically,what we're talking about is all of the giving,but also all of these social bonds and all of these people who feel like,"Oh,that guy got me a present,so I must get him a present."

# 5.obligation [义务] & obliged 
> 1)obligation is sth that you must do,if so-and-so buys you a present,you feel like,"Oh!I got to get them a present too."

> 2)obliged is a feeling,you think about a very polite cowboy,"Much obliged,ma'am,much obliged."very courteous.If sb invites you to their birthday,you feel obliged to invite them to your birthday.

# 5.reciprocity /ˌresɪˈprɑːsət̬i/ [n.互助；互惠；互换]
> we use this a lot to talk about like relationships,like a relationship can be based on reciprocity and that's just the act of giving stuff to each other to kind of  benefit each other.

# 6.ssentimentality /ˌsent̬əmen'tæləti/ [adj.多愁善感]
> so sentimentality, that's like referring to all these good emotions that we get that can motivate us to go out and buy gifts for other people.

# 7.preclude /prəˈkluːd/ [v.阻碍；排除，防止，杜绝] & exclude 
> 1)so to preclude basically means to prevent.for example,if you get bad grades in high school,that will preclude you from going to university,or maybe his super intelligence precluded him from having a normal life.

> 2)exclude basically just saying you are not part of this group,you can't join this group or you can't enter this.

# 8.lavish /ˈlævɪʃ/ [adj.奢华的]
> if sth is lavish,it's expensive or it's very decadent.you can have a lavish lifestyle,people throw lavish weddings.

# 9.qualitative /ˈkwɑːləteɪt̬ɪv/ [adj.质量的，性质的]
> we use this often when we're talking about research.qualitative research is like listening to people's speeches or looking at a photograph.you can't measure thsoe.quantitative research is the oppsite,that's the type of research that we can measure like data.we can measure or counts.

- 1. A good manager should consider qualitative factors such as morale when making a decision.[一个好的管理者在做决定时应该考虑像士气这种定性因素]

- 2. I thought I'd be really bored by this class on qualitative research methods, but I was wrong![我本以为上这节定性研究方法课我会特别无聊，但我错了！]

- 3. She argues that there is no qualitative difference between humans and animals.[她认为人和动物之间没有本质的区别]

# 10.transactional /trænˈzækʃənəl/ [adj.交易的]

# III.pattern
***Did you finish all of your holiday shopping, Patrick?***

***Barely! Checking everyone off my gift list gets more exhausting every year. Why do we do this to ourselves?***

***Well, giving strengthens social bonds and at the same time brings us an abundance of joy, right?***

***We're certainly bombarded with that message every year. But if you think about it, the gift economy has always been based on obligation, not joy.***

***Courtesy demands reciprocity, that's true.***

***But does it demand one trillion dollars' worth? It's hard not to see that behind all of the sentimentality is just naked profit-seeking.***

***Well, just because the gift economy is big business doesn't preclude me from feeling joy.***

***Is that why you always give personalized handmade gifts?***

***I know they're not all that lavish, but by giving them I want to emphasize that we have a qualitative relationship, not just a transactional one.***

***I wonder if people feel the same way about my Amazon gift cards!***
