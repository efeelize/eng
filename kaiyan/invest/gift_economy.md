# I.tips for picking gifts
# 1.give problem-solves
> When it comes to how to pick gifts, find a problem in your recipient's life and solve it with your generosity. For examples: Get their knives sharpened, buy them black-out blinds, or pay for a handyman to go to their house and fix up the little things like squeaky doors, broken light switches, and leaking sinks.

# 2. don't give them more problems
> People don't like having to make decisions, so don't pick a gift that makes them decide. When you buy someone a gift card, you're giving them a problem by passing the decision-making burden to them. For example, if you gift a massage or cooking lessons, schedule it, too. So they don't have to decide.

# 3.be practical,not flashy
> Our choices in gifts tend to be selfish. We want the glory of being great gift-givers, so we buy presents with a maximum bedazzlement factor. Flashy flowers, for example.

# 4.put the "present" in presentation
> Write a thoughtful letter full of sentiments. Disguise a small gift in a giant package, make it a scavenger hunt, or wrap a gag gift and reveal the real one afterward.

# II.grammar
# 1.just because...doesn't mean ...
> This is a pretty useful pattern for when you are debating with people. Patrick argues that the gift economy is a way for big businesses to make money. Rob's counterpoint is that while that may be true, the consequences
of that do not mean that he cannot still feel joy in giving.

> We're not limited to the word "preclude" in this pattern. A more common pattern is: Just because A doesn't mean B. This means that although A may be true, it doesn't follow that B is also true. We can use other words
that are synonymous with mean, such as "imply" or "indicate."

# III.pattern
***Did you finish all of your holiday shopping, Patrick?***

***Barely! Checking everyone off my gift list gets more exhausting every year. Why do we do this to ourselves?***

***Well, giving strengthens social bonds and at the same time brings us an abundance of joy, right?***

***We're certainly bombarded with that message every year. But if you think about it, the gift economy has always been based on obligation, not joy.***

***Courtesy demands reciprocity, that's true.***

***But does it demand one trillion dollars' worth? It's hard not to see that behind all of the sentimentality is just naked profit-seeking.***

***Well, just because the gift economy is big business doesn't preclude me from feeling joy.***

***Is that why you always give personalized handmade gifts?***

***I know they're not all that lavish, but by giving them I want to emphasize that we have a qualitative relationship, not just a transactional one.***

***I wonder if people feel the same way about my Amazon gift cards!***
