# I.History of the Wire Transfer
> The first widely used service for wire transfers [电汇] was launched by Western Union [西联汇款] in 1872 on its existing telegraph network [其现存电报网络]. Using passwords and code books [密码和编码本], a telegraph operator in one office could "wire" money that had been paid to that office by the sending customer to another telegraph office to be paid out to the receiving customer. One of the largest companies that offer wire transfer is Western Union, which allows individuals to transfer or receive money without an account [账号]with Western Union or any financial institution [任何金融机构]. Most international transfers are completed through SWIFT [SWIFT代码], a co-operative society [合作社团] founded in 1974 by seven international banks [国际银行], which operate a global network to do the transferring of financial messages.[用于在国际间传递金融信息]

> Other forms of electronic transfers include, for example, electronic funds transfer system (EFTS)[电子基金转账系统]. This is the system one uses when a customer gives his/her bank account number and routing number  [银行代码]to someone, like a bank or institution [金融机构]. An EFTS payment is like an electronic personal check [电子的私人支票]. In the United States, EFTS transfers are often called ACH transfers because they are done through the Automated Clearing House[可以通过自动清算所完成].
