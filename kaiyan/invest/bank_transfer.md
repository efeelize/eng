# I.History of the Wire Transfer
> The first widely used service for wire transfers [电汇] was launched by Western Union [西联汇款] in 1872 on its existing telegraph network [其现存电报网络]. Using passwords and code books [密码和编码本], a telegraph operator in one office could "wire" money that had been paid to that office by the sending customer to another telegraph office to be paid out to the receiving customer. One of the largest companies that offer wire transfer is Western Union, which allows individuals to transfer or receive money without an account [账号]with Western Union or any financial institution [任何金融机构]. Most international transfers are completed through SWIFT [SWIFT代码], a co-operative society [合作社团] founded in 1974 by seven international banks [国际银行], which operate a global network to do the transferring of financial messages.[用于在国际间传递金融信息]

> Other forms of electronic transfers include, for example, electronic funds transfer system (EFTS)[电子基金转账系统]. This is the system one uses when a customer gives his/her bank account number and routing number  [银行代码]to someone, like a bank or institution [金融机构]. An EFTS payment is like an electronic personal check [电子的私人支票]. In the United States, EFTS transfers are often called ACH transfers because they are done through the Automated Clearing House[可以通过自动清算所完成].

# 2.wiret transfer [n.电汇]
> 1)this word "wire", this is kind of an older word, when, you know, transfers were starting,it's called a telegraphic wire. but these days, you know, you can just say transfer, "I'd like to make a transfer".

> 2)it's interesting to know that the word "wire" as, like as a verb.you might say "I need to wire some money to a friend."but you often hear, you know, or I need to wire some money to my, tax free, accounting.

# 3.remittance /rɪ'mɪtns/ [n.汇款] & remit [v.] & SWITF code [Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.] & routing number [n.汇款路径号]
> 1)So remittance here is a fancy word for sending money.it's the technical word, just transfer.You don't need to say this, but yeah, when you fill the application, yeah, it will say remittance.the teller /'tɛlɚ/ [n.(银行)出纳员] says to the customer, "For international remittance, you need some codes, some numbers."

> 2) the routing number. It looks kind of funny but it's just a number of the institution [n.机构], your bank's special number.

# 4.blank check [n.空头支票] & if you have blank check to do sth & account number [n.账号] & beneficiary /ˌbɛnɪ'fɪʃɪɛri/ [n.收款人、受益人] & recipient [n.收款人] & receiver 
> 1)We don't really use checks anymore, but often times, when I go to the bank, I still need something that's like a blank check.because they want to put money into my bank account,they need to know that information.if you look at a check like for writing money, the numbers are on the bottom of the check.

> 2)"If you have a blank check to do something".It just means you can do whatever you want.do whatever you want. You have permission to do anything.

> 3) Also on the bottom of this, check is your account number.It's really important one. That's the one that even if you don't do international remittance.

> 4)the teller needs is the beneficiary's name.so the beneficiary is the person who is receiving the money.You don't need to use this word, but it will be on the application.

> 5)And beneficiaries are also often used for things like insurance,or a will.

> 6)"recipient" and "beneficiary" are the same, basically in this case. "Recipient" is a little less formal.And that just means receiver, right?Yeah, we will hear "receiver" and you won't see that at the bank. They won't let…Maybe the person might ask "Who is the receiver?" But you won't see it written down anywhere.

# 5.currency /'kɝənsi/ [n.货币] & foreign currency [n.外汇] & exchange rate [n.汇率] & rate [利率] & transfer fee [n.转账费] & charged [v.收费] & cover the charge [v.承担]
> 1）so they charged fees,just they make you pay,they are asking for money, like often lawyers, they charge so much money per hour.

> 2)In this case, it just means, "I'll pay for it". "I'll take care of it".It's my responsibility.So you'll always see this whenever you transfer money. These days you can transfer money.Like online, really easily. There's always that choice "Who is going to pay for the fee".

# 6.fees & fare /fɛr/ 
> 1) other places that have fees are like, a university has fees.Tuition /tʊ'ɪʃən/ [n.学费] fees, entrance fees [入场费] to like a concert or even a university.

> 2)We don't use fee for buses or taxis or subways. That's a different word.we use "Fare"

# 7.go through [phr.通过]
> 1)we still need to use this expression, to mean, like, it's actually being completed.and you'll often see this like a proposal, or an application, can go through. That's when it's accepted.

> 2)And if you ever use your bank card or maybe a credit card at a restaurant or a store somewhere, and maybe there's a problem with it.It was declined. The person might say, "Oh, sorry, it didn't go through." it wasn't accepted.
