# I.History of the Wire Transfer
> The first widely used service for wire transfers [电汇] was launched by Western Union [西联汇款] in 1872 on its existing telegraph network [其现存电报网络]. Using passwords and code books [密码和编码本], a telegraph operator in one office could "wire" money that had been paid to that office by the sending customer to another telegraph office to be paid out to the receiving customer. One of the largest companies that offer wire transfer is Western Union, which allows individuals to transfer or receive money without an account [账号]with Western Union or any financial institution [任何金融机构]. Most international transfers are completed through SWIFT [SWIFT代码], a co-operative society [合作社团] founded in 1974 by seven international banks [国际银行], which operate a global network to do the transferring of financial messages.[用于在国际间传递金融信息]

> Other forms of electronic transfers include, for example, electronic funds transfer system (EFTS)[电子基金转账系统]. This is the system one uses when a customer gives his/her bank account number and routing number  [银行代码]to someone, like a bank or institution [金融机构]. An EFTS payment is like an electronic personal check [电子的私人支票]. In the United States, EFTS transfers are often called ACH transfers because they are done through the Automated Clearing House[可以通过自动清算所完成].

# II.Transferring money between banks
> When you transfer money between banks — called an external transfer [外部转账] — there can be fees and it might take days. These transfers are processed through the Automated Clearing electronic [自动清算所] network, much like other ACH transfers such as bill payments and direct deposit.[直接入账等其他ACH转账类似]

> While transfers between accounts at the same bank can be instant [行内转账可以即时到账], you generally must wait for bank-to-bank transfers to process before funds get delivered [等待资金到账]. Some banks and credit unions [信用社] don’t charge for external transfers, but others assess a small fee, typically $10 or less. And this applies only to online transfers.[只有线上转账收取手续费]

> ACH transfers usually take a few business days to process, and nearly every financial institution has a cutoff /'kʌt'ɔf/ time [截止时间] for transfer requests. Respecting [留心] these will help your money arrive on time. If you submit a transfer request after the cutoff - around the end of the business day [工作日结束时] - it generally won’t be processed until the next business day.[转账请求只有等到下个工作日才能得到处理]

> Weekends and bank holidays don’t count as business days [周末和银行假期不属于工作日]. If you initiate /ɪ'nɪʃɪet/ [vt.开始] a transfer request at 11 p.m. on the Friday before a three-day holiday weekend, the money might not reach its destination until the following Thursday.[等到下周周四才能到账]

# III.grammar
# 1.make + 
> We often use “do” with certains gerunds /'dʒɛrənd/ [n.动名词] or activities (ex: do the dishes), but English also uses “make” with many nouns instead of a basic verb. We often use an adjective before the noun as well to change the degree.

# 2.wiret transfer [n.电汇]
> 1)this word "wire", this is kind of an older word, when, you know, transfers were starting,it's called a telegraphic wire. but these days, you know, you can just say transfer, "I'd like to make a transfer".

> 2)it's interesting to know that the word "wire" as, like as a verb.you might say "I need to wire some money to a friend."but you often hear, you know, or I need to wire some money to my, tax free, accounting.

# 3.remittance /rɪ'mɪtns/ [n.汇款] & remit [v.] & SWITF code [Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.] & routing number [n.汇款路径号]
> 1)So remittance here is a fancy word for sending money.it's the technical word, just transfer.You don't need to say this, but yeah, when you fill the application, yeah, it will say remittance.the teller /'tɛlɚ/ [n.(银行)出纳员] says to the customer, "For international remittance, you need some codes, some numbers."

> 2) the routing number. It looks kind of funny but it's just a number of the institution [n.机构], your bank's special number.

# 4.blank check [n.空头支票] & if you have blank check to do sth  & paycheck /'pe,tʃɛk/ [n.薪水] 
> 1)so checks are kind of going the way of the dodo /'dodo/ [n.过时的东西], they are not as popular as they used to be.check actually means that kind of physical piece of paper, That has the kind of numbers, or that the payment that you're getting.and your name on it. It will always say, you know, "Pay to Lisa, eight hundred eighty eight dollars and eighty eight cents.We don't really use checks anymore, but often times, when I go to the bank, I still need something that's like a blank check.because they want to put money into my bank account,they need to know that information.if you look at a check like for writing money, the numbers are on the bottom of the check.

> 2)"If you have a blank check to do something".It just means you can do whatever you want.do whatever you want. You have permission to do anything.

> 3)we also use it for our paycheque, so it doesn't have to be a physical thing.Now one thing that a lot of people do as soon as they get their paycheques, or soon as they get any kind of cheques, is they use that money to pay off bills.

# 5.currency /'kɝənsi/ [n.货币] & foreign currency [n.外汇] & exchange rate [n.汇率] & rate [利率] & transfer fee [n.转账费] & charged [v.收费] & cover the charge [v.承担]
> 1）so they charged fees,just they make you pay,they are asking for money, like often lawyers, they charge so much money per hour.

> 2)In this case, it just means, "I'll pay for it". "I'll take care of it".It's my responsibility.So you'll always see this whenever you transfer money. These days you can transfer money.Like online, really easily. There's always that choice "Who is going to pay for the fee".

# 6.fees & fare /fɛr/ 
> 1) other places that have fees are like, a university has fees.Tuition /tʊ'ɪʃən/ [n.学费] fees, entrance fees [入场费] to like a concert or even a university.

> 2)We don't use fee for buses or taxis or subways. That's a different word.we use "Fare"

# 7.go through [phr.通过]
> 1)we still need to use this expression, to mean, like, it's actually being completed.and you'll often see this like a proposal, or an application, can go through. That's when it's accepted.

> 2)And if you ever use your bank card or maybe a credit card at a restaurant or a store somewhere, and maybe there's a problem with it.It was declined. The person might say, "Oh, sorry, it didn't go through." it wasn't accepted.

# 8.of the month [每个月重复的日期]
> We use the phrase “of the month” to refer to a date that repeats each month, or when the specific month does not need to be mentioned [不需要提及特定月份的日期]. It’s commonly used for repeating events, like paying bills or rent, which usually happen on the same day each month.

- 1. I pay my rent on the last day of the month.

- 2. She gets paid twice a month: on the 1st and 15th of the month.

- 3. A: Thanksgiving is in November, but I can't remember which day. B: It's on the fourth Thursday of the month.

# 9.declined [v.拒绝] & insufficient fund [n.存款不足] 
> 1)if you're paying for something, and we still use cards here, we don't use like WeChat Pay or Alipay here. other than cards, you can also decline someone's request.but the difference is that decline is much more polite, reject is a little rude.

> 2)if your card was declined, then you know what, the person at the store might say, "I'm sorry, that transaction failed."The transaction failed or didn't go through.

> 3）insufficient, first of all, means not enough.It's also a very formal, polite way to say not enough. Now, funds, really just means some amount of money.and we usually use this as a chunk, insufficient fund.like if you're paying with your card, insufficient funds will be on the screen.Now is it possible to say "insufficient money"?because like you said, it's a chunk, we say this as a phrase. But we say "funds" in lots of other ways, that just means money.so for example, maybe someone needs to raise money for charity, they might say, "We need to raise some funds."

# 10.issued 
> 1)So if they're issued, then they're released or given out.And it's usually official things like when you get a new passport, the passport is issued to you.issuing is often something that is done by the government or some kind of like official organization like a bank.

> 2)Even a company, when a company is in trouble, they might issue a statement, which is a different kind of statement. it's just something that they say officially, it's not related or it doesn't have to be related to money.

# 11.automatic payment [n.自动还款] & automatic 
> 1)so it does it automatically, it does it by itself.for example, on the 15th of every month, my money will automatically come out of my bank account and will go on to my visa.

> 2)so many things these days are automatic.the main idea here is that it just makes things easier. Like when you walk into a store, the doors open. I don't even have to push the door, they are automatic doors, like on a bus or in a store or on a camera. Cameras all have an automatic focus...So we don't have to do it ourselves, we can be lazy.

# 12.credit card/bank statements [n.银行对账单] & keep track of [phr.记录]
> 1)a bank statement, it's a record like history of all of your deposits /dɪ'pɑzɪt/ [n.存款] and withdrawals /wɪð'drɔəl/ [n.提款]. So basically, it just tells you everything that you've spent.so normally when you look at your credit card/bank statement, it will have a list of all your transactions.If I bought a coffee, that's a transaction; if I took out some money when I was traveling, that's a transaction.

> 2) it doesn't just have to be at your bank, it could be like a phone bill, it's kind of a statement, some people say mobile phone statement.But you know what, it's just easier to say phone bill.

> 3) if they're keeping track of this, then they're following it, they're constantly checking this.keep track or following, for example, you could keep track of the news, you're always looking for new news updates.Parents, they're always trying to keep track of their kids when their kids are running around and fighting and playing.Or maybe if you have some friends over, you're watching a game, you want to keep track of the score.

> 4)if you're late for a meeting, you can say, "Oh sorry, I lost track of the time."If you're having a lot of fun, it's hard to keep track of time.

# 13.hidden fees [n.隐藏费用]
> So hidden fee, it's not a secret fee, but it's not easy to find, that it's not easy to know about.it's basically another way that the bank tricks you into paying more money.When you sign up for a product, there's like a little tiny writing that says there is a one dollar fee or there is a whatever dollar fee for this kind of transfer or something else.for example, like phone bills. Often when you sign up for a new type of phone service, there's a lot of hidden fees like a hidden service fee.I wish companies would tell us everything that we have to pay, not try to keep it a secret.

# 14.account number [n.账号] & beneficiary /ˌbɛnɪ'fɪʃɪɛri/ [n.收款人、受益人] & recipient [n.收款人] & receiver
> 1) Also on the bottom of this, check is your account number.It's really important one. That's the one that even if you don't do international remittance.

> 2)the teller needs is the beneficiary's name.so the beneficiary is the person who is receiving the money.You don't need to use this word, but it will be on the application.

> 3)And beneficiaries are also often used for things like insurance,or a will.

> 4)"recipient" and "beneficiary" are the same, basically in this case. "Recipient" is a little less formal.And that just means receiver, right?Yeah, we will hear "receiver" and you won't see that at the bank. They won't let…Maybe the person might ask "Who is the receiver?" But you won't see it written down anywhere.
