# I.a step-by-step gude to choosing a Health Insurance Plan in the US

> you can get your health insurance plan through your employer.If your company doesn't provide health insurance,shop on your state's public marketplace or the federal marketplace to find the lowest premiums.

# 2.compare types of health insurance plans
> the most common types of health insurance plans are HMOs,PPOs,EPOs or POS.while comparing,remember to take your family's medical needs into consideration.

# 3.compare health plan networks
> costs are lower when you go to an in-network doctor because insurance companies contract lower rates with in-network providers,while out-of-network doctors don't have agreed-upon rates,and you're typically on the hook for a higher portion of the cost.

# 4.compare out-of-pocket costs
> the cost consist of deductibles,copayments and coinsurance,the total you spend of pocket in  a year is limited.Generally,the lower your premium,the higher your out-of-pocket costs.

# 5.compare benefits
> Go over the summary of benefits to see if any of the plans cover a wider scope of service.It can also be helpful to make calls and ask lingering questions.

# II.grammar
# 1.roughly speaking 
> When you are buying health insurance, or indeed insurance of any kind, there are lots of numbers that you will have to deal with. Most of those numbers will be fairly precise, as insurance companies tend to deal with
very precise figures and tables.

> However, because every customer is different, an insurance agent might not be able to give a customer a precise quote off the top of his head. That's why we see the phrase "roughly speaking" in our dialogue. It's an expression that means "approximately," but is much more colloquial. You can use it whenever you want to give information that is general and not exact.

- 1. Roughly speaking, you are considered rich if you have over three million dollars.[粗略地说，如果你拥有超过三百万美元，就会被认为是富人]

- 2. There were about 50 people at Bob's retirement party, roughly speaking.[粗略地说，大约有50人参加了Bob的退休聚会]

- 3. Roughly speaking, a conservative investment portfolio should double every 7 to 8 years.[粗略地说，一个保守的投资组合应该每7到8年翻一番]

# 2.coverage /ˈkʌvɚɪdʒ/ [n.承保范围]
> coverage is a word that we always use with insurance,and it just basically means what the company will pay for.

- 1. We are much happier with the coverage of our new insurance policy.[我们对新的保险政策的覆盖范围更满意]

- 2. I was under the false impression that my coverage was more generous.[我错误地以为我的保险覆盖范围更大]

- 3. What is the basic coverage that I need to drive this car for a few months?[开这辆车几个月所需的基础保险是什么]

# 3.premium /ˈpriːmiəm/ [n.保险费]
> so premium is the other word that you cannot ignore if you are talking about insurance.the premium is basically how much you pay for the policy.regardless of whether or not you get sick and go to the hospital or whatnot,if you have insurance,you're gonna be paying a premium.

# 4.advantageous /ˌædvænˈteɪdʒəs/ [adj.有利的]
> advantage means good things,it could be a benefit to you.So if sth is advantageous to you,it's a benefit to you.

# 5.out-of-pocket [adj.自付的]
> basically it just means,even though you got insurance,you still might have to pay a little extra money out of your pocket.

- 1. You will be reimbursed for any applicable out-of-pocket expenses that you incur.[你自费的任何可申请的费用都可以得到报销]

- 2. Teachers shouldn't have to pay for their classroom supplies out of pocket.[老师不应该需要自掏腰包购买课堂用品]

- 3. I paid out of pocket for my car repairs, because I didn't want the cost of my insurance to go up.[我自掏腰包修车，是因为我不想让我的保险费用上涨]

# 6.deductibles /dɪˈdʌktəbəlz/ [n.自付额]
> it is basically a set amount of money that you have to pay first.before the insurance company is going to even dream of giving you a penny,you have to meet the deductible or reach the deductible.basically the expense like a hospital or a doctor's office would have to reach the number.

# 7.co-pays [n.共付额] & co-insurance [n.共同保险]
> 1)to see the doctor costs a certain amount of money,but when you have a co-pay,basically it just means the insurance company is going to pay X and you're going to pay Y.

# 8.bronze /silver /gold /platinum
- we often use these word to describle different levels of things.when we talking about different health insurance plans,gold and platinum woule be different here in the services that they offer,and platinum is better than gold.

# 9.in-network  [adj.网络内的]
> so according to whatever insurance you have,you will only be able to see certain doctors that are in-network with that insurance company.

# 10.dependents [n.（孩子、家人等）需供养者]
> to qualify as a dependent,usually,you have to be below 18 years old,so you're still legally a minor,not an adult.but in some places in the states,that can be extended into the early or maybe even mid-twenties in which case you could still be on your parents' insurance plan and be able to take advantage of a host of extended coverage options.

- 1. Having a dependent opens the door to a wide range of tax exemptions.[有了受抚养人，就可以获得更多的免税待遇]

- 2. You'd better check with an accountant to see if you claim your mother as a dependent.[你最好向会计师咨询一下，看看是否把你母亲作为受赡养人]

# III.pattern
***Hi James, so you're thinking of upgrading your health insurance plan from Gold to Platinum?***

***Yes, I was hoping you could break down the differences in cost and coverage for me.***

***Well, the Platinum plan does carry a slightly higher monthly premium, but that could be advantageous depending on your situation.***

***Because the plan requires fewer out-of-pocket costs?***

***Yes, the Gold plan covers 80% of costs, and the Platinum about 90%, which means that deductibles, copays and co-insurance would all be lower.***

***So what would I end up paying to see the doctor or for surgery?***

***You'd pay nothing for in-network doctor's visits and around 30% of the cost of hospitalization. A trip to the emergency room would set you back $150, roughly speaking.***

***I see. We have some pre-existing conditions in our family so that might be the smartest option in the long run.***

***Of course your dependents will be fully covered, and they will also be able to take advantage of a host of extended coverage options, like dental and vision.***

***Well, that's probably the way to go then. The Platinum plan it is!***
