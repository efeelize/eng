# I.Want an easier way to send your money? 
> Out with the old and in with the new![科技换代日新月异] Dublin based software company Daon has created a way for people to send money through voice recognition software [语音识别软件]. The feature, which is available through Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa [虚拟助理Alexa], will allow users to access their bank accounts and then transfer money with voice commands. However, the process is not completely hands-free [解放双手], as users will still have to use their phones to confirm the transfer via voice, picture, fingerprint or a pin [pin码]. Nonetheless [尽管如此], the software appears to have potential, and Doan has said that several banks have plans to adopt it within the next year and a half.[几家银行计划在未来一年半内采用该软件]

***Hey, Mick. Would you mind transferring me the money on your phone?***

***Right now? To be honest, I don’t have mobile banking.***

***Really? Man, you are behind! Why don’t you just download the bank app now?***

***I would but I’m kind of paranoid about security. What if someone hacks my account?***

***It’ll be fine! Bank apps are pretty secure. Besides, it makes it so much easier to manage your finances and make credit card payments on the go.***

***That’s true. Could I also use it to check on my investments?***

***For sure. You can also track your spending, deposit cheques and pay off all sorts of bills. The only issue is that it’s sometimes a bit laggy.***

***Ok. I’ll test it out. But, if I get robbed, I’m coming after you!***

***Trust me! You won’t get robbed!***
