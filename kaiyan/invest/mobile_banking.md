# I.Want an easier way to send your money? 
> Out with the old and in with the new![科技换代日新月异] Dublin based software company Daon has created a way for people to send money through voice recognition software [语音识别软件]. The feature, which is available through Amazon’s virtual assistant Alexa [虚拟助理Alexa], will allow users to access their bank accounts and then transfer money with voice commands. However, the process is not completely hands-free [解放双手], as users will still have to use their phones to confirm the transfer via voice, picture, fingerprint or a pin [pin码]. Nonetheless [尽管如此], the software appears to have potential, and Doan has said that several banks have plans to adopt it within the next year and a half.[几家银行计划在未来一年半内采用该软件]

# II.grammar
# 1.pay off & pay for & pay & make payments [phr.还钱]
> 1)"Pay something off” means to pay a debt completely. It is generally used for large debts[长期大额债务], like houses, cars and student loans, that are paid for over a long time The past participle /'pɑrtə'sɪpl/ [n.<语>分词] form [过去分词形式]. of the verb is “paid off.”

> 2)so when you pay off something, maybe you might not feel so good, because you know, what your bank account make drop. Because when you pay off your bill, then your bill is done, it's finish, you paid all the money.so some of us aren't as lucky as others. We all have bills, but we don't all have enough money to pay off our bills completely. You can pay your credit card bill, or you can pay your electricity bill, whatever. But if you don't have enough money, then you know, you're not going to pay it off.But, if you have already, then we would say it has been paid off.

> 3)but when we're talking about like a big debt, like a mortgage for your house, that takes a long time to pay off.Or maybe your car payments.So this is another thing that will take a long time to pay off.

> 4)“Pay for” is followed by the thing that was purchased [通常接购买的东西]. You can pay for a meal, a pair of shoes, even a house. We also use it when we pay instead of someone else [为别人付钱时] (e.g., I paid for my girlfriend.) It is even used when we make up for a mistake or crime that is committed.[为所犯的错误或罪行买单]

> 5)We use "pay" followed by a bill [账单], fee [费用], monthly payment [月度费用], etc. For large purchases [针对大额的交易], "pay off" is followed by the entire debt [全部债务] or thing that was bought (e.g., pay off my car), while "pay" is used for the smaller, monthly fee [小额、月度的费用] (e.g., pay the first installment /in'stɔ:lmənt/ [n.分期] on my car [支付车贷月供]).

> 6)so just keep that in mind, you can say, pay your bills, pay off your bills. The difference is... the very small difference, but it is important.

> 7)a payment. This is basically when you pay off a bill.

- 1. It took me 5 years to pay off my car.

- 2. One way or another, you'll have to pay for your mistakes.

- 3. My wife and I have been paying our mortgage /'mɔrɡɪdʒ/ payments [n.按揭贷款] for 20 years and now it is finally all paid off!

# 2.transferring [v.转账] & mobile banking [n.手机银行] & on the go [phr.随时] & check on investment [v.查询] & keep track [phr.注意动向]
> 1）transfer money. Transfer is something that if you are living abroad probably need to know. transferring money, you probably have to transfer it from your bank account in China to may be your bank account in America.You can also transfer money to a friend or maybe to another bank account.

> 2)Basically mobile just means that you are moving around.so you don't have to go to a bank, which doesn't tend to move very much.It stays put. Now of course, not everybody uses mobile banking, not everybody has downloaded these apps, not everybody really trusts their phone with their money, but people that don't often...Well, some people might think that they are a little bit behind.

> 3)that means that, you're kind of constantly moving around,And we can use it in general to just describe people who are busy, like she's always on the go.we're all really busy,I got places to go, people to see. So, if I'm on the go, it means I'm probably using my app here to hail /hel/ [v.招呼] a taxi, and I'm paying my credit card bills, and I'm doing everything while I am moving.

> 4)checking on investments, you could say both, like, check your investments, check your accounts, check on usually... usually means that there has been some kind of change.

> 5)I think we also like check on something to make sure that it's still okay. So for example, if your friend is sick, maybe you will go and check on her.

> 6)so maybe you could keep track of your hours at work, or maybe you can keep track of your steps, if you have a step counter.Or if your friend is flying in from another country, you can always track that flight, too.So, there are a lot of things that you can track, but here we're talking about tracking spending [n.花费].

# 3.being behind [adv.落后的、落伍的] & laggy [adj.滞后的、延迟的] & lag /læɡ/ [v.迟延] & jet lag [n.时差感] & lag behind  & test it out [phr.测试一下] 
> 1）If you're behind, that means everybody is way ahead of you.and they're way ahead of you, because they are using new technology.it means that they are kind of going a little bit slower than other people.

> 2)so tracking your spending, depositing cheques, and paying off your bills are all good things that you can do with mobile banking, but there is an issue, and that is that sometimes it's a bit laggy.when you're streaming /'strimɪŋ/ [n.浏览] something, like maybe a youtube video, it might get a little laggy, it will stop, and then you will usually see like a percentage on the screen, sixty-seven percent, eighty-nine percent, and then it will start again, and then it will stop.and sometimes it actually happens with mobile banking apps.

> 3) a lag is when you have kind of a delay.

> 4)so one lag that might be very very very well-known, is jet lag. You just feel very slow and tired.

> 5)you can also lag behind,especially if you're running.You might end up lagging behind others.

> 6)so test something out. You might know test as something that you have to do at school, it's not very fun.It's kind of a verb here, if you test something, you kind of see if it works.And testing something out just makes it sound more colloquial /kə'lokwɪəl/ [adj.口语的].and you can kind of think about it as mixing test with try out.

# 4.paranoid /'pærənɔɪd/ [adj.过度紧张] & paranoia /ˌpærə'nɔɪə/ [n.<医>妄想狂,偏执狂]
> 1) This word is paranoid. This is how I sometimes feel about mobile apps, especially when they have to do with banking.I can understand that. So paranoid just means that you're kind of excessively worried.you're thinking too much, which as you guys know, I think too much, and you're really worried about something.so for example, for me, I'm always paranoid about being late, so I show up really really early.

> 2)paranoia, which is the noun,it can also be really serious though, like a sick person, sick in the head.This person might be worried about the government, the government is going to come and get them.it's always like the government, or some some kind of organization. The lizard people man, they control the money, the lizard people control the money, man.That's true. So they have all these kind of theories.

# 5.security & safety & being insecure [phr.不自信]
> 1)security, we often use this word with banking, or information, or more like abstract things.it could also be used for buildings,the security guard, we don't call him the safety guard,just security [n.保安].

> 2)so safety is something that's a little bit more related to your body. so usually you are really concerned about the safety of your children.So because frequently they follow, sometimes they get kidnapped.

> 3) so if you're insecure, it just means that you're not confident about something.Because usually we talk about information or systems as being secure or not secure, but when we talk about people, we talk about being insecure or not insecure.if you're secure, then it means that you're confident and you're not worried, but maybe you know what, a lot of us are insecure about our bodies.

# 6.finances [n & v.财务] & financial /faɪ'nænʃl/ [adj.财政的,金融的] & investments [n.投资] & deposit /dɪ'pɑzɪt/ [v.存款]
> 1) finances is a more academic word for money.finances is talking about kind of all your money.It's like your personal money, like, well is... finance is something that you might study at school, or you might, for example, your job might be in the finance department.

> 2)finance can also be a verb.That's when you finance something, you kind of pay for it, you often lend someone money to invest.

> 2) financial is actually an adjective, but here we are talking about a noun. 

> 3) if you ever watch any commercials on TV for these banking apps, you'll always see, you know, like a guy wearing a suit, and he... he's looking at his phone, he has a big smile on his face, because he's checking his investments and they have all been very good.

> 4) something else you can do with these wonderful apps is to deposit checks.Actually I really liked it, depositing things. so what do you deposit it? You put it into your bank account?

# 7.come after [phr.找某人算账]
> So you can just use this basically as a joke, right? To say that, hey you know what if you do that, I'm coming after you.To be honest, I frequently use this with my sister when I was a child. Because she used to eat all the cookies before I got home...a lot of anger of that.

# III.pattern
***Hey, Mick. Would you mind transferring me the money on your phone?***

***Right now? To be honest, I don’t have mobile banking.***

***Really? Man, you are behind! Why don’t you just download the bank app now?***

***I would but I’m kind of paranoid about security. What if someone hacks my account?***

***It’ll be fine! Bank apps are pretty secure. Besides, it makes it so much easier to manage your finances and make credit card payments on the go.***

***That’s true. Could I also use it to check on my investments?***

***For sure. You can also track your spending, deposit cheques and pay off all sorts of bills. The only issue is that it’s sometimes a bit laggy.***

***Ok. I’ll test it out. But, if I get robbed, I’m coming after you!***

***Trust me! You won’t get robbed!***
