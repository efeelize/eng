# I.what do you know about the GameStop frenzy
# 1.what happened?
> The internet and stock market are aflame over GameStop, the video game retailer whose stock is suddenly the darling of day traders who are putting the squeeze on Wall Street's big players.

> Exactly why GameStop's value — on paper, at least — has rocketed to stratospheric levels has to do with a mix of traditional investing, rampant enthusiasm, stock market mechanics and the belief that anyone with a Robinhood account can meme a fortune into existence.

# 2.what's going on?
> It's called a short squeeze, and it involves investors betting on which way a stock will go — up or down. These bets are placed by buying the shares themselves, or stock options. Investors who bet against a stock are called "shorts." In GameStop's case, the shorts include at least two big hedge funds.

> Shorting a stock essentially means borrowing shares from a broker and selling them, with the agreement you'll return the shares later. When the price falls, you buy back the shares and pocket the difference. But shorting a stock is risky — if the price rises, you can lose big.

# III.pattern 
***Have you been following the GameStop story? It's up like 400% this week!***

***Yeah, but I don't get how a company that's losing so much money can have such a high valuation.***

***Oh, well that's coming as a result of this clash between retail investors and Wall Street.***

***But I thought the hedge funds were shorting the stock, so I don't get why the price is surging.***

***Well, these day traders are pretty sophisticated, and they're using highly leveraged options to push up the price.***

***Is that related to this "short squeeze" I've been hearing so much about?***

***Yes! The stock price keeps going up, which is forcing the hedge fund guys to buy shares to cover their shorts.***

***Oh right, and in so doing, they're pushing the price up even further.***

***Exactly. And of course the media has added to the frenzy too by painting this as an epic battle of good vs.evil and inspiring others to jump in.***

***Well sure, who doesn't like a story where the little guy gets to stick it to the man?***
