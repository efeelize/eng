# gamestop_frenzy
# I.what do you know about the GameStop frenzy
# 1.what happened?
> The internet and stock market are aflame over GameStop, the video game retailer whose stock is suddenly the darling of day traders who are putting the squeeze on Wall Street's big players.

> Exactly why GameStop's value — on paper, at least — has rocketed to stratospheric levels has to do with a mix of traditional investing, rampant enthusiasm, stock market mechanics and the belief that anyone with a Robinhood account can meme a fortune into existence.

# 2.what's going on?
> It's called a short squeeze, and it involves investors betting on which way a stock will go — up or down. These bets are placed by buying the shares themselves, or stock options. Investors who bet against a stock are called "shorts." In GameStop's case, the shorts include at least two big hedge funds.

> Shorting a stock essentially means borrowing shares from a broker and selling them, with the agreement you'll return the shares later. When the price falls, you buy back the shares and pocket the difference. But shorting a stock is risky — if the price rises, you can lose big.

# II.grammar
# 1.in so doing 
> it means because,the difference is "in doing so" is much older and it really does sound a little bit more formal.

- 1. He started three different companies, and in so doing, he became quite rich and famous.[他创立了三家不同的公司，也因此而名利双收]

- 2. They are worried that in so doing, they might be setting a dangerous precedent.[他们担心这样做可能会开创一个危险的先例]

- 3. In so doing, we're sending a message that rowdy behavior is totally unacceptable.[这样做让我们传递出了一个信息：对于粗暴的行为我们是零容忍的]

# 2.valuation [n.估值，估价]
> this is some kind of way of determining or estimating the worth of sth and that's what we call "valuation."

# 3.retail investors [n.散户投资者] & hedge funds [n.对冲基金]
> "retail investors" really just means you don't have that inside information that the pros do.you're just knid of mom-and-pop investing in individual stocks,or maybe in a fund.you definitely are not as professional as those Wall Street guys.

# 4.shorting [n.做空] & options [n.期权] & short squeeze [n.逼空；轧空]
> 1)it's really just talking this idea of "buy low,sell high" and change the order.it's a little bit different than options.

> 2)in the stock market,you have the right to buy a stock at a certain price,but you do not have the obligation to buy.so basically,if the price goes up,you could but that stock at a low price and then pocket the difference.or maybe you believe that price is going to go down,so you can but the right to but a lower price.you're not actually buying any stock here or holding any stock.

> 3)if you're betting that price is going to go down,if you're trying to short a stock and then there's this whole group of people over here that keeps pushing the price up.they're buying these options on their trading apps,then you were going to be in trouble,the price is not going to go down and your bet is going to be wrong,so when "short squeeze” happens,the stock price keeps going up,so all the people that betted against it now actually need to buy all their stock back.

- 1. My uncle lost a significant amount of money trying to short the market last year.[我叔叔去年想要做空，结果亏了一大笔钱]

- 2. Short selling is really not something that the average investor should be doing.[做空真的不是普通投资者应该做的事情]

- 3. Our fund has been long commodities and short retail for years now.[我们的基金多年来一直做多商品、做空零售]

# 5.leveraged [adj.杠杆作用的]
> so "leverage" basically means to lift sth up,but when we're talking about finances,it means to borrow some money to make an investment.

- 1. There are laws that limit how much leverage banks are allowed to use.[有相关法律限制银行可以使用多少杠杆]

- 2. In rising markets, leverage allows investors to increase their returns dramatically.[在上涨的市场中，杠杆能让投资者的收益大幅增加]

- 3. The management wants to pursue a leveraged buyout, but so far they can't find any lenders.[管理层希望进行杠杆收购，但目前还找不到贷款机构]

# 6.frenzy [n.狂热，疯狂]
- 1. When the band started dancing on stage, the teenage girls were whipped into a frenzy.[乐队在台上开始跳舞的时候，年轻的女孩们的情绪变得狂热起来]

- 2. Sometimes the true meaning of our festivals is lost in the frenzy of gift-giving.[有时候我们节日的真正意义在送礼的狂热中丢失了]

# III.pattern 
***Have you been following the GameStop story? It's up like 400% this week!***

***Yeah, but I don't get how a company that's losing so much money can have such a high valuation.***

***Oh, well that's coming as a result of this clash between retail investors and Wall Street.***

***But I thought the hedge funds were shorting the stock, so I don't get why the price is surging.***

***Well, these day traders are pretty sophisticated, and they're using highly leveraged options to push up the price.***

***Is that related to this "short squeeze" I've been hearing so much about?***

***Yes! The stock price keeps going up, which is forcing the hedge fund guys to buy shares to cover their shorts.***

***Oh right, and in so doing, they're pushing the price up even further.***

***Exactly. And of course the media has added to the frenzy too by painting this as an epic battle of good vs.evil and inspiring others to jump in.***

***Well sure, who doesn't like a story where the little guy gets to stick it to the man?***
