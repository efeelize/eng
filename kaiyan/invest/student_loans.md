# I.what do you need to know about America's student loans
> Going to university in the US is expensive – costing an average of over $34,000 a year in tuition and fees at private universities – which means for most Americans, the only way of viably pursuing higher education is to take out a student loan.

> The two main options for prospective students are a government-funded federal loan or a private loan from a provider such as a bank, university or state agency [州立机构]. Both are paid back with interest (interest on federal loans is fixed [利息是固定的] and normally lower than on private loans, which can be expensive and risky and comprise [占] just 14% of student loans).

> Federal loans come in various forms – including direct subsidized [补贴直接贷款], direct unsubsidized [无补贴直接贷款] and direct plus [plus直接贷款] for graduates and professionals. There’s also Direct Plus for parents [家长PLUS直接贷款], where, as the name suggests, the student’s guardians take the full burden.

> Depending on year [学年] and dependency status, undergrads can borrow between $5,500 and $12,500 a year in federal loans; professionals and graduate students have access to up to $20,500 a year. Federal loan repayments are monthly [按月偿还] and start six months after graduation – usually continuing for 10-25 years.

# III.pattern
***Hey Evan, did you know that total student loan debt in America has reached $1.45 trillion?***

***That's astronomical, Albert! Sounds like it's really gotten out of hand.***

***Yeah, and that's only for federal loans. It's even more if you factor in private loans. Almost 45 million Americans currently have outstanding debt.***

***So, do you have any student loan debt?***

***I sure do. For undergrad I took out a loan with a 4.5% interest rate, and for grad school I took out another loan at about 6%.***

***Are you still paying those back? That must put a strain on your wallet.***

***Tell me about it. I managed to pay off my undergrad loans, but I'm still about $40,000 in the hole for grad school.***

***It's a similar situation in Canada. In 2018, recent graduates had an average of just under $28,000 to repay.***

***Wow, that is a lot like the States then.***

***Yeah, to take some of the pressure off of borrowers, the government recently reduced interest rates***

***In America, there's been talk of capping student loan amounts, but nothing has happened yet.***

***In my opinion, these all just sound like temporary solutions at best.***
