In this case the tax return could be the form.It could be that actual paper document, and it also could be the money that they send you back. like when you you file your taxes and then you hopefully get some money back, your tax return. It returns to you,

> 2)So just keep that in mind that we could just say file your taxes, it would pretty much mean the same thing.

> 3)filing a complaint, it's when you kind of send or or store something officially.And there's there's not too many things in the world that that are more official than taxes.

## 2)income tax [收入税、个人所得税] & taxable income [应纳税收入] & taxpayer [纳税人]

## 3)tax bracket /ˈbrækɪt/ [税级] 
> This is basically a little trick where if, let's say the wife makes a little bit more money than the husband, there's a nice little legal loophole that allows them to split that. everyone always talks about brackets in that case. But after March, it's April, that's tax season and then bracket takes on a whole new meaning.so in this case, it's just how much money you make, that determines the rate of taxes that you pay.So if you're making, I mean I don't know what the numbers are, I don't know what the numbers are in America, but you know, if it's under a certain amount of money, you basically pay no tax and if it's a lot of money, you pay a lot of tax.

## 4)income splitting /ˈsplɪtɪŋ/ & splitting one’s income [收入分摊]

> 2) deductible. That's what I'm learning as I get older. And one thing that is always deductible is children, babies. if you have children, you're paying for diapers, you're paying for their school, you're paying for all kinds of like lessons and piano lessons, that cost you a lot of money. And the government wants to help you, they want to invest in the the future generations.

## 6)federal tax [联邦税] & state tax 
> 1)a federal tax, that takes care of other things like the army, the military. I mean we don't have to go into too much, because like things like Obamacare, education they are trying to change and blah blah blah,the other federal government, the national government, they're basically paying the army.

> 2)state tax, provincial tax, it's supposed to take care of things that are kind of closer to you.So a state income tax basically that pays for other things like education and roads and hospitals.so in Washington state like what Seattle is, they don't have state income tax. 

> 3)the biggest difference between Canada and America is that in Canada, we do not have states, we have one state, it is called Canada.we do have provinces, but they're different from states.we have provinces.

## 7)property tax [地产税] & personal residence /ˈrɛzɪdəns/ [私人居所]

You, I suppose you could have an industrial property. you can have all kinds of properties.Intellectual property. 

> 2)if you want to lower your taxable income, it has to be your personal property, your residential.so from what I understand, I'm not a property owner, I'm not a propertied male. From what I understand in Canada, if you have a personal residence, you do not pay near as much property tax. when you have the second property, that's when they really nail you.

## 8)tax burden

# 6.health care [医保] & retirement contributions [养老金] & contributions （给雇主或政府用作医疗保险、养老金等津贴的）[定期缴款] 
> 1)so you know, we all hope to quit our jobs when we're, you know, 65, and live our golden years. but in order to do that, we need to save money. and that's the thing is, you know, Americans aren't really great at saving money. Canadians, I think we used to be, but now we're not so good.this generation is not doing so well.

> 2)but the government has these subtle ways to kind of influence our behavior. One of the ways that they influence us is through the tax code. So if we contribute to our retirement savings, then they will say, "Okay, well, we're not going to tax you on that now, we are going to tax you on it when you, when you withdraw it, when you're older." But the idea is at that time, your income is going to be much lower, so your taxable income will also be lower.

Or like if you take a job far away, you don't want to go to this new job's location, but they compensate for that by giving you a good pay.

> 3) hard-earned here, as a little hyphenated /'haɪfən,etɪd/ [adj.带有连字符号的] adjective. lots of people in Canada that always wonder if their hard-earned dollars are really being put to good use. We do pay taxes, but we just wonder where these taxes are going cause we work hard and and these are hard-earned because we've worked hard to earn that.

# III.pattern
***Hey Laura, did you file your tax returns yet?***

***Yeah, it was such a pain because my husband and I can’t split our income, so he has to pay the tax rates for his tax bracket.***

***That’s too bad. We have income splitting in the US. Did you have any deductions that can lower your taxable income?***

***Well, we benefited from some tax credit on our charitable donations and retirement contributions, but it didn’t make as big of a difference as we had hoped.***

***In the US, property tax on personal residence is deductible. Plus, having our new baby, we get additional credit having a dependent.***

***It does, although doesn’t having universal health care in Canada compensate for higher rates?***

***Yeah, I understand that we pay higher taxes to have better social programs, but I just wonder if my hard- earned dollars are really being put to good use.***

***Yeah, it’s hard to trust the government with so many politicians taking vacations on the taxpayer’s dime.***
