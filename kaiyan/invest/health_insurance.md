# I.advantages and disadvantages of cosmetic surgery
# 1.improved physical health
> In some cases, cosmetic surgery can enhance your physical health. For example, a rhinoplasty surgery, not only will enhance the look and shape of your nose but may also help with respiratory issues that you may have.

> The same goes with liposuction – allowing patients who undergo this surgery to be more physically active after its completion. This, therefore, reduces the chances of developing issues such as an increased blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.

# 2.improved confidence
> By fixing and altering your appearance to suit your wishes, you will automatically have an improved self-esteem. This is one of the greatest benefits of cosmetic surgery for many patients who have lived their whole life unhappy with their exterior.

# 3.expense
> It is not a secret that cosmetic surgeries are expensive. However, this factor makes cosmetic surgery not so 'easily accessible' to everyone, as not everyone obtains such funds. It can be difficult saving up money towards cosmetic surgeries and people often take loans, which can lead to debt.

# 4.mistakes can happen
> Another key risk that should not be overlooked is that cosmetic surgeries can go wrong. For example, a facelift can cause permanent nerve damage which leads to face paralysis. This is undoubtedly a devastating outcome, which should be taken into consideration before undergoing a surgery. These types of errors in surgery will lower your self-esteem even more than it was, prior to the surgery. In extreme cases, these mistakes are irreversible and cannot be fixed.

## 3)inpatient [n.住院病人] & outpatient [n.门诊病人]
