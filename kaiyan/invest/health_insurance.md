# I.advantages and disadvantages of cosmetic surgery
# 1.improved physical health
> In some cases, cosmetic surgery can enhance your physical health. For example, a rhinoplasty surgery, not only will enhance the look and shape of your nose but may also help with respiratory issues that you may have.

> The same goes with liposuction – allowing patients who undergo this surgery to be more physically active after its completion. This, therefore, reduces the chances of developing issues such as an increased blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes.

# 2.improved confidence
> By fixing and altering your appearance to suit your wishes, you will automatically have an improved self-esteem. This is one of the greatest benefits of cosmetic surgery for many patients who have lived their whole life unhappy with their exterior.

# 3.expense
> It is not a secret that cosmetic surgeries are expensive. However, this factor makes cosmetic surgery not so 'easily accessible' to everyone, as not everyone obtains such funds. It can be difficult saving up money towards cosmetic surgeries and people often take loans, which can lead to debt.

# 4.mistakes can happen
> Another key risk that should not be overlooked is that cosmetic surgeries can go wrong. For example, a facelift can cause permanent nerve damage which leads to face paralysis. This is undoubtedly a devastating outcome, which should be taken into consideration before undergoing a surgery. These types of errors in surgery will lower your self-esteem even more than it was, prior to the surgery. In extreme cases, these mistakes are irreversible and cannot be fixed.

# II.grammar
# 1.subject + need to + v. 
> We use need to when we want to talk about something that's necessary for someone to do; and we usually mention who is going to do it. Here’s how you’d form a sentence with need to: subject + need to + verb

- 1. I need to go to the supermarket.[我得去超市]

- 2. You need to pay this bill.[你得付钱]

- 3. They’ll need to park on the other side of the driveway.[他们得停在车道那一边]

# 2.surgery
## 1）botox [n.肉毒杆菌素]
> a lot of people get botox in various parts of their face,just to get rid of the wrinkles.

## 2）double eyelid [n.双眼皮]
> when people get surgery for "double eyelid," we can even just say"I got my eyes done" or "I got my eyelid done.""

***Jaime, Mr. Davis said you had some questions concerning your health insurance plan.***

***Yes, I have many queries. First, what plan are my family and I getting?***

***All our senior executives receive the Gold plan.***

***What does the Gold plan include?***

***You'll receive both dental and vision coverage. You can also opt out of the Gold plan if you are willing to pay a higher monthly premium for the Platinum plan. The Platinum plan covers you when you travel outside of the US.***

***The Gold plan is fine. Is there a deductible?***

***No deductible.***

***Do I need to pay anything for an office visit?***

***Yes, you do. For a primary care doctor you should pay $20, and for a specialist doctor you'll need to pay $40… Oh, and for an urgent care visit it's $55.***

***What about for inpatient hospitalization?***

***You'll need to pay 20%, and for outpatient you'll also need to pay 20%. If you get a lab test you'll need to pay $20 for that, and if you get an x-ray it'll be $40.***

***My wife is pregnant; will all her maternity expenses be covered?***

***She'll need to pay 20%.***

***Is there a significant price gap between purchasing generic and brand prescription drugs?***

***Yes, there is. Generic drugs are $19; where as preferred brands are $50.***

***Wow! That’s quite a difference…What about eye exams? My son has a few eyesight problems and he frequently visits the optometrist.***

***Well, you’re in luck because pediatric eye exams and eyeglasses won’t cost you a penny.***

***Great!***
