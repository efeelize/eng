# II.grammar
# 1.Security & safety & security questions [n.安全问题]
> 1)Security is often used at large organizations such as corporations or governments .

> 2) safety on the other hand, often refers to personal safety, and so a lot of the clothes and other accessories that we wear to protect us from danger use this word.

> 3)they're basically designed to make sure that you are you.It's just kind of the way we pair the two words. It has to be security and not safety. this happens a lot, sometimes we will say security, sometimes we will say safety.

- 1. I forgot my security card at home, so the guards wouldn't let me into the building.

- 2. Yesterday, the two countries signed a cyber security agreement.

- 3. My wife insisted that we install security cameras after our neighbors were robbed last week.

# 2.text alert/SMS [n.短信提醒]
> a text alert is basically alert in the form of a text message.SMS. Do people say that?The phone company does.In any case, this is the thing that is coming to your phone that says, you know, alert, alert. Did you do this? So this alert is about a purchase made on her credit card.

# 3.purchase & buy & purchasers 
> 1)So purchase is just a a fancy word for buy.Or if you're talking about the noun form. It's what you bought.So, for example, like you can purchase something online. I would say that a lot of times this word it's going to be used for probably pricier items.More expensive stuff. Like maybe luxury items. if you were at that luxury store, they will probably say, can I help you with your purchase?Would you like to add anything else to your purchase?

> 2)if you go to the grocery store, you're not gonna say I'm going to purchase some broccoli. I'm gonna go buy some broccoli.

> 3)purchasers:they are the people who are buying stuff.

# 4.assist & help
> assist is a fancier way of saying help.A fancier and more formal way, It's fine. But generally speaking, it's just a little bit fancier.A lot of customer service representatives will use assist.

# 5.verification /ˌvɛrɪfɪ'keʃən/ [n.] process & verified [v.核实] & unverified & unauthorized /ʌn'ɔθəraɪzd/ [adj.未经授权的].
> 1)verification process:If you want to eat, if you want to buy a phone number, if you want to use certain APPs, you always have to go through this real name verification process.To make sure that you're you,they are verifying that I am me. in the process is called a verification process or process.

> 2) unverified:If it is fake or if if it just might be fake,We often say this is unverified. it has not been proven to be true or the real thing.

> 3)So basically, from a credit card point of view, this just means charges or purchases that you did not make, you didn't say, were okay.they were made without your approval or permission. if you sign your name, sometimes just sign your name, sometimes you don't have to sign your name. But all of these things are giving authorization. When you don't give authorization, however the credit card company defines authorization. It's unauthorized.

# 6.latest [adj.最新的、最近的] & last
> 1)So latest.actually sometimes they could be the same, Like the last one could also be the most recent, like the last coffee I drank was two minutes ago.If we said the latest coffee you have. It sounds a little weird.A latest coffee. That sounds more like the newest.The newest like the Starbucks always has new latest flavor.

> 2)So basically because it is the most recent charge we use latest instead of last.

# 7.charge [v.充电、收费]
> 1)this word charge here, like that makes me think of charging my phone or charging my computer or something.

> 2)Here charge is a more formal term for a purchase or, you know, a price of something.It's kind of like like my parents used to call their credit cards, charge cards.like a lot of these are, the language is a little a little bit out of date. But but we still use it sometimes.Specifically when we're talking about the purchase with the card.

> 3)A lot of times people will even say, just charged my card.Charge it to my account.

# 8.deactivate /di'æktə,vet/ [v.使无效] & activate /'æktə'vet/ [vt.使活动]
> 1)So deactivate is just kind of like turn off. Make sure that it no longer works. when you get your credit card information stolen. Really the only thing you should be thinking about is deactivate.

> 2) the opposite of that is of course activate. So when you get your credit card for the first time, you always have to call and get them to activate it.

# 9. invalid/inactive [adj.无效的,失效的] & invalidate /ɪn'vælɪdet/ [v.使无效] & validate/'vælɪdet/ [vt.确认;使生效] 
> 1)So invalid, it is no longer able to be used.We could also say it's inactive. Even in the sense it's from a legal point of view, it's not legally binding.a contract is invalid.

> 2)And you could even invalidate a contract or any important document if you put the wrong information.When either or put the wrong date or something like that will often invalidates this, so it just can't be used.

> 3)So validate would basically be the opposite of invalidate, but there's another meaning that kind of is along the lines of recognize someone as worthy or something as worthy.if your boss praises your hard work that might make you feel very validated.In any case, the credit card company is probably not likely to validate you.In that sense of the word.

# 10.issued sb with sth/issue a card
> 1) It's a little bit more of a formal term.He says that we will issue you a new card within the next ten business days. Another word that credit card companies always use. They never say give you a card.Or supply you, send you, it's always issue you, issue you with something.

> 2)when I think of issue, I think of the army. In the army, they will issue things to people. If you're not in the army, maybe maybe your job, maybe at your job, you have to wear uniform.That will be issued by the company. It's always stuff like that. Usually a company or a big organization is giving this to you. Or letting you use it more more specifically.

# 11.be liable for sth [adj.有法律责任的] & be liable/likely to do sth & liability 
> 1)the word liable itself, It's pretty much always followed by for, Liable for something.be liable for sth:You are responsible for,from a legal point of view, like you are by law you are responsible for. 

> 2)other meaning of liable which is likely.So we would say you're liable to do something. this is quite a formal term. Most of us would just say likely to.Like for example, my parents didn't want me to play with guns, because I will I would be liable to hurt myself.

> 3) liability is the noun. for example, if you guys drive a car and if you have insurance, insurance companies will always tell you never admit liability.Even if you you were the one that crashed the car.Do not say and never admit you are liable for that.You let the insurance companies settle that out.
