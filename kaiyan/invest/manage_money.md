# II.Where should I invest money?
> Figuring out how to invest money can be a real challenge. When deciding where you should invest your money, you've got plenty of options. These options include:

# 1.The stock market & marketing
> 1)The stock market. so of course, this is where you buy stocks or shares of companies. There's really no big difference. If you own stocks, then you own shares. you own a part of the company. The market is where you go. Just like a real market. You go to trade, to buy, or to sell.When you buy a stock, you will then own a small portion of the company you bought into. When the company profits, they may pay you a portion of those profits in dividends based on how many shares of stock you own.

> 2) “market ”the activity or the job,try not to confuse the word "market" for "marketing," marketing is about advertising.it's a different thing, so we never really say "stock marketing." that's not even a thing. 

> 3) Connor and I are not financial advisors. We should be very clear about that upfront. A lot of people say that holding individual stocks [个股] is not a good idea, because it exposes you to danger.

# 2.Investment bonds
> When you purchase a bond, you are essentially loaning money to either a company or the government. The government or company selling you the bond will then pay you interest on the "loan" over the duration of the bond's lifecycle.

# 3.Mutual funds
> Rather than buying a single stock, mutual funds enable you to buy a basket of stocks in one purchase.This is when your financial adviser or some expert takes your money and invests it in a lot of different companies.we should say that mutual funds, most mutual funds invest heavily in the stock market. You don't own only one company. You own many companies. Often these funds have pretty high fee.# 4. Savings accounts
> The least risky way to invest your money is to put it in a savings account and allow it to collect interest. However, as is usually the case, low risk means low returns. 

# 5.Physical commodities
> Physical commodities are investments that you physically own, such as gold or silver. These physical commodities often serve as a safeguard against hard economic times.

# 6.bonds [n.债券]
> bonds," this idea is much older. This is basically an idea of I'm going to pay you now and you are going to give me a set price at some time in the future. the key difference here is with the bond you don't own any part of the company.you own a promise. The promise is that they are going to pay you back. Again it's set in stone, right at the beginning, this much, at that time.

# 7.real estate [n.房地产] & realtor/real estate agents.
> 1)Real estate, of course, are things that you can touch, like buildings.land,property,house and apartment. so those are all examples of real estate. 

> 2)A person who works in the real estate industry is... Well, they're called a realtor.

# 8.VC/ venture capital
> the VC stage of funding, the venture capital. These guys are the multi-billionaires. They have so much money that doesn't really matter. They can just put a little bit of money into new companies. If one turns into Uber...Amazing. And if one doesn't turn into Uber, man, no problem!

# III.grammar
# 1.comes down to
> 1)When we express the most influential factor [是最重要的影响因素] in a situation or decision. For example, if money affects our decision to buy a computer the most, we can express that like this: “My choice of computer comes down to how much money I have.”

> 2)When we describe something in the simplest way. For example, when giving an explanation for a problem, we use this phrase to give the most basic explanation: “The problem comes down to a lack of communication.”

- 1. I'd love to stay at the Ritz-Carlton, but where I'll stay comes down to how much I can afford.

- 2. I'm not sure whether we'll go skiing or not. It all comes down to the weather.

- 3. The reason they divorced came down to the differences that they couldn't resolve.

# 2.so as (not) to/in order to
> 1)the phrase "so as to" is another way to say "in order to." or "this is the purpose." These are both ways to express purpose.so you can use this phrase so as to impress your friends.

> 2)so as not to is just to make it negative, something you don't want to do.so as not to anger the bears, I stay away from the bears. Or I always come home early so as not to anger my wife.

> 3)Remember that you can also say "so as not to." Both "so as to" and "so as not to" are always followed by the infinitive /ɪn'fɪnətɪv/ [n. (动词)不定式] form of the verb.

- 1. I sometimes sleep on the couch so as not to wake up my wife. 

- 2. She goes for a run every morning so as to keep fit.  

- 3. We took off our shoes so as to avoid getting the new carpet dirty.

# 3.put away savings [phr.存钱] builds interest [phr.获得利息]
> 1)put away is kind of a similar idea like when your teacher tells you to put away your phone in class. You put it somewhere safe, you're gonna use it later.

> 2)So interest is just that small percentage of money that you get, that you gain when you keep your money in an account in like a bank or an investment.The point is it doesn't matter if it's a low-risk investment, a medium risk or a high-risk one. They're all going to build a certain amount of interest.

# 4.appetite & appetite for sth [n.偏好] & high/low-risk & high/low-reward & shift into/to 
> 1)an appetite for something just means what you desire.

> 2) Facebook, or Google, and all of these massive companies that these early investors got such a high reward from. I would say that would be something like a certain kind of stocks.Now one thing about high-risk, high-reward. It's okay when you're young because if you lose it all you have time to get it back.

> 3)hese're all kinds of investment, they're low-risk, meaning it's safe.a low-risk investment. It will build interest but it won't build as much interest.so in a savings account you will build interest but it's probably like 2%, the most.And even that, even that now it's not 2%.

> 4)when you're driving a car, the difference between first gear and second gear is not big. So shifting from first gear into second gear is not like a crazy different thing.Or at your job, maybe you don't quit your job, but maybe you can shift into a different position.so we often say "shift into." You'll also hear "shift to."So here we're talking about shifting into low-risk investments.

# 5.wants [n.想要的东西] & necessities [n.必需品] & essentials [n.& adj.必需品、必须做的事]
> 1）"wants"this is not a verb, this is a noun.you could say like, "Well, I want to buy a new TV but it's just a want."

> 2)necessity as you might guess means something that you need.It's necessary or it's needed. Now, living in a big city having a car isn't really a necessity.and the plural is "necessities".

> 3)"essential" here is a noun, we often use it as an adjective, essential things, that's what this means. The essential things, the basic things, we even say the basics.

> 4）"essential" does have that meaning of basic, but also necessary,Like you can't have an event without food, you can't have an event without... Well I guess you could have it without food, people wouldn't be happy; but you couldn't have an event without a venue or staff.like if we're thinking about say, a car for example, the essentials on a car are the wheels, the engine.The steering /'stɪrɪŋ/ wheel. But everything else is just an accessory /ək'sɛsəri/ [n.配件]. like the Bluetooth stereo /ˈstɛriˌo/.The leather seats. You don't need to have those in order to have a car.

# 6.checking account [n.支票账户] & savings account [n.存款账户]
> 1)if you have insufficient funds, then you probably need to check the balance on your checking account.So, balance, of course, is how much money is left. And the checking account, it's a type of bank account that you use a lot for buying things.the checking account is the one that you use for day-to-day banking.

> 2)so usually you have two types of accounts, you have your checking account and your savings account. So the savings account is for saving money.you put the money, you want to save for when you retire and go live on the beach.

# 7.budget [v.做预算] & planning ahead [phr.提前规划]
> 1)I usually try to budget, especially when I am traveling. So maybe on my next trip, I will budget, maybe two thousand or three thousand dollars.

> 2)you can budget for emergencies. You might want to have that extra money on the side, in case anything happens.

> 3)you can even budget your time, So in that case, you are careful with your time and you, I guess, plan how much time to spend on everything.you kind of managing your time.

> 4) it's all part of planning ahead for your future.It's kind of like when you, you expect something in the future or you're just planning in case it happens.

# 8.splurge on sth  /splɝdʒ/ [n.挥霍] & be (not) live within your means [phr.量入为出]
> 1)So splurge is like when you spend a lot of money on something.And it can be splurging on something useful but often it's just splurging on something kind of fun,and sort of more than you really need.More than you need and also importantly more than you can afford.Some of us can never afford to splurge too much.

> 2)This is another phrase often used when we talk about managing money and and within your means just means, you know, don't spend more money than you make or you have.

> 3)we don't say live without your means. We just say he's not living within his means.It's kind of a formal expression but it's pretty important.It's good financial advice.It doesn't matter how much money, I mean, if you are a really rich guy.But you spend money as if you were a richer guy, you're not living within your means.

# 9.mortgage /'mɔrɡɪdʒ/ [n.按揭] & payments [n.付款] & add up (to) [phr.累积]
> 1）mortgage is a special kind of loan from the bank,and it's really only for a house,we don't use it for school,it really is only for that house,the day you take out a mortgage, it may be a happy day, but you have a long road ahead of paying down that mortgage.the day you take out a mortgage, it may be a happy day, but you have a long road ahead of paying down that mortgage.

> 2)So "add up" is just when you want to calculate the total of something.We use this a lot at the restaurant. When we're looking at the bill, what do our meals add up to?Exactly. In fact, I mean you could even get rid of the "to".You could just say like something adds up, like "Oh, all of those coffees every day."

# 10.put in my two cents [phr.发表我的观点] & make your money work for you [phr.让你的钱为你工作] & it's a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step [phr.千里之行始于足下] 
> 1)here's a great phrase. Well, it's not really related to money at all.It's about giving advice.and you usually say it just like this, "If I can put in my two cents..." it's a little more polite that way actually.

> 2) It sounds like a slogan.When you're not using your money it should be building itself basically.Because it does kind of have to work, it has to search out...you know, like places to go, ways that it can borrow itself out or lend itself out. And it's working.

> 3) If you are not so diligent about managing money, you know, it's a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step,That's kind of the hardest thing to do, is to actually look at your expenses to see how they add up and start to, you know, just basically build your savings. it's easier said than done but you won't regret it.

# 11.balance your portfolio [n.投资组合] & artist's portfolio [n.画家作品集]
> 1)so "portfolio" to me is like what businessmen carry that little folder thing.To carry all their paperwork.All the papers and stuff like that. 

> 2)But for investments, it's a little different.originally, the investors would have had their shares.In there you carry your shares around. Nowadays, nobody really gets physical shares. You have the right to them but it's probably all done through computers. 

> 3)I do think about artists though. An artist's portfolio is a similar idea. They would carry around their pictures or their drawings to show to galleries or to show to art schools.

> 4)"Keep some high-risk ones so as to balance your portfolio." this idea of radically changing something, changing it completely. If you go from having all these really high-risk, high-reward things to having low-risk, low-reward, you're going to find that you're not going to make as much money. You still want to make a little bit of money.or your kids need to go to college, whatever happens, as you get older. The key here is that you want to "balance your portfolio."

# 12.don’t put all of your eggs into one basket & "nest egg" 
> 1)So eggs are important. They're precious, but they can break easily.so you don't want to keep them all in one place, because what if they all break at the same time. You have no eggs.you have to spread them out into many baskets so that if one breaks, it's okay. I've got these other ones, and one of those might be your nest egg.

> 2) "nest egg" is another phrase and it's kind of the big investment that you have for when you retire, when you get older.You can think about the nest here as being your home. And the egg that is inside is the most valuable thing, the thing that you are protecting above all else, at all cost.So it's usually a home.

# IV.pattern
***Hey Peter, did you do any shopping over Chinese New Year?***
