It could be both public stock [公共股票] or those traded privately [私下交易]. It started in 12th-century France, where financial people [金融人员] were concerned with regulating the debts of agricultural [代表银行关注农业债的管理] communities on behalf of the banks. By the middle of the 13th century, bankers in Venice, Italy, began to trade in government securities.[政府证券]

> The first official join-stock [加入股市] company to get a fixed capital [固定资本] stock was the Dutch East India Company [荷兰东印度公司], which was founded in 1602.

# III.ways of invest 
# 1.stock market/marketing & share & checking stock prices & play the stock market [phr.炒股]
> 1)The stock market is where you buy stocks or shares of companies. There's really no big difference. If you own stocks, then you own shares. you own a part of the company. The market is where you go. Just like a real market. You go to trade, to buy, or to sell.When you buy a stock, you will then own a small portion of the company you bought into. When the company profits, they may pay you a portion of those profits in dividends based on how many shares of stock you own. lot of people say that holding individual stocks [个股] is not a good idea, because it exposes you to danger.

> 2)stock represents a piece or a portion of ownership in a company.

> 3)a share is more specific.So we don't say share market but stock market because it's general. if you want to say I have some stocks in like Apple or Microsoft, you say "I have shares" usually.so you could say I have stocks in Apple.But you would say: "I have a hundred shares".

> 4)checking stock prices:you have to watch them like a hawk.

> 5)so this is not like a sport, although it kinda like a game, Because it's going up and down and is changing all the time, like you play poker, there is the risk involved, so we use that verb here with stock market, "you're playing the stock market" means investing, selling, buying...It's like gambling.so we generally only use this for a stock market, like you don't use it for real estate market.you can say "I'd invest in the real estate market",

# 2.bonds
> 1)When you purchase a bond, you are essentially loaning money to either a company or the government. The government or company selling you the bond will then pay you interest on the "loan" over the duration of the bond's lifecycle.

> 2)a bond is basically usually with the government and it's like a certificate of money, that you are lending the government your money. So it kind of goes into a big government bank account that generates a lot of interest. And then after a fixed term, so usually five years or ten years, you are allowed to get your money back. And the risk with these are kind of moderates, because the government doesn't want to lose its money.But it's basically, you're lending money to the government for a fixed period of time.

# 3.Mutual funds & to fund sth 
> 1)Rather than buying a single stock, mutual funds enable you to buy a basket of stocks in one purchase.This is when your financial adviser or some expert takes your money and invests it in a lot of different companies.we should say that mutual funds, it's kind of an investment where someone or many people will put money into the same fund and buy shares and stocks together.most mutual funds invest heavily in the stock market. You don't own only one company. You own many companies. Often these funds have pretty high fee.# 4. Savings accounts

> 2) a fund is like a sum or amount of money that you're saving for a purpose, which is also, is related but different than the verb, it can be a verb as well.

> 3)to fund sth means to pay for sth,support sth.

# 5.Physical commodities
> Physical commodities are investments that you physically own, such as gold or silver. These physical commodities often serve as a safeguard against hard economic times.

# 6.bonds [n.债券]
> 1)this is basically an idea of I'm going to pay you now and you are going to give me a set price at some time in the future. the key difference here is with the bond you don't own any part of the company.you own a promise. The promise is that they are going to pay you back. 

> 2)a bond is basically usually with the government and it's like a certificate of money, that you are lending the government your money. So it kind of goes into a big government bank account that generates a lot of interest. And then after a fixed term, so usually five years or ten years, you are allowed to get your money back. And the risk with these are kind of moderates, because the government doesn't want to lose its money.

## 1) high yield bonds & trash bonds & a higher yield trash bonds 
> 1)sth is high yield means that you're getting a lot from it.

> 2)a trash bonds is a very risky bond,it means that the seller might not pay you back because you know he's still trying to get all the money.

> 3)a higher yield trash bond means that you might make a lot of money from this bonds,it's very dependable.

# 7.property/real estate [n.房地产] & property [n.财产] & real estate agents/realtor /ˈriəltɚ/ /realetor
> 1)Real estate are things that you can touch, like buildings.land,property,house and apartment. so those are all examples of real estate. we're talking about real estate, essentially like a condo, a house, some sort of physical thing that you live in. real estate, so this is basically the whole major category of buying and selling property, and owing property.so it's like property but this is more specific to land or buildings.

> 2)But property, you can use any, like object, it can even be like a ring or necklace.Anything that belongs to you.something real tangible asset, something that's real.So you may see this if you go to a train station, for example, there may be a sign saying "Lost Property Office". So someone has lost their stuff.and you could even say: "Oh, this's mine. " You could say: "This is my property."

> 3)and the person who helps you buy and sell would be a real estate agent.A person who works in the real estate industry is called a realtor.in some places they call "realtor", even in America some places they say realetor. It's really funny.

> 4)the verb we normally used for real estate - quick turnover is flipping.like if you buy a house, a cheap house.And then fix it up.and usually in a short period of time, so same concept to start stock market - You usually buy and sell for short periods of time, and for real estate, it's the same. But we call it flipping instead.

# 8.VC/ venture capital
> the VC stage of funding, the venture capital. These guys are the multi-billionaires. They have so much money that doesn't really matter. They can just put a little bit of money into new companies. If one turns into Uber...Amazing. And if one doesn't turn into Uber, man, no problem!

# 9.RRSP/registered retirement savings plan on programs
> in the U.S, people mostly invest through things like retirement programs instead of directly investing. So like RRSP.that's a way to save your money for when you get old.and they're tax-free so you get a tax credit at the end of the year.So even though it's not investing in a company, you're still investing in your future.

# 10.savings account [n.存款账户] & checking account [n.支票账户] & put away savings [phr.存钱] builds interest [phr.获得利息]
> 1)so usually you have two types of accounts, you have your checking account and your savings account.the checking account is a type of bank account that you use a lot for buying things.the checking account is the one that you use for day-to-day banking.if you have insufficient funds, then you probably need to check the balance on your checking account.

> 2)the money you make we call it interest. And savings accounts, they're so safe that there is low interest. And if something with… their less safe, there's a higher interest rate usually. So the savings account is for saving money.you put the money, you want to save for when you retire and go live on the beach.

> 3)put away is kind of a similar idea like when your teacher tells you to put away your phone in class. You put it somewhere safe, you're gonna use it later.

> 4)So interest is just that small percentage of money that you get, that you gain when you keep your money in an account in like a bank or an investment.The point is it doesn't matter if it's a low-risk investment, a medium risk or a high-risk one. They're all going to build a certain amount of interest.

# 11.debts & credit card debt & student debt & Disposable income/money
> 1)so debt is moneythat you owe to anybody, even if I do somebody a favor, if I help someone, we say: "Oh, thank you. I'm in your debt."if you need to help move or something like that.

> 2)So like common, the most common types of debt, well probably credit card debt is the worst.It's the biggest and the worst.

> 3)student debt.So the government gave me money so I could study in university, now I have to pay them back.with a decent interest rate.it's a low interest rate. So this is a huge problem in the USA right now, Canada is a little bit safer.We have kind of government subsidized debts, student loans, But in the USA, it's the largest portion of student debt, because the interest rates are really high.the whole problem with this is when you are just trying to pay your bills, and you're not making that much more money or disposable income, you can't really put any money aside for your future.

> 4)Disposable income or money that I make that I can use for something different.For play time, yes. So the students, they graduate, they have to pay the money, but they can't. They're stuck.so there's no hope in planning for your future. It's living in the here and now you're just surviving.

# 12.mortgage /'mɔrɡɪdʒ/ [n.按揭] & payments [n.付款] & add up (to) [phr.累积]
> 1）mortgage is a special kind of loan from the bank,and it's really only for a house,we don't use it for school,it really is only for that house,the day you take out a mortgage, it may be a happy day, but you have a long road ahead of paying down that mortgage.the day you take out a mortgage, it may be a happy day, but you have a long road ahead of paying down that mortgage.

> 2)So "add up" is just when you want to calculate the total of something.We use this a lot at the restaurant. When we're looking at the bill, what do our meals add up to?Exactly. In fact, I mean you could even get rid of the "to".You could just say like something adds up, like "Oh, all of those coffees every day."

# 13.fintech [n.金融科技] & bitcoin & angel financing & Wechat wallet & Alipay 
> 1)financial technology,so tech companies basically.Fintech is the one you want to remember if you're interested in exploring the new ways of investing.New technologies. And the great thing is, with these you can often invest on your mobile phone, it's very very convenient.

> 2)any kind of technology used for finance or financial purposes like peer-to-peer lending, or P2P lending. Bitcoins, a big one. maybe even sometimes, angel financing, you're coming to play here.

> 3)bitcoin:it's basically online money,It's like an open source, it's independent, not owned by anyone. It's just like a new form of money, it's all on the internet.so there's actually Bitcoin machine, so I put in my bank card or cash, and I get a Bitcoin but I just got a piece of paper that says: "I have a Bitcoin."So there's no physical money in my hands, it's all online.

# IV.grammar
# 1.comes down to
> 1)When we express the most influential factor [是最重要的影响因素] in a situation or decision. For example, if money affects our decision to buy a computer the most, we can express that like this: “My choice of computer comes down to how much money I have.”

> 2)When we describe something in the simplest way. For example, when giving an explanation for a problem, we use this phrase to give the most basic explanation: “The problem comes down to a lack of communication.”

> 2)so as not to is just to make it negative, something you don't want to do.so as not to anger the bears, I stay away from the bears. Or I always come home early so as not to anger my wife.

- 1. I sometimes sleep on the couch so as not to wake up my wife.

# 3.return related
## 1）the return on your investment & Ponzi/pyramid /'pɪrəmɪd/ schemes 
> 1)"the return on your investment", means the money you get back.it's used as a noun here. So you put like $20,000 in, if the business is successful, you're gonna get more than $20,000 back.sometimes that promise of a high return can be too good to be true.sounds so good that's because it's not true, it's fake.People like to exaggerate how much return other investors will get sometimes.

> 2)Ponzi schemes，named after Charles Ponzi who died in 1949. And he did one of these schemes, he created it.basically the idea is that you're promising lots of success, you're promising it like instant-soon financial success, but it's really not that.

> 3)a scheme is used for a plan, but it's kind of tricky, maybe not so honest.It's often used in negative way like a bad thing, like a trick.So if a person, like a thief is planning something, they are schemer or they're scheming.

## 3）lucrative /'lukrətɪv/ [adj.盈利好的，能赚钱的] & a lucrative job/career/deal/business

## 4）made a killing in/of sth [phr.赚大钱]
> 1)so basically you are making a lot of money of investments, then we could say make a killing.it's just made a lot of money,they are very successful in a very short time. Pretty lucky, but also you got to be smart to make a killing. So like obviously, Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook, he made a killing of his Facebook.

> 2) we can use "in", make a killing in real estate or you can say make a killing "of", of something.

# 4.appetite & appetite for sth [n.偏好] 
## 1)high/low-risk & high/low-reward 
> 1)an appetite for something just means what you desire.

> 2) Facebook, or Google, and all of these massive companies that these early investors got such a high reward from. I would say that would be something like a certain kind of stocks.Now one thing about high-risk, high-reward. It's okay when you're young because if you lose it all you have time to get it back.

> 3)hese're all kinds of investment, they're low-risk, meaning it's safe.a low-risk investment. It will build interest but it won't build as much interest.so in a savings account you will build interest but it's probably like 2%, the most.And even that, even that now it's not 2%.

## 2)risk-averse [adj.风险规避] & be averse to sth 
> And so these are the two terms that when you're investing, these are the two types of investors usually.So these are some of the terms that people use in finance and stock market investing.if you're averse to something, you don't like it. For example, I am averse to spiders. if someone is risk-averse, they don't like taking chances with their money.they don't like gambling too much. They want something safe.

## 4)shift into/to 
> 4)when you're driving a car, the difference between first gear and second gear is not big. So shifting from first gear into second gear is not like a crazy different thing.Or at your job, maybe you don't quit your job, but maybe you can shift into a different position.so we often say "shift into." You'll also hear "shift to."So here we're talking about shifting into low-risk investments.

## 5)muddle up [phr.迷糊，不清楚]
> so if you're muddled, it means there's too much going on in your brain.so with Bitcoin, it confuses him, just like the stock market muddles me up.

# 5.wants [n.想要的东西] & necessities [n.必需品] & essentials [n.& adj.必需品、必须做的事]
> 1）"wants"this is not a verb, this is a noun.you could say like, "Well, I want to buy a new TV but it's just a want."

> 2)necessity as you might guess means something that you need.It's necessary or it's needed. Now, living in a big city having a car isn't really a necessity.and the plural is "necessities".

> 3)"essential" here is a noun, we often use it as an adjective, essential things, that's what this means. The essential things, the basic things, we even say the basics.

> 4）"essential" does have that meaning of basic, but also necessary,Like you can't have an event without food, you can't have an event without... Well I guess you could have it without food, people wouldn't be happy; but you couldn't have an event without a venue or staff.like if we're thinking about say, a car for example, the essentials on a car are the wheels, the engine.The steering /'stɪrɪŋ/ wheel. But everything else is just an accessory /ək'sɛsəri/ [n.配件]. like the Bluetooth stereo /ˈstɛriˌo/.The leather seats. You don't need to have those in order to have a car.

# 6.market & marketing
> “market ”the activity or the job,try not to confuse the word "market" for "marketing," marketing is about advertising.it's a different thing, so we never really say "stock marketing." that's not even a thing. 

## 1）bull/bear  market  [n.牛/熊市]
> 1)so the bull market would be a market that is going very rapidly,that's very strong.

> 2)the market slows down would be a bear market.

## 2）emerging market
> so it's almost like new or growing markets,we're talking about places in the world that aren't established,they're not old and dependable,they're new and exciting.

# 7.budget [v.做预算] & planning ahead [phr.提前规划]

# 8.splurge on sth  /splɝdʒ/ [n.挥霍] & be (not) live within your means [phr.量入为出]
> 1)So splurge is like when you spend a lot of money on something.And it can be splurging on something useful but often it's just splurging on something kind of fun,and sort of more than you really need.More than you need and also importantly more than you can afford.Some of us can never afford to splurge too much.

> 2)This is another phrase often used when we talk about managing money and and within your means just means, you know, don't spend more money than you make or you have.

> 3)we don't say live without your means. We just say he's not living within his means.It's kind of a formal expression but it's pretty important.It's good financial advice.It doesn't matter how much money, I mean, if you are a really rich guy.But you spend money as if you were a richer guy, you're not living within your means.

# 9.don’t put all of your eggs into one basket & "nest egg" 
> 1)So eggs are important. They're precious, but they can break easily.so you don't want to keep them all in one place, because what if they all break at the same time. You have no eggs.you have to spread them out into many baskets so that if one breaks, it's okay. I've got these other ones, and one of those might be your nest egg.

> 2) "nest egg" is another phrase and it's kind of the big investment that you have for when you retire, when you get older.You can think about the nest here as being your home. And the egg that is inside is the most valuable thing, the thing that you are protecting above all else, at all cost.So it's usually a home.

# 10.put in my two cents [phr.发表我的观点] & make your money work for you [phr.让你的钱为你工作] & it's a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step [phr.千里之行始于足下] 
> 1)here's a great phrase. Well, it's not really related to money at all.It's about giving advice.and you usually say it just like this, "If I can put in my two cents..." it's a little more polite that way actually.

> 2) It sounds like a slogan.When you're not using your money it should be building itself basically.Because it does kind of have to work, it has to search out...you know, like places to go, ways that it can borrow itself out or lend itself out. And it's working.

> 3) If you are not so diligent about managing money, you know, it's a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step,That's kind of the hardest thing to do, is to actually look at your expenses to see how they add up and start to, you know, just basically build your savings. it's easier said than done but you won't regret it.

# 11.balance your portfolio [n.投资组合] & artist's portfolio [n.画家作品集]
> 1)so "portfolio" to me is like what businessmen carry that little folder thing.To carry all their paperwork.All the papers and stuff like that. 

> 2)But for investments, it's a little different.originally, the investors would have had their shares.In there you carry your shares around. Nowadays, nobody really gets physical shares. You have the right to them but it's probably all done through computers. 

> 3)I do think about artists though. An artist's portfolio is a similar idea. They would carry around their pictures or their drawings to show to galleries or to show to art schools.

> 4)"Keep some high-risk ones so as to balance your portfolio." this idea of radically changing something, changing it completely. If you go from having all these really high-risk, high-reward things to having low-risk, low-reward, you're going to find that you're not going to make as much money. You still want to make a little bit of money.or your kids need to go to college, whatever happens, as you get older. The key here is that you want to "balance your portfolio."

# 12.crackdown [n.强制取缔] & drug trafficking /'træfɪk/ [n.非法交易]
> so if there's a problem with something, then government will often create new laws, for the police to enforce.so this could be like drug trafficking.so if that's increasing, there's a crackdown on drug traffickers, meaning that's where the law enforcement is focusing their attention

# 13.liquidity /lɪˈkwɪdəti/ [n.流动资金]
> we heared all about liquidity in the finance.maybe in your company the accountant will talk about this,it's basically just to have money,cash in hand.

***Hey Peter, did you do any shopping over Chinese New Year?***

***Yeah, I got a few small things for my family, but I can never afford to splurge too much. my mortgage payments add up to about a third of my income. And on top of that, I need to save for my kids' education.***

***Oh, wow. I've never been that diligent with managing money. That must be hard to have anything leftover for your own wants.***

***It is, but they're necessities. I know I won't regret it later. Do you have any investments?***

***I just put away money every month into my savings.***

***Oh, really? If I can put in my two cents, I would put some of that into a low-risk investment that builds interest instead of letting it sit in savings.***

***Hmm, that's a good point. I should really start being smarter about my money.***

***Yeah, make your money work for you. Planning ahead for your future will help you live within your means.***

***Thanks, Peter. That really helps.***

*** Hey Warren, do you mind if I ask you how you invest?***

***Not at all! I invest in a little bit of everything: mutual funds, bonds, real estate.***

***Do you invest in the stock market?***

***I don't hold individual stocks, no. But I'm exposed to the market through various funds.***

***I'm having trouble getting started. I can't figure out what my appetite for risk is.***

***You're young, you should probably have more high-risk, high-reward investments.***

***Then when I get older I should shift into safer low-risk investments?***

***It seems many Chinese play the stock market. In the US, we mostly invest through things like retirement programs instead of directly investing.***

***Well, I’d love it if someone who knows what they’re doing could do it for me. I’m very risk-averse, but at the same time, I don’t want to just let my money depreciate in a savings account.***

***Yeah, I know what you mean. My parents’ generation would invest in bonds or mutual funds, but my generation has massive debts that make it hard to invest in anything.***

***It’s becoming similar here in China. My parents’ generation was obsessed with saving for their children, whether it was cash or property.***

***Yeah, I heard a lot of Chinese made a killing in real estate, both in China and abroad. It’s very lucrative.***

***That’s true, but there are a lot of restrictions in real estate investment, so many people are turning to fintech.***

***Well, the stock market just took a huge plunge and we've lost a lot of money!***

***What do you mean? What happened?***

***There are many factors that weigh in, but NASDAQ is down 200 points and the Dow Jones indicator also suffered! Our portfolio is worth half of what it was worth one week ago.***

***How is this possible? You are supposed to be talking to our stockbrokers and making sure that our securities and investments are safe and making a profitable return!***

***I know sir! We didn't expect a bull market to become a bear market all of a sudden. On the other hand,you still have some high yield trash bonds and government bonds that will give us enough liquidity to cut our losses and reinvest in emerging markets. We could potentially make this tragedy work for us and make us think outside the box.***

***Do what you have to do! One other thing, don't tell the rest of the stockholders about this. If they find out,it's the end of this company!***
