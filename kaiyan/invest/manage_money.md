***Hey Peter, did you do any shopping over Chinese New Year?***

***Yeah, I got a few small things for my family, but I can never afford to splurge too much. my mortgage payments add up to about a third of my income. And on top of that, I need to save for my kids' education.***

***Oh, wow. I've never been that diligent with managing money. That must be hard to have anything leftover for your own wants.***

***It is, but they're necessities. I know I won't regret it later. Do you have any investments?***

***I just put away money every month into my savings.***

***Oh, really? If I can put in my two cents, I would put some of that into a low-risk investment that builds interest instead of letting it sit in savings.***

***Hmm, that's a good point. I should really start being smarter about my money.***

***Yeah, make your money work for you. Planning ahead for your future will help you live within your means.***

***Thanks, Peter. That really helps.***
