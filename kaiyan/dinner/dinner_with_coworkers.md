# I.Perfect food-and-beer pairings
> It's no secret that Americans love beer, which, especially for casual dining, can serve as a great match for food. Here are some perfect beer and food pairings recommended by some experts.

# 1.Cheese, sandwiches, pizza
> Wine may cover up some of the flavors in cheese while the carbonation /ˌkɑːbə'neɪʃən/ [碳酸化作用] in beer creates a lighter acidity /ə'sɪdəti/ [酸] and lifts the fats in the cheese off the palate[消解芝士的油腻口感]. Whether it’s a straight-up cheese platter[吃实打实的奶酪拼盘], pizza, sandwich or salad, almost any beer is a go when it comes to cheese.

# 2.Chicken, seafood, pasta
> Lighter is better[口味越淡越好]. A light German lager[清淡的德国拉格啤酒] or Belgian Saison[比利时赛森啤酒] with chicken or fish is perfect. (If creams or sauces are added, you need a heavy, richer beer[味道更浓重].) Pasta /'pɑstə/ is slightly more versatile /'vɝsətl/ [意大利面口味多样] but still pairs well with similar brews[清淡口味的啤酒] like blonde ales [金黄艾尔] and German or American wheat ales[德国或美国产小麦啤酒].

# 3.French fries and fried foods 
> French fries, an American staple cuisine /kwɪˈzin/ [美式主食], are light in flavor profile /'profaɪl/ , so opt for a brew that will help cleanse the palate without washing away the taste of the food[选择既能清爽口腔但是又不冲淡食物口味的啤酒]. The recommendation that goes for most fried, salty dishes includes light German lagers[德国拉格啤酒] and Samuel Adams Octoberfest[山姆·亚当斯的十月啤酒节啤酒].

# II.Office Lunch Idea: Brown-bagging [自带午饭]
> In today's dialogue, our co-workers are all trying to decide where to go to eat. Of course, if your office is in a very expensive downtown location[昂贵的中心地段], not all workers will be able to afford to buy their food everyday. So many office workers "brown bag it": they pack their sandwiches, fruits, cookies, etc. all into a brown bag, and bring it to work with them. If the office has a lunchroom [午餐室], then the brown-baggers can eat lunch together. If not, then they might have to eat by themselves at their desks.

> Now, not everyone uses an actual brown bag to bring their lunch to work. But even if you bring your lunch in a purple box, it can still be called brown bagging it. Additionally, sometimes when brown bag is said at work, it doesn't mean the food itself, but rather a kind of meeting or presentation that goes on during lunchtime [并不表示食物，而是一种在午饭时间进行的会议或者展示。]. Since these can sometimes be, shall we say, a little boring, the best way to escape them is to head to the nearby food court or cafeteria with your rich co-workers!

# III.grammar
# 1.Neither am I & neither do I & me neither 
> 1)In today’s dialogue, the speaker, Sarah, responded to Sean’s question by saying, “neither.” In this case, “neither” was used as a very casual and shortened version of “neither am I” or “me neither.”[“neither”用法非常随意， 是“neither am I”或者 “me neither”的简化形式。]

> 2)“Neither am I,” “neither do I” and “me neither” can all be used to say “me too” when you are agreeing with a negative sentence (e.g., A: I don’t like coffee. B: Me neither).[但你要对否定句表示赞同时，“neither am I,” “neither do I” 和 “me neither”这三个短语都可以使用。]

> 3)Sometimes, native speakers will use “me either” instead of “me neither.” Some may consider this to be incorrect, but it is frequently used in spoken English.[有时候母语者会说“me either”而不是“me neither”。有些人认为“me either”这种说法是错误的，但是英语口语 中经常听到这种说法.]

- A: I don't go clubbing often. B: Yeah, neither.

- A: I can't believe he's 60. B: Me neither!

- A: I really don't want to wake up at 5 a.m. tomorrow! B: Neither do I!

# 2.I could really go for [phr.真想选择/要]
> 1)So," I could really go for" this kind of means that 'I really want this,' or 'I'd be up for this.'Yeah, 'I'd like to have something.

> 2)But this "could really go for"— we don't always just use it with beer. You could say, "I could really go for some coffee," or "I could really go for a walk. I'd like to go outside." It's nice out, right?

# 3.a round [n.每人一点]
> 1)so "a round"—this is a counter, right? It's a counter for a group of things.So, basically, if you are with your friends and you go to a bar or a restaurant and everybody, you know, is going to have some beers. 

> 2)You can say "a round of beers," but we don't just use it for beers. We use it for a lot of things.Yeah, like 'a round of questions.'Or 'a round of cocktails.'Or 'a round of chicken wings.' Ooh! Yum yum!How about 'a round of applause.'We can also use it for that! Or, when we're talking about sports, 'a round of tennis'—that's like a game of tennis, right?Yeah. You could even say, 'a round of bowling'.

# 4.be down for [phr.赞同某事]
> So basically, it means 'I'd be cool with that/I'd be okay with that.

# 5.load up on [phr.多加、多点] & toppings [n.浇头]
> 1)"Load up." So this just means 'get a lot of.Okay, so you can load up on other things than just toppings, you can load up on booze.You can load up on necessities.Yeah, or maybe if you like to read, you might load up on the books when shopping.

> Basically, a lot of times we load up on things to prepare for later. If there's going to be a big snowstorm, you know. It's like "ah, go to the store and load up on food" because we won't be able to go out for a long time.

> 2)in this case, if he's loading up on the toppings, maybe he wants to add a lot of cheese and tomatoes to his nachos.I guess he's not worried about his waistline.

# 6.split [v.分开] & share & split the bill [AA制]
> Well, there are some things you can split which is to share, but there's something you can share, but it's not splitting.

> 1)when you split something, you're cutting it in half. So, for example, I'm not gonna say, "let's split the bathroom," right? I'm not cutting the bathroom in half, right? I'll say let's share the bathroom.

> 2)And parents usually say to their kids, "You need to share your toys with the other kids." But, you can't split your toys because you're just going to break them.

> 3)So splitting the bill at the end of the night—you pay fifty, I pay fifty, and we're all good.

# 7.big eater [n.大胃王]
> sometimes we also say like that you have a big appetite.'Appetite' /'æpɪtaɪt/ just means your ability to eat or not, basically.
