# I.Perfect food-and-beer pairings
> It's no secret that Americans love beer, which, especially for casual dining, can serve as a great match for food. Here are some perfect beer and food pairings recommended by some experts.

# 1.Cheese, sandwiches, pizza
> Wine may cover up some of the flavors in cheese while the carbonation /ˌkɑːbə'neɪʃən/ [碳酸化作用] in beer creates a lighter acidity /ə'sɪdəti/ [酸] and lifts the fats in the cheese off the palate[消解芝士的油腻口感]. Whether it’s a straight-up cheese platter[吃实打实的奶酪拼盘], pizza, sandwich or salad, almost any beer is a go when it comes to cheese.

# 2.Chicken, seafood, pasta
> Lighter is better[口味越淡越好]. A light German lager[清淡的德国拉格啤酒] or Belgian Saison[比利时赛森啤酒] with chicken or fish is perfect. (If creams or sauces are added, you need a heavy, richer beer[味道更浓重].) Pasta /'pɑstə/ is slightly more versatile /'vɝsətl/ [意大利面口味多样] but still pairs well with similar brews[清淡口味的啤酒] like blonde ales [金黄艾尔] and German or American wheat ales[德国或美国产小麦啤酒].

# 3.French fries and fried foods 
> French fries, an American staple cuisine /kwɪˈzin/ [美式主食], are light in flavor profile /'profaɪl/ , so opt for a brew that will help cleanse the palate without washing away the taste of the food[选择既能清爽口腔但是又不冲淡食物口味的啤酒]. The recommendation that goes for most fried, salty dishes includes light German lagers[德国拉格啤酒] and Samuel Adams Octoberfest[山姆·亚当斯的十月啤酒节啤酒].

# II.grammar
# 1.Neither am I & neither do I & me neither 
> 1)In today’s dialogue, the speaker, Sarah, responded to Sean’s question by saying, “neither.” In this case, “neither” was used as a very casual and shortened version of “neither am I” or “me neither.”[“neither”用法非常随意， 是“neither am I”或者 “me neither”的简化形式。]

> 2)“Neither am I,” “neither do I” and “me neither” can all be used to say “me too” when you are agreeing with a negative sentence (e.g., A: I don’t like coffee. B: Me neither).[但你要对否定句表示赞同时，“neither am I,” “neither do I” 和 “me neither”这三个短语都可以使用。]

> 3)Sometimes, native speakers will use “me either” instead of “me neither.” Some may consider this to be incorrect, but it is frequently used in spoken English.[有时候母语者会说“me either”而不是“me neither”。有些人认为“me either”这种说法是错误的，但是英语口语 中经常听到这种说法.]

- A: I don't go clubbing often. B: Yeah, neither.

- A: I can't believe he's 60. B: Me neither!

- A: I really don't want to wake up at 5 a.m. tomorrow! B: Neither do I!

***Man, what a long day! I could really go for a cold one.***

***Same here. Should we start with a round of beers?***

***I'd be down for that. But why don't we just order a pitcher?***

***Sure. What about the appetizers? Is anyone a vegetarian?***

***Ok. How does a salad and some nachos sound?***

***That sounds amazing. Oh, and we should definitely load up on the toppings.***

***Alright, extra cheese it is! Do you guys want to split the mains too, or each get our own?***

***I'm a big eater, so why don't we get four and share?***

***That's a ton of food. Are you sure you'll have room for dessert after that?***

***Oh, don't worry! There's always room for dessert!***
