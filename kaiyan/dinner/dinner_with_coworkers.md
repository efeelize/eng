# I.Perfect food-and-beer pairings
> It's no secret that Americans love beer, which, especially for casual dining, can serve as a great match for food. Here are some perfect beer and food pairings recommended by some experts.

# 1.Cheese, sandwiches, pizza
> Wine may cover up some of the flavors in cheese while the carbonation /ˌkɑːbə'neɪʃən/ [碳酸化作用] in beer creates a lighter acidity /ə'sɪdəti/ [酸] and lifts the fats in the cheese off the palate[消解芝士的油腻口感]. Whether it’s a straight-up cheese platter[吃实打实的奶酪拼盘], pizza, sandwich or salad, almost any beer is a go when it comes to cheese.

# 2.Chicken, seafood, pasta
> Lighter is better[口味越淡越好]. A light German lager[清淡的德国拉格啤酒] or Belgian Saison[比利时赛森啤酒] with chicken or fish is perfect. (If creams or sauces are added, you need a heavy, richer beer[味道更浓重].) Pasta /'pɑstə/ is slightly more versatile /'vɝsətl/ [意大利面口味多样] but still pairs well with similar brews[清淡口味的啤酒] like blonde ales [金黄艾尔] and German or American wheat ales[德国或美国产小麦啤酒].

# 3.French fries and fried foods 
> French fries, an American staple cuisine /kwɪˈzin/ [美式主食], are light in flavor profile /'profaɪl/ , so opt for a brew that will help cleanse the palate without washing away the taste of the food[选择既能清爽口腔但是又不冲淡食物口味的啤酒]. The recommendation that goes for most fried, salty dishes includes light German lagers[德国拉格啤酒] and Samuel Adams Octoberfest[山姆·亚当斯的十月啤酒节啤酒].

# II.Office Lunch Idea: Brown-bagging [自带午饭]
> In today's dialogue, our co-workers are all trying to decide where to go to eat. Of course, if your office is in a very expensive downtown location[昂贵的中心地段], not all workers will be able to afford to buy their food everyday. So many office workers "brown bag it": they pack their sandwiches, fruits, cookies, etc. all into a brown bag, and bring it to work with them. If the office has a lunchroom [午餐室], then the brown-baggers can eat lunch together. If not, then they might have to eat by themselves at their desks.

> Now, not everyone uses an actual brown bag to bring their lunch to work. But even if you bring your lunch in a purple box, it can still be called brown bagging it. Additionally, sometimes when brown bag is said at work, it doesn't mean the food itself, but rather a kind of meeting or presentation that goes on during lunchtime [并不表示食物，而是一种在午饭时间进行的会议或者展示。]. Since these can sometimes be, shall we say, a little boring, the best way to escape them is to head to the nearby food court or cafeteria with your rich co-workers!

# III.New eating habits are killing the conventional lunch in America
> Once upon a time, when the clock struck noon[正午钟鸣], American workers would set aside [放下]their tools, sit down, and eat lunch - maybe a burger or a salad - possibly with a beer. But the halcyon /'hælsɪən/ [adj.平静的] days of lunch could soon be ending.[曾经闲适的午餐时光很快就要一去不复返了。]

> Lunch's largest existential /ˌɛɡzɪˈstɛnʃəl/ [adj.有关存在的] crisis is the millennials [千禧一代（指生于1982年到2000年的人群）] and Gen Z-ers [Z时代人群（指1990年代中叶至2000年后出生的人）] who are replacing the midday meal with snacks. There are now 12 billion [120亿] annual visits to restaurants and food-service outlets that amount to just a quick nibble /'nɪbl/ [很少量食物]. Instead of three-martini lunches[描绘商人和律师可以悠闲享受午餐的场景，他们有钱有闲，可以享受三杯马提尼，而不是一杯马提尼], younger consumers are opting for faster, cheaper alternatives like fresh fruit, yogurt, and chips.

> The majority of American office workers[白领], whatever they have for lunch, they probably dineal desko[在办公桌前解决]. Some 80% of employees don't take aregular lunch break. Rather, they cram /kræm/ in their calories solo[独自咀嚼午餐], and swiftly[看起来很凄凉]: on average it takes just 15 minutes to eat lunch. And while it may seemsad that so many of them are masticating /ˈmæstɪˌket/[v.咀嚼] alone, with only the glow of their screens for company, alot of people actually prefer it that way. In one study, a quarter of millennial employees agreed with the statement “I eat alone to multitask better.”[独自吃饭，可以同时解决多项任务]

# IV.grammar
# 1.Neither am I & neither do I & me neither 
> 1)In today’s dialogue, the speaker, Sarah, responded to Sean’s question by saying, “neither.” In this case, “neither” was used as a very casual and shortened version of “neither am I” or “me neither.”[“neither”用法非常随意， 是“neither am I”或者 “me neither”的简化形式。]

> 2)“Neither am I,” “neither do I” and “me neither” can all be used to say “me too” when you are agreeing with a negative sentence (e.g., A: I don’t like coffee. B: Me neither).[但你要对否定句表示赞同时，“neither am I,” “neither do I” 和 “me neither”这三个短语都可以使用。]

> 3)Sometimes, native speakers will use “me either” instead of “me neither.” Some may consider this to be incorrect, but it is frequently used in spoken English.[有时候母语者会说“me either”而不是“me neither”。有些人认为“me either”这种说法是错误的，但是英语口语 中经常听到这种说法.]

- A: I don't go clubbing often. B: Yeah, neither.

- A: I can't believe he's 60. B: Me neither!

- A: I really don't want to wake up at 5 a.m. tomorrow! B: Neither do I!

# 2.ordering in [phr.叫外卖] & get delivery & eating out [phr.在外面吃饭] & eating in & eat and run [phr.吃好就走] & grabbing [v.匆忙的吃] 
> 1）"Order in" that means you call the delivery guy. it sounds exactly the same to me. Are you getting delivery or going out for lunch? Are you ordering in or going out for lunch?

> 2)"Eating out" means going out to eat.Nothing too crazy here. Doesn't have to be only used for lunch. Of course, you could also have dinner with your friends and family, and go eat out at a restaurant.

> 3)eating in :And that could be ordering in or cooking your own food at your house.

> 4) "eat and run" here just basically means you need to eat quickly, then go.Should say one thing about this phrase. This is a great chance for you to show your politeness if your friend treats you to lunch or dinner, and then you have to leave. You can just say sorry to eat and run.

> 5) "grabbing," It just means to get something quickly.casually you can grab a sandwich. You can grab a coffee. You can grab a beer.so it's just a great thing that you do you with friends. Now, if you are on a date with a very beautiful girl or a very handsome guy, maybe you should go to that place with great reviews. With your friends, just go grab a sandwich.

# 3.a round [n.每人一点]
> 1)so "a round"—this is a counter, right? It's a counter for a group of things.So, basically, if you are with your friends and you go to a bar or a restaurant and everybody, you know, is going to have some beers. 

> 2)You can say "a round of beers," but we don't just use it for beers. We use it for a lot of things.Yeah, like 'a round of questions.'Or 'a round of cocktails.'Or 'a round of chicken wings.' Ooh! Yum yum!How about 'a round of applause.'We can also use it for that! Or, when we're talking about sports, 'a round of tennis'—that's like a game of tennis, right?Yeah. You could even say, 'a round of bowling'.

# 4.feel like & be down for sth [phr.赞同某事] & I could really go for [phr.真想选择/要] & getting old [phr.感到厌烦]
> 1)A great phrase to express how you are feeling.How you're feeling or even what you want to eat.So whenever I think about eating Thai food, I might say like, "I feel like Thai food."because feel really can be like "I feel sick." "I feel great." But in this case it's just the way that we express what we want to eat.

> 2)feel like is more about something we want to do. It’s commonly used when making a choice. Because of that, “feel like” is never followed by an adjective. Here is the pattern for “feel like.”

> 3) be down for sth, it means 'I'd be cool with that/I'd be okay with that.

> 4)" I could really go for" this kind of means that 'I really want this,' or 'I'd be up for this.'Yeah, 'I'd like to have something.

> 5)But this "could really go for"— we don't always just use it with beer. You could say, "I could really go for some coffee," or "I could really go for a walk. I'd like to go outside." 

- 1. I feel like + SUBJECT [主语] + VERB + OBJECT[宾语] (I feel like I want pizza.) 

- 2. I feel like + NOUN (I feel like pizza.) 

- 3. I feel like + GERUND[动名词] + NOUN (I feel like eating pizza.) 

- 4. Most people don't feel like exercising every day. 

- 5. She said she feels like a romance movie, but I'd prefer action. 

- 6. I feel like I want some beer. It's been a tough day. 

> 6）if something is getting old, you don't really want to do it anymore or hear it anymore. Like if everyday I came in and made fun of Lisa's shoes, you know, maybe the first couple times she act like ha ha ha ha ha. But then after a month she'll be like, "All right. That's getting a little old."

# 5.load up on [phr.多加、多点] & toppings [n.浇头]
> 1)"Load up." So this just means 'get a lot of.Okay, so you can load up on other things than just toppings, you can load up on booze.You can load up on necessities.Yeah, or maybe if you like to read, you might load up on the books when shopping.

> Basically, a lot of times we load up on things to prepare for later. If there's going to be a big snowstorm, you know. It's like "ah, go to the store and load up on food" because we won't be able to go out for a long time.

> 2)in this case, if he's loading up on the toppings, maybe he wants to add a lot of cheese and tomatoes to his nachos.I guess he's not worried about his waistline.

# 6.split [v.分开] & share & split the bill [AA制]
> Well, there are some things you can split which is to share, but there's something you can share, but it's not splitting.

> 1)when you split something, you're cutting it in half. So, for example, I'm not gonna say, "let's split the bathroom," right? I'm not cutting the bathroom in half, right? I'll say let's share the bathroom.

> 2)And parents usually say to their kids, "You need to share your toys with the other kids." But, you can't split your toys because you're just going to break them.

> 3)So splitting the bill at the end of the night—you pay fifty, I pay fifty, and we're all good.

# 7.big eater [n.大胃王]
> sometimes we also say like that you have a big appetite.'Appetite' /'æpɪtaɪt/ just means your ability to eat or not, basically.

# 8.to be tight on time [phr.时间紧迫] & be tight on money 
> 1)"to be tight on time" means you don't have any spare time. We can use this for other things too. Like maybe you have a tight schedule.

> 2)or just to use this same structure that we see in the dialogue. You can be tight on money.Little tight on money this month.

# 9.cafeteria /ˌkæfə'tɪrɪə/ [n.自助餐厅] & canteen /kæn'tin/ [n.食堂] & food court [n.小吃街] & packed [adj.拥挤的]
> 1)usually when we're talking about high schools, universities, big companies, they use the word "cafeteria."

> 2)when I think of "canteen," I think of the army.Yeah, or camp. Like summer camp had a canteen. I mean I'm sure if you go to a different city or maybe a different state in America, they might use "canteen" more than "cafeteria."

> 3)this is the place in the mall that has all the restaurants, usually fast food restaurants.Right, so they'll be a McDonald's in the food court.or a Subway or a KFC.whereas the cafeteria or the canteen, it might have all the same foods like hamburgers or sandwiches. But it's usually just one company that runs the cafeteria.

> 4）"Be packed," So we use this word to express that a place is very full of people.Like for example,we were packed on the bus like sardines /ˌsɑr'din/ [n.沙丁鱼]. Disneyland is always packed.That sounds like kind of a positive packed, I guess, unless you just really want to go by yourself.

# 10.fresh out of [phr.快没有] & newly out of
> 1) We're talking about food, but this fresh doesn't really refer to food.So when something is fresh, it's new. So in this way, it's kind of like, right now I am newly out of time. another person could say like "fresh out of luck."

> 2)And it's also a polite way to emphasize you really don't have any time in this case.

# 11.sandwich it is
> "Sandwich it is," which it's actually a great little point we should probably talk about before the dialogue. "Sandwich it is" just sounds like "okay it's been decided. It is a sandwich."
