# 1.scones /skɒns/ or /skəʊns/ [n. 司康饼] & biscuit 
> 1)This two pronunciations for this word. My family say /skɒn/.It's like a lightly sweetened, it's kind of like a very sort of dense thick cake, hard to describe unless you've had one or seen one. It's similar to what you guys you call biscuits.Yeah, but here a scone is, it's more sweet.it's almost kind of like a little cake almost.

> 2)Right, in America we have these things called biscuits and they're, they're kind of like a type of bread. They're round, they're kind of like you said thick, but the ones in America are usually kind of salty or savory.Yeah, you eat them with a meal

# 2.tarts [n.果馅饼]
> Oh, wow, that's awesome, cool. But yeah, so here it's probably a smaller tart, and like you said, a tart is kind of like a fruit pie without a top on it.Usually it's a sweet thing but you can get savory tarts, but usually would be like lemon tart or the apple tart.Yeah, so usually when you get like a sandwich or a cake that doesn't have a top on it, we also call that like open-faced, so the tart, it's kind of like the open-faced pie.


# 9.fingers sandwiches [n.手指三明治]

> It's, it's almost kind of like a dessert type thing. Yeah yeah, it's kind of like a little cake almost. Yeah, okay cool. So the scones, scones, sorry, scones. It's gonna come with jam and clotted cream. Okay so cream like comes from, like cows milk right?Yeah, it's like thick milk. I'm not an expert on how to make cream. It's delicious.Okay, so clotted cream is like a, it's a thick cream.So cream can usually be like a liquid, right? But clotted cream is more, well, it's solid.Yes, so if you, if you had it in a, in a glass or bowl, and you turn it upside down, it would stay in the bowl.Yeah, I mean eventually my, kind of slide out. But, yeah, you're right. It'll probably stay in the bowl. What about after all this stuff? They got a lot of food here.

# 11.tiers[n.层]
> 1)Right, so imagine a plate /plet/ [n.盘子] and that's, it has food on it, and then on top of that plate, there is another smaller plate.And then on top of that plate, there is another smaller plate, so it's like three plates.Okay, but they're not like all on top. They're like connected to each other, right?Yes so there's, there's like a pole through the middle, so that they don't, plates don't touch the food.Okay, so it kind of like comes out on this thing that we call like a tray  /tre/ [n.盘子], almost is like a three tiered tray, has so basically tiers are different levels, right?. 

> 2)So tier, like I said is like a level, right? And so in China, there're a lot of different sized cities. Some are really big and some are smaller, still awfully big.These are, well, the biggest ones Shanghai Beijing, these are your first tier cities.Right and then you have second tier and third tier cities, right, so like different levels.

> 3)And tiers can also talk about maybe like at a company. So maybe the manager is on the higher tier.The top tier right?And like maybe some other new employee is, like in a, you know on a lower tier in the company. Either way go ahead and look at the expansion section guys. So Ella uses the word here to talk about what they're going to eat first?


# 12.full treatment 
> The full treatment. So when you get the full treatment, and sometimes we might say special treatment, but it just means like you kind of get everything.Okay, so like basically what she means here is that she's having the starters, she's having all the different food, and the awesome tea. So she's getting the full British afternoon tea experience.It just like, it means you get everything from A to Z. So one example we have, "Those VIP tickets really allowed us to receive the full treatment at the event." Right? Or "On her birthday, I took Judy to a SPA where she got the full treatment." So she didn't just get her feet you know down, she got her back, her hands, everything.

- on her birthday,I took Judy to a spa where she got the full treatment.[好好享受一番]
- Those VIP tickets really allowed us to receive the full treatment at the event.

# 13.proper [adj.体面讲究的，合乎体统的]
> 1)“proper" is kind of we might also say fiting in the way. So it means like correct. One example we have here in the expansion section is "This is not the proper climate to grow bananas." So you can't grow bananas here, it won't work.It's not proper, right? 

> 2)But proper can like you said, so it can also just be like authentic. I feel like this is a word people use and British English much more than American English. You might say like "He's a, he's a proper fellow."

# 14.customs /'kʌstəmz/ [n.习俗、传统] & tradition  /trə'dɪʃən/ [n. 传统]

> 2)tradition has more like, for example you might say, "Oh, it's my custom to make a cake this way." But you might not say, "It's my tradition to make a cake this way." "Tradition" is more like maybe like society or something like...Okay, or like tradition could be like, a holiday could be a tradition.Right, we also say family tradition.Oh, it's our family tradition that we celebrate the holiday this way.

# 15.thrilled  /θrɪld/ [adj. 非常兴奋的] & excited & thriller [n.恐怖小说]
> 1)"thrilled", so this is like super excited.Yeah I'm really happy, very excited.and it's not like formal, but it's used to really emphasize that you really are excited about it.
