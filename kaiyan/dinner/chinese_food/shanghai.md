# I.Chinese breakfast
> Chinese breakfast is very different from a typical American breakfast. most Americans eat granola /ɡrəˈnolə/ [n.格兰诺拉麦片], cereal /'sɪrɪəl/ [早餐谷物], milk, and fruit for breakfast. They like having cold and refreshing food in the morning, whereas Chinese breakfast tends to be hot and filling. 

> One of the reasons that some foreigners in China can't get used to Chinese breakfast is because the style is so different than in the West. For example, most breakfasts in the West are cold instead of hot: People often eat such foods as bread, bagels, cereal, or yogurt. In addition, breakfast food is usually sweeter in the West, as opposed to being savory.

> Of course, Americans like things such as scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast too. But they're usually for the weekends, when people have more time to cook.

# II.grammar
# 1.type
## 1)smoked fish /smoʊkt fɪʃ/ [n.熏鱼] & Flash Fried River shrimp [油爆河虾]

## 2)seitan /ˋsetæn/ / gluten /ˈglutən/ [面筋、烤麸] 
> And that's true it is gluten, but we don't really call it that as a dish.Everything is gluten free. Like gluten is a really bad word right now, so this dish is only gluten, so you really don't want to call it that. So Diana and I we both know this word seitan, we don't really know where it comes from.Asia probably, anyway. So no matter where it comes from and just don't call it gluten in English.

## 3)soy braised pork /sɔɪ breɪzd pɔrk/ [红烧肉] & Deep fired pork cutlet /'kʌtlət/ [n.炸猪排]
> 1)hongshaorou:this is one dish that is actually very very common in North America, I have a feeling that a lot of foreigners would already know the name, even if they wouldn't know how to order it in Chinese, they would understand the English easily.

> 2)"braised"really just means like stewed for a very long time. However a lot of people will understand you if you just say "braised pork".However one thing to note is that Hong Shao means specifically to braise in a dark soy sauce.

## 4)pinenut / squirrel [ˈskwərəl] fish [松鼠鱼] & pinenut /paɪn nʌt/ [松仁，松子]
> I think this dish is also translated to, I think, mostly translated to pinenut fish. I have seen both. So make sure you know both of these translations, then you will be ready. this dish also comes with a sweet and sour sauce that's poured over it.so this sauce is probably going to be. at least from an American point of view, this is going to be like the most common Chinese sauce.

## 5)Crab cakes [蟹饼；蟹肉饼] & crawfish /'krɔ'fɪʃ/ [n.小龙虾] & Hairy crab [n.大闸蟹] 

## 6)TangOu [糖藕] & lotus root /ˈloʊtəs rut/ [莲藕]
> I would say like lotus root and then any time your gonna hear like Tang, a lot of people want to say sugar, but in this case it would just be sweet again, so like sweet lotus root, And it's usually stuffed with, you know, sticky rice [糯米] as well. We also have shrimp.it's really just shrimp but I always see people translated as crystal shrimp, that sounds like better, cooler and fancier.

## 7)steamed dumplings /stimd/ [小笼包] & Cold dumplings [冷混沌] & With peanut/almond butter: 蘸花生/杏仁酱
> These are gonna be steamed dumplings, they're steamed in the basket.

## 8)Shanghai osmanthus /ɔz'mænθəs/ cake [n.上海桂花糕] & green dumplings [青团] 

## 9)Chicken,Mushroom,Ham Threads /θrɛd/ in consomme /kən'sɔmei/ [n.扣三丝]

## 10)Borscht /bɔrʃt/ [n.罗宋汤]

## 11)rice wine [n.米酒] & yellow wine [n.黄酒]

# 2.be big on + n/doing sth [n.喜欢]
>  David tells Sarah that "Shanghai food is pretty big on sweet soy flavor." These two little words, "big on," mean "all about" or "crazy about" or "full of enthusiasm for." You can use this phrase to describe any thing or activity you really like or enjoy.

- 1. I'm not a huge fan of cake, but I'm really big on ice cream.

- 2. They're not big on watching football, but they never miss the Super Bowl.

- 3. My friends and I used to be big on karaoke, but now we just don't have the energy.

- 4. He was never big on spicy food until he went to Sichuan.

# 3.flavored
> 1)So if you're describing something having a certain flavor, you can say, you know, this is bacon flavored ice cream or this is orange flavored alcohol.so important there that you add the "ed" on the end, So a lot of times we buy things and there's more than just one flavor, so we can say that, for example, this ice cream comes in ten different flavors.

> 2)Shanghai food is big on sweet soy flavor.

# 4.hands down [phr.毫无疑问]
> 1)Now Sarah says:"David, hands down, this is my favorite dish."So is she telling him like: Put your hands down! I want to talk to you.she maybe puts her hands down since this is just the best dish i've ever had.what she is saying is that, there is no question or there is no doubt. Really this is just absolutely the best food i've ever had.

> 2)without doubt, without question, you don't need to say those words, you could just say hands down.usually the thing that comes after the hands down is a word that's kind of like the best, the greatest,or the worst, or your favorite.

# 5.full treatment & in for a treat [phr.被款待]
> 1)So when you get the full treatment, and sometimes we might say special treatment, but it just means like you kind of get everything.so like basically what she means here is that she's having the starters, she's having all the different food, and the awesome tea. So she's getting the full British afternoon tea experience.It just like, it means you get everything from A to Z. So one example we have, "Those VIP tickets really allowed us to receive the full treatment at the event." Or "On her birthday, I took Judy to a SPA where she got the full treatment." So she didn't just get her feet you know down, she got her back, her hands, everything.

- 1. on her birthday,I took Judy to a spa where she got the full treatment.[好好享受一番]

- 2. Those VIP tickets really allowed us to receive the full treatment at the event.

- 3. Rob will have to undergo full medical treatment to beat the disease.[全面治疗]

> 2)‘in for a treat’ means, you are about to be very happy.It's going to be a treat for her, it's going to be a really really happy experience that will make her satisfied. "Well you're in for a treat."

# 6.proper [adj.体面讲究的，合乎体统的]
> 1)“proper" is kind of we might also say fiting in the way. So it means like correct. One example we have here in the expansion section is "This is not the proper climate to grow bananas." So you can't grow bananas here, it won't work.It's not proper, right? 

> 2)But proper can like you said, so it can also just be like authentic. I feel like this is a word people use and British English much more than American English. You might say like "He's a, he's a proper fellow."

# 7.customs /'kʌstəmz/ [n.习俗、传统] & tradition  /trə'dɪʃən/ [n. 传统]
> 1)Right, and then so maybe by celebrating the holiday that way you have certain little customs. I kind of feel like tradition is bigger than customs.Yeah I feel like custom is like something that you're used to doing or it's used to being this way. While tradition is much more formal.Yeah I feel like custom is like something that you're used to doing or it's used to being this way. While tradition is much more formal.

> 2)tradition has more like, for example you might say, "Oh, it's my custom to make a cake this way." But you might not say, "It's my tradition to make a cake this way." "Tradition" is more like maybe like society or something like...Okay, or like tradition could be like, a holiday could be a tradition.Right, we also say family tradition.Oh, it's our family tradition that we celebrate the holiday this way.
