# I.Shaanxi food in America 
> We talk about American Chinese food a lot in our lessons. While there is a lot of Chinese food in America, in the past it hasn't always tasted like the Chinese food you can find in China [不是很正宗]. These days, that is changing: more and more restaurants sell authentic food from all over The Middle Kingdom. 

> For example, Xi'an Famous Foods is a very popular restaurant in New York City that sells noodles, roujiamo, and other delicious Shaanxi food. Originally it was a bubble tea shop [奶茶店], but overtime the owners decided to focus on the kind of foods their grandfather used to make back in Shaanxi. Xi'an Famous Foods is not only very popular among overseas Chinese and students, but also with local Americans. It is so popular, in fact, that today, they have opened twelve restaurants all around New York City.

# II.grammar
# 1.you/one can never have too much/many + n.
>  1)"you can never have too much lamb!" He means that lamb is so good, that it is impossible for anyone to have too much of it. It's a fun little expression that shows just how much you like something, or just how useful or desirable it is.

> 2)you can use both "you" and "one" in this phrase, as in "one can never have to much lamb." The meaning is the same.

> 3) lamb is an uncountable noun. If you want to use a countable noun, then you must change "much" to "many."

- 1. Dad always told me that you can never have too much wine.

- 2. You can never have too much sleep.

- 3. One can never have too many good friends.

- 4. I used to think that one could never have too many books, then I had to move them.

# 2.bingmayong / Terracotta Warriors /Terracotta ˈwɔriərz/ [n.兵马俑] & chariots /ˈʧɛriəts/ [敞篷双轮马车]

# 3.character [n.汉子、演员、性格]
> 1)So if you guys have ever seen this character for biang, I'm guessing you probably have, it's a little bit complicated.

> 2)So the Chinese language aside, we can say that your character is kind of like your personality.or you can say her character is quite flawed /flɔd/ [adj.有缺陷的].my dad always used to say, he's a real character.so next time you have a friend who's, you know, maybe a little special.You can just say like "Well, he's a real character."

> 3)so in movies or books you know these characters, these people, they're usually pretty interesting.

# 4.on-the-go breakfast [adj.可以拿着边走边吃的早餐]
> on-the-go breakfast. So this means you can eat it while you're going somewhere, while you're doing something.

# 5.oily [adj.油腻的] & greasy
> 1)I think, a lot of food that's oily is the food you actually add the oil to.it's been cooked in oil. oily has the sort of more healthy sense to it. Like if a pasta is oily or a salad is oily. Oil is good for you,Olive oil.don't say greasy skin. You can say oily skin. But greasy skin is like an insult. Get your greasy hands off me.

> 2)Whereas food that is greasy, it might just be fatty. Like a hamburger, you don't usually cook it in grease. But it has a lot of fat. So the grease, the oil, comes out of the meat. But you could get rid of the grease before eating it.for a McDonald's hamburger would be greasy. Or those eggs are greasy. But you wouldn't really say that they're oily.greasy is usually used when we talked about frying things.So, for example, chips are greasy. French fries are greasy. And you know, like really heavy meat with a lot of fat can be greasy as well.greasy is usually for frying things, French fries like that. 

# III.Type
# 1.Skewers /ˈskjuː.ɚ/ [串儿] & kebabs /kəˈbɑbz/ [烤肉串]
> 1)kebabs:Meats chunks on a stick. The stick is the important part here. But there could also be veggies.that's my impression of a kebab. It's kind of like mixed some veggies, some meat.some onion, some more meat.

## 1)lamb skewers /læm / [羊肉串] & Beef skewers [牛肉串] & cumin /ˈkʌmɪn/ [孜然] & gamey /ɡeimi/ [味道膻]
> lamb is like a younger sheep.

## 2)chicken wings [鸡翅] & Buffalo wings [布法罗辣鸡翅] & chicken on the bone [带骨鸡肉]

## 3)drumsticks /ˈdrʌmstɪks/ [鸡小腿] & chicken thighs /θai/ [n.鸡大腿]

## 5)Barbecue cold noodle [烤冷面]

## 6)ribs [排骨] & BBQ ribs
> they always come with the bone.

## 7)burgers [n.肉饼] & beef patty /'pæti/ [n.肉饼、小馅饼]
> When we say burger or hamburger, maybe we're talking about the whole thing, you know, with the bread,the bun,the lettuces and tomato. But we could just be talking about the meat itself,so the patty,burger patty.

# 2.mutton /ˈmʌtən/ stew with bread [羊肉泡馍] 
> when I think mutton,I think kind of like an older,tougher sheep.so you need to stew it to get it all tender again,so stew is basically like a thick soup.and with bread in here just means you're adding a kind of Pita bread.

# 3.Cold noodles [凉皮、凉面] & seitan /ˋsetæn/ / gluten /ˈglutən/ [面筋、烤麸] 
> 1)Cold noodle can really mean anything.

> 2) And that's true it is gluten, but we don't really call it that as a dish.Everything is gluten free. Like gluten is a really bad word right now, so this dish is only gluten, so you really don't want to call it that. So Diana and I we both know this word seitan, we don't really know where it comes from.Asia probably, anyway. So no matter where it comes from and just don't call it gluten in English.

# 4.chinese salad/ cold-mixed dishes / cold appetizers [凉菜] & Cilantro [n.香菜] & Scallions [葱花]

# 5.roujiamo/Chinese/Qing burger [肉夹馍] & Sloppy Joe /ˈslɑpi ʤoʊ/ [碎牛肉饼；碎牛肉三明治] 
> 1)roujiamo,and you know a lot of people do call this the Chinese hamburger.

> 2)this food we call it a sloppy Joe. I think the difference between a hamburger and a sloppy Joe is that the meat in the middle.Whereas the sloppy Joe is much more like this Chinese hamburger.so that's gonna be like ground meat with a sauce.

# 6.Steamed broom /brum/ corn millet /'mɪlɪt/ bun [n.黄馍馍]

# 7.steamed buns /sbʌnz/ [包子] 
> baozi:if you check the dictionary, it will always say steamed bun, or maybe it will say, you know, steamed bun with stuffing or filling.but a steamed bun, so a bun is kind of like usually that kind of a piece of the bread, but it's not flat, round usually.

# 8.Qishan noodles with minced /mɪns/ 切碎的 pork [n.岐山臊子面] & Lantian Biangbiang noodles [n.蓝田裤带面]
> now minced here is basically chopped very finely.

# 9.Congee /'kɑndʒi/ [粥] & Porridge [燕麦粥] & oats /oʊts/ 燕麦片 & granola /grəˈnoʊlə/ [脆燕麦片] & Pickles [n.榨菜、咸菜] 
> 1)Congee:we would probably say porridge. Although for American, usually porridge is made using oats.But congee is made of rice.

> 2)Porridge:It's made from oats, not from rice. It's topped with sugar and cinnamon, instead of pickles. But just like the Chinese congee, oatmeal is also served hot. There're also many instant oatmeal products in America, including the famous Quaker Instant Oatmeal [桂格速溶燕麦]. 

> 3)pickles. In America pickles are just, like cucumber. to be salty and lots of vinegar.Whereas in China, it's really all kinds of different things，there's many different pickled vegetables in China.

# 10.soya/soy milk /ˈsɔɪə/ [豆浆] & fried dough /fraɪd doʊ/ [油条] & deep-fried [adj.油炸] &  alongside /əˈlɔŋˈsaɪd/ [一起、搭配] & combo [n.组合、套餐]
> 1）alongside:Kind of just means "with", it's a really fancy way to say with.

> 2)so a combo just means, for something to be together. It's short for combination.So when something is alongside, something else you could call it a combo.Especially at McDonalds. If you buy a burger, some French fries, and a cola, that's a combo.

# 11.flatbread /flæt brɛd/ [饼、烧饼] 
> shaobing:this isn't the kind of bread that you would buy at a bakery.it's not like western style bread.So any bing kind of you can call it flatbread.

# 12.Chinese crepes/kreɪp/ / breakfast wrap /ræp/ [山东煎饼] & crispy fried flatbread [n.薄脆] & sweet bean sauce [n.甜面酱] & Hot sauce [n.辣酱] 
> jianbing:so I guess we don't really have a term for jianbing in English.Because it's not very common back home [我们那里没有].I would be OK with Chinese pancake, actually it's kind of more like a wrap.so maybe it's a Chinese breakfast wrap, sounds about right.

# 14.xinjiang cut cake [n.切糕] & Xinjiang polu [n.抓饭]

***I’m so happy you finally got to see the Terracotta Warriors, Sarah!***

***I know. What an incredible experience! But now I’m starving. What’s for lunch?***

***Well we should start with some mutton stew with bread.***

***Okay great. Oh could we get a few lamb skewers too?***

***Good idea. You can never have too much lamb!***

***Hey, what’s this? It kind of looks like a hamburger!***

***That’s “roujiamo”. Actually, a lot of people do call it the Chinese Hamburger. I just call it delicious.***

***I’m in the mood for some noodles too. Could we get these cold noodles with sesame sauce and cucumbers?***

***Those are good, but I really suggest you try these ones, biangbiang noodles.***

***Oh wow, look at that character. Can you write that?***

***Hey, the waiter's here!***

# III.pattern
***So Katie, what kind of Chinese breakfast items do you like?***

***I like steamed buns, especially veggie buns. I usually grab one every morning alongside a cup of soya milk.***

***Yeah, that’s a great combo!***

***Buns are also good with congee. Have you tried it?***

***Yes, I have. But I have to say congee is not really my first choice for breakfast. I’m not used to eating rice first thing in the morning.***

***But it’s more like a soup. A bowl of congee with some pickles and a youtiao on the side are my favorite!***

***Youtiao? You mean fried dough? That's too oily for me. But I love tea eggs! They taste much better than hard-boiled eggs.***
