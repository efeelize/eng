# I.Shaanxi food in America 
> We talk about American Chinese food a lot in our lessons. While there is a lot of Chinese food in America, in the past it hasn't always tasted like the Chinese food you can find in China. These days, that is changing: more and more restaurants sell authentic food from all over The Middle Kingdom. For example, Xi'an Famous Foods is a very popular restaurant in New York City that sells noodles, roujiamo, and other delicious Shaanxi food. Originally it was a bubble tea shop, but overtime the owners decided to focus on the kind of foods their grandfather used to make back in Shaanxi. Xi'an Famous Foods is not only very popular among overseas Chinese and students, but also with local Americans. It is so popular, in fact, that today, they have opened twelve restaurants all around New York City.

***Good idea. You can never have too much lamb!***

***Hey, what’s this? It kind of looks like a hamburger!***
