# 1.the spicier, the better /ðə ˈspaɪsɪər, ðə ˈbɛtər/ [越辣越好] 
>  This is just one example of the pattern "the [more of something], the better." We don't only use this to talk about spice, it can be used in all kinds of different situations. You don't always have to use "the better" either. In fact there is another common expression "the more, the merrier." That said, focusing on this version of the pattern might help you to grasp it better.

- 1. I like strong coffee: the stronger, the better!

- 2. The sooner we start, the better.

- 3. My wife loves sweet foods: the sweeter, the better!

- 4. We want our new apartment to be on a higher level. The higher, the better!

- 5. The earlier I go to bed, the better I feel in the morning.

***I'm so excited to finally eat authentic Sichuan food, Jay!***

***It's probably not what you're used to in America, Sarah. Real Sichuan food has "one hundred dishes, one hundred flavors.***

***I want to try the Kung Pao Chicken. And I've heard a lot about Mapo Tofu.***

***So you can eat spicy food?***

***I love spicy food! The spicier, the better!***

***Well, Sichuan peppercorns have a pretty special flavor. It's a numbing kind of spicy.***

***How about we order some fish too?***

***Good idea. Sichuan boiled fish is really something else. Just watch out for the bones!***

***Will do. Do you think that'll be enough?***

***I think we should get some cold noodles too. They come with a spicy peanut sauce.***

***Everything looks amazing! I don't even know where to start!***

***So glad you like it! But next time you visit, we're definitely eating Hot pot!***
