# I.Sichuan food in America
> For many years, the only Chinese food you could find in America was either from Guangdong province [粤菜] or Sichuan province [川菜]. However, Sichuan is not the way you will see the word spelled. Rather, signs would say "Szechuan", which nobody knows how to pronounce. Often, a Chinese restaurant would serve both styles of food, as well as more Western food like hamburgers.

> These days however, more and more Chinese from different parts of China are immigrating to Western countries, and they are bringing their local foods with them. Now in the big cities it's much easier to find all different kinds of Chinese food, both inside Chinatown and out [之内还是以外]. Since not as many Chinese people move to smaller towns and cities, however, if you go there you will still likely see the old Cantonese and Szechuan restaurants.

# II.grammar
# 1.the spicier, the better /ðə ˈspaɪsɪər, ðə ˈbɛtər/ [越辣越好] 
>  This is just one example of the pattern "the [more of something], the better." We don't only use this to talk about spice, it can be used in all kinds of different situations. You don't always have to use "the better" either. In fact there is another common expression "the more, the merrier." That said, focusing on this version of the pattern might help you to grasp it better.

- 1. I like strong coffee: the stronger, the better!

- 2. The sooner we start, the better.

- 3. My wife loves sweet foods: the sweeter, the better!

- 4. We want our new apartment to be on a higher level. The higher, the better!

- 5. The earlier I go to bed, the better I feel in the morning.
