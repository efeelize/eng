# I.Sichuan food in America
> For many years, the only Chinese food you could find in America was either from Guangdong province [粤菜] or Sichuan province [川菜]. However, Sichuan is not the way you will see the word spelled. Rather, signs would say "Szechuan", which nobody knows how to pronounce. Often, a Chinese restaurant would serve both styles of food, as well as more Western food like hamburgers.

> These days however, more and more Chinese from different parts of China are immigrating to Western countries, and they are bringing their local foods with them. Now in the big cities it's much easier to find all different kinds of Chinese food, both inside Chinatown and out [之内还是以外]. Since not as many Chinese people move to smaller towns and cities, however, if you go there you will still likely see the old Cantonese and Szechuan restaurants.

# II.grammar
# 1.the spicier, the better /ðə ˈspaɪsɪər, ðə ˈbɛtər/ [越辣越好]

That said, focusing on this version of the pattern might help you to grasp it better.
