# I.Why is it called "Peking" duck?
> Although Western people might not be know about Peking Opera or Peking University, a good many of them will likely have heard of Peking Duck. Just as many will know that the capital of China is Beijing. So why is it called Peking duck and not Bejing duck? Did the name of the city change at some point in time?

> Some people think that the name Peking comes from one of China's many dialects /'daɪəlɛkt/ [方言]. In fact, it is because there are several different ways to transliterate Chinese into English. Before Hanyu Pinyin was introduced, the most common method was the Wade-Giles system [威妥玛式拼音法], created by British scholars scholars and diplomats [外交家]. Wade-Giles used many diacritics /ˌdaɪə'krɪtɪk/ [辨音符号], which are marks above or below letters to represent different sounds [这个拼音法要在字母上加很多辨音符号，来代表不同发音。]. Unfortunately when people began to use their system, they often left out these very important marks, leaving us with words like Peking, Chungking, and Nanking. Thus, there was never a "Peking" in the sense of a place called [ˈpɛkɪŋ], rather "Peking" is how Beijing was written in English using incorrect Wade-Giles, and it just stuck.
