# I.Cantonese in English
> The Cantonese were some of the first Chinese people to immigrate to Western countries. In big cities like New York, San Francisco, London, and Toronto, Chinatowns were built by these early immigrants. Since then, Cantonese has had such a big influence on Western culture, especially on food and food names. People love to eat chow mein [炒面], chow fun [炒饭], wontons[馄饨], and lo mein [捞面]. Similarly, you can always find bok choy [白菜] in supermarkets. But the Cantonese that Western people understand is not all about food [不全是食物]. 

> During Spring Festival in big cities, it's very common to hear local people greet each other with "Gung Hei Fa Choy." If someone is very eager or excited to do something, Western people say they are "gung-ho". If they want something done very quickly, they might say "chop chop." But by far the most Cantonese expression that Western people use everyday (often without knowing where it comes from) is "long time no see!"

# II.grammar 
# 1.Be a big/huge/giant fan of sth 
> 1)while it's common to hear "I'm a fan of _____," it's a little bit more common to hear that you are NOT a fan of something. Additionally, you will often hear adjectives like "big" "huge" or "giant" used before "fan." Remember that it must be followed by a noun, or the -ing form of a verb.

> 2)the singular form of fan has no S. You would only say "fans" if you are talking about more than one fan.

- 1. I'm not really a fan of mushrooms.

- 2. She didn't used to be such a fan of complaining.

- 3. My son told me that he isn't a fan of doing homework.

- 4. He's a big fan of horror movies.

- 5. It's such a pleasure to meet you. I'm a big fan.

# 3.don't knock [批评] it till you've tried it.

# III.dim sum /dɪm sʌm/ [点心]
# 1.siu maai / pork /pɔrk/ dumplings [烧卖] & shrimp dumplings [虾饺] & wonton [混沌]
> 1)A lot of times in America at like a Cantonese restaurant, you'll see "siu maai", I've actually never called them pork dumplings myself.because I think most of the dumplings that Chinese people make do have pork in.

> 2)Maybe the most authentic Chinese food, wonton soup is something I'm sure you've all had before. Pork, and often shrimp and veggies, wrapped in a tasty dumpling skin and served in a delicious broth. 

# 2.bamboo steamers /bæmˈbu ˈstimərz/ [竹蒸笼] & steamed /stimd/ [蒸的]

# 5.rice noodle rolls /raɪs ˈnudəl roʊlz/ [肠粉]

# 6.turnip /'tɝnɪp/ radish /ˈrædɪʃ/ cake [萝卜糕] & carrot cake /ˈkærət keɪk/ [胡萝卜蛋糕]
> 1)one thing to note too is that a lot of times on the menu, they will call it a "turnip cake" instead of a "radish cake". So, depending on the restaurant you go to, it could be either or.

> 2)So "carrot cake" would be a carrot cake, and we actually do have that as a dessert, and it's really tasty but you're not going to find that at a regular Cantonese restaurant, probably.

# 7.sesame balls [芝麻球] & spring rolls [春卷]

# 8.pot stickers [锅贴] & gyoza [日式煎饺]

# IV.Soup
# 1.stew [n.炖菜] & broth /brɑθ/ [清汤] & soup 
> 1)there's a kind of soup called stew. And that has lots of pieces lots of meat lots of vegetables and not much broth not much water just a lot of pieces. It's just like a thick /θɪk/ [adj.浓稠的] soup.

> 2)some of my students will say they like to have soup but what they mean is like the water part like not the noodles not the meat not the vegetables the water and that's called the broth.so as you can see broth and soup are pretty similar but broth just tends to mean the water part and a lot of Chinese soups are mainly just broth, so for example you have chicken soups or any kind of like ginger soup.

***Yeah, you can never go wrong with those. Do they have BBQ pork buns?***

***They sure do. But maybe we can get the BBQ pork pastries instead since we’re ordering a lot of steamed dishes.***

***Sounds good. What about egg tarts for dessert?***

***Sure! Oh, we forgot chicken feet and beef tripe.***
