# I.Three tips for overcoming coffee addiction
# 1.aviod quitting cold turkey
> One technique which many people use to quit coffee is to simply stop drinking it all at once. In this way, you may have increased symptoms of withdrawal such as insomnia, anxiety and headaches.

# 2.cut back gradually 
> If you drink five cups of coffee per day then you can start by cutting down to four. Once you get used to this level then try to cut down to three then two then one or zero. This method of cutting back slowly does not cause any shock to your system and you will suffer much less from the uncomfortable withdrawal symptoms.

# 3.make a cup of weaker coffee
> There is nothing more delicious and invigorating than a nice cup of strong coffee in the morning. However, if you are looking to nip your coffee drinking habit in the bud, then one thing you can do is to add less coffee when preparing your cup.

> For example, if you are used to adding three tablespoons per cup then why not try adding two tablespoons and gradually cut back from there. While your coffee will be weaker you can still maintain the taste to a certain degree by using high-quality coffee.

# II.grammar
# 1.If you say so & whatever you say
