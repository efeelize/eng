# 1.tapas /ˈtʌpəs/ [西班牙菜，小碟子的食物，有点像广式点心]
> Tapas are share plates that originated in Spain. Unlike most appetizers, which are meant to be eaten before the main course, tapas are usually eaten on their own with alcohol.  For many Spanish people, these bite-size plates are consumed before lunch and dinner, which is sometimes eaten as late as 12 a.m. As such, Spaniards will often have a mid-afternoon snack between 5:30-7:30 p.m., followed by tapas and dinner. Bars that serve tapas and drinks typically open after 8:30 p.m. in Spain.

***Thanks for inviting me out for Spanish food tonight, Bailey!***

***No problem. I can’t believe you’ve never had tapas.***

***Yeah. Well, there’s a first time for everything, right?***

***True. The first time I had them was in Spain but I’ve been all about these bite-size dishes ever since!***

***Well, since you’re the expert, what should we order?***

***Let’s start with the Spanish omelette and the garlic shrimp.***

***Alright, but I’m a big eater, so should we also split the paella?***

***Sure. And, we have to get two pitchers of sangria: one white and one red.***
