# Spanish 
# I.grammar
# 1.been all about [phr.热衷于]
> it just means that you really like it,for example,I am all about chocolate cake.

# 2.bite-size dishes 
> just means I can eat it in one bite with one mouthful.So, there are a lot of things that are bite-size,Like sushi or maybe chips.My favorite are little bite-size cookies.s

# II.type
# 1.tapas /ˈtʌpəs/ [西班牙点心] & dim sum /dɪm sʌm/ [广式点心]
> Tapas are share plates that originated in Spain. So there're a lot of little kind of light dishes.if you're not that hungry and you want to share something with your friends, you can get tapas.and usually you eat them really late at night with alcohol.

> 2)Unlike most appetizers, which are meant to be eaten before the main course, tapas are usually eaten on their own with alcohol.  For many Spanish people, these bite-size plates are consumed before lunch and dinner, which is sometimes eaten as late as 12 a.m. As such, Spaniards will often have a mid-afternoon snack between 5:30-7:30 p.m., followed by tapas and dinner. Bars that serve tapas and drinks typically open after 8:30 p.m. in Spain. 

# 2.paella /paɪ'ɛlə/ [西班牙海鲜饭]
> It is a rice dish and it has a lot of seafood in it like mussels /'mʌsəl/ [n.淡菜；贻贝] and shrimp.But it is a really heavy dish, so it's actually a main dish, so they normally eat it in the middle of the day, because in Spain they prefer to eat really late at night, so they like those light tapas.

# 3.sangria /sɑːnˈɡriː.ə/ [桑格利亚酒，葡萄酒里泡水果] & pitchers /ˈpɪʧərz/ [扎]
> 1)sangria is mixed with different alcohol and different juices, so like maybe orange juice, lemon juice, some brandy and of course white or red wine.So it has this really nice sort of a spicy zesty flavour to it, just to note though the classic one is the red sangria, so with red wine.

> 2)so a pitcher is kind of a large jug,a jug container, it's usually like six glasses. I mean you could also get the sangria in a glass but I think it more commonly comes in a pitcher.

# 4.garlic shrimp [蒜蓉虾]

# 5.Spanish omelette /omelette/ [西班牙煎蛋饼]
> it basically is an omelette which is kind of a mixture of egg that is fried, but there are a lot of things in it and what's inside of Spanish omelette is onions and potatoes.and you can add other things too, like sausage, you know, or like tomatoes just to make it a bit fancy.

***True. The first time I had them was in Spain but I’ve been all about these bite-size dishes ever since!***

***Well, since you’re the expert, what should we order?***

***Let’s start with the Spanish omelette and the garlic shrimp.***

***Alright, but I’m a big eater, so should we also split the paella?***

***Sure. And, we have to get two pitchers of sangria: one white and one red.***
