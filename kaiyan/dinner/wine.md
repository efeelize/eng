# V.pattern
***Hello there, welcome to Wine World. Let me know if I can help you out at all.***

***Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I’m going over to my boss's house for dinner tonight and don’t know what kind of wine I should bring.***

***OK, do you know what kind of food will be served?***

***Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi.***

***Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see... have to be a white wine, of course. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish.***

***I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right?***

***Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I’m not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more full-bodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.***

***That’s another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.The label says it’s got "attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bone-dry finish. Serve chilled." Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I'm on my way to the dinner now.***

***It’s okay, don’t worry, we'll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have quite as extensive a selection over here, but this Rhone Valley white would be lovely.this is a French wine, so they don’t always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess.***

***this is one of our best-sellers. It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it’s more approachable. It’s light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.***

# V.pattern
***Hello, would you like to see a wine list?***

***Yes please. What are your most popular reds?***

***Definitely the Australian Merlot and Pinot Noir and the Californian Malbec.***

***And what is your house red?***

***We have an Argentinian Cabernet Sauvignon and a Chilean Syrah.***

***The Cab Sauv has notes of currants and black cherries, and the Syrah has peppery undertones.***

***Ok. I usually drink Shiraz. Which is closest?***

***Syrah is actually the same. In Australia they call it Shiraz.***

***Ah. Gotcha. I’ll have the Syrah then. Is it heavily oaked?***

***Yes, it’s very oaky and heavy on the tannins.***

# V.pattern
***nothing is better after a long day of hiking in the Napa mountains than to unwind with a leisurely wine tasting.***

***Absolutely. Ah, here comes the tasting flight now. Which should we start with?***

***Let’s save the cabernet sauvignon for last – it’s probably still pretty tight and needs to breath. How about the sauvignon blanc?***

***it’s very acidic and bright, Very crisp, yes, with a hint of citrus. I would pair it with a nice fish filet.***

***Let’s try the chardonnay,Interesting, the bouquet is very fruity, almost a pineapple flavor.To be honest, this isn’t my cup of tea. It’s just not that complex.***

***let’s try this cab. this is very big and full-bodied. Lots of tannins.Extremely oaky as well. I love it.***

***You know, I really do think terroir makes a big difference in wines so have always preferred old world wines to new world. But this vintage from the Sonoma valley really knocks it out of the park. I think I’m going to buy a bottle.***
