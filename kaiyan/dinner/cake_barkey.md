# 2.cake 
## 1）Brownie /'braʊni/  布朗尼
> Brownies are a classic American dessert. It's basically chocolate cake but sometimes has nuts. To pronounce it, first say "brown" like the color, and then say "nee" just like the knee on your leg. 

## 2)Macarons /mækə'rɒn/  /mækə'rɒnz/.
> Macarons look like colourful sandwich cookies. The word sounds a lot like "macaroon," but that's actually a different dessert. So, make sure to keep the "o" short and say /mækə'rɒn/ or /mækə'rɒnz/.

## 3)Custard /'kʌstərd/ [卡仕达奶黄]
> Custard is like yellowy-white pudding. The "a" is not stressed so it sounds like a "u." Let's say it slowly [kʌ-stərd], and quickly ['kʌstərd].

## 4)caramel brulee /krem bruː'leɪ/ [焦糖炖蛋]
> This is a French custard with caramel on top. When you say the first word, keep the "e" short and say [krem] and not "cream." But, when you say "brulee" keep the "e" long and pronounce it like the letter "a." Let's practice it again: [krem bruː'leɪ].

## 5)souffle /su'fleɪ/ [蛋奶酥]
> A souffle is another French dessert. This one has a custard or chocolate bottom and a puffy cake-like top. Just like the "e" in brulee it sounds like the letter "a." So, start with [su] like the name Sue, and they say [fleɪ]. Once more, it's [su'fleɪ].

## 6）tarts /ɛg tɑrts/ [蛋挞]
> these egg tarts are the ones that are like yellow in the middle, kind of like brown and crusty on the sides.

## 7)Crepes /krep/ [法式可丽饼]
> Crepes are thin, flat pancakes that often have fruit inside. When saying the first part, remember to say [kreɪ] like "crazy." The singular noun is "crepe" and the plural is "crepes."

## 8)tiramisu /ˌtɪrəˈmɪˌsu/ [提拉米苏]
>  Tiramisu is a creamy, coffee-flavor cake. It's Italian so the pronunciation is a little tricky. Let's break it down: [tɪr-ə-mɪ-su]. And, once more a little faster. Just remember that the "a" in this word sounds more like an "uh."

## 9)lava cake /'lä-və keɪk/ /'lævə keɪk/ [熔岩蛋糕]
> Lava cakes have melted chocolate on the inside. They're called lava cakes because the melted chocolate looks like the lava of a volcano. You can say it 2 ways: ['lä-və] or ['lævə]. Either way, just remember to make the last "a" sound like an "uh. Once more, it's ['lä-və keɪk] or ['lævə keɪk].

## 10)red velvet /ˈvɛlvət/ cake [红丝绒蛋糕]
> This is a lovely red cake with cream cheese icing. Because of its color, it's really popular around Valentines. Now, the middle word "velvet" means smooth. To pronounce the "v" make sure your top teeth touch your lower lip. Let's practice: [vɛl-vət]. And all together, [rɛd ˈvɛlvət keɪk].

## 11)cheese  /ʧiz/ cake [芝士蛋糕]

# 3.pie
## 1)pecan pie /pə'kän paɪ/ /'piˌkæn paɪ/ [山核桃馅饼]
> This one is super sweet because it's a pie with caramelized pecans. Now, some people will say [pə'kän] and others will say ['piˌkæn] with a strong "e". Let's practice both [pə'kän paɪ] and ['piˌkæn paɪ].

## 2)tarts [n.果馅饼]
> so here it's probably a smaller tart, a tart is kind of like a fruit pie without a top on it.Usually it's a sweet thing but you can get savory tarts, but usually would be like lemon tart or the apple tart.Yeah, so usually when you get like a sandwich or a cake that doesn't have a top on it, we also call that like open-faced, so the tart, it's kind of like the open-faced pie.

## 3)apple crumble /ˈkrʌmbəl/ 苹果酥 

# 4.clotted  /ˈklɑtɪd/ cream [n.凝脂奶油] & mousse /mus/ 慕斯 & frosting /ˈfrɔstɪŋ/ 霜状白糖，通常覆盖在蛋糕表面 & paste /peɪst/ 酱
> 1)it's almost kind of like a dessert type thing. Yeah yeah, it's kind of like a little cake almost. Yeah, okay cool. So the scones, scones, sorry, scones. It's gonna come with jam and clotted cream. Okay so cream like comes from, like cows milk right?Yeah, it's like thick milk. I'm not an expert on how to make cream. It's delicious.Okay, so clotted cream is like a, it's a thick cream.So cream can usually be like a liquid, right? But clotted cream is more, well, it's solid.Yes, so if you, if you had it in a, in a glass or bowl, and you turn it upside down, it would stay in the bowl.Yeah, I mean eventually my, kind of slide out. But, It'll probably stay in the bowl. What about after all this stuff? They got a lot of food here.

# 11.tiers[n.层]
> 1)Right, so imagine a plate /plet/ [n.盘子] and that's, it has food on it, and then on top of that plate, there is another smaller plate.And then on top of that plate, there is another smaller plate, so it's like three plates.Okay, but they're not like all on top. They're like connected to each other, right?Yes so there's, there's like a pole through the middle, so that they don't, plates don't touch the food.Okay, so it kind of like comes out on this thing that we call like a tray  /tre/ [n.盘子], almost is like a three tiered tray, has so basically tiers are different levels, right?. 

> 2)So tier, like I said is like a level, right? And so in China, there're a lot of different sized cities. Some are really big and some are smaller, still awfully big.These are, well, the biggest ones Shanghai Beijing, these are your first tier cities.Right and then you have second tier and third tier cities, right, so like different levels.

> 3)And tiers can also talk about maybe like at a company. So maybe the manager is on the higher tier.The top tier right?And like maybe some other new employee is, like in a, you know on a lower tier in the company. Either way go ahead and look at the expansion section guys. So Ella uses the word here to talk about what they're going to eat first?

# 12.full treatment & in for a treat [phr.被款待]
> 1)So when you get the full treatment, and sometimes we might say special treatment, but it just means like you kind of get everything.so like basically what she means here is that she's having the starters, she's having all the different food, and the awesome tea. So she's getting the full British afternoon tea experience.It just like, it means you get everything from A to Z. So one example we have, "Those VIP tickets really allowed us to receive the full treatment at the event." Or "On her birthday, I took Judy to a SPA where she got the full treatment." So she didn't just get her feet you know down, she got her back, her hands, everything.

- 1. on her birthday,I took Judy to a spa where she got the full treatment.[好好享受一番]

- 2. Those VIP tickets really allowed us to receive the full treatment at the event.

- 3. Rob will have to undergo full medical treatment to beat the disease.[全面治疗]

> 2)‘in for a treat’ means, you are about to be very happy.It's going to be a treat for her, it's going to be a really really happy experience that will make her satisfied. "Well you're in for a treat."

# 13.proper [adj.体面讲究的，合乎体统的]
> 1)“proper" is kind of we might also say fiting in the way. So it means like correct. One example we have here in the expansion section is "This is not the proper climate to grow bananas." So you can't grow bananas here, it won't work.It's not proper, right? 

> 2)But proper can like you said, so it can also just be like authentic. I feel like this is a word people use and British English much more than American English. You might say like "He's a, he's a proper fellow."

# 14.customs /'kʌstəmz/ [n.习俗、传统] & tradition  /trə'dɪʃən/ [n. 传统]
> 1)Right, and then so maybe by celebrating the holiday that way you have certain little customs. I kind of feel like tradition is bigger than customs.Yeah I feel like custom is like something that you're used to doing or it's used to being this way. While tradition is much more formal.Yeah I feel like custom is like something that you're used to doing or it's used to being this way. While tradition is much more formal.

> 2)tradition has more like, for example you might say, "Oh, it's my custom to make a cake this way." But you might not say, "It's my tradition to make a cake this way." "Tradition" is more like maybe like society or something like...Okay, or like tradition could be like, a holiday could be a tradition.Right, we also say family tradition.Oh, it's our family tradition that we celebrate the holiday this way.

## 1)Sliced bread [吐司面包] & Toast [烤面包片]
> This is the bread that has already been cut and you usually make toast with it. Typically, you have white bread, whole wheat bread which is brown, and rye /raɪ/ bread [n.黑面包] which is dark brown.

## 2）Baguette /bæɡˈet/ [法棍] & Paris Baguette [巴黎贝甜]
> Baguettes are your classic French loaves. They are very long and unsliced. Since it’s a French word, the pronunciation is a little tricky. It sounds like “bag” and “get” together. The “u” is silent. 

## 3)Croissant /kwɑːˈsɑ̃ː/ /[krəˈsɑnt/：[可颂] 
> It’s also another type of French bread,It’s a very buttery roll and can be sweet or salty. I know in Chinese, a croissant is called a “goat’s horn” because of its shape.It’s [krəˈsɑnt]. Note you don’t pronounce the “i”. Let’s hear it a few more times: “croissant.” The French will pronounce it differently, but this is what it sounds like in English.

## 4)Brioche /briˈɔʃ/ [布里欧修]
> Brioche is also very tricky to pronounce! It is a light and soft French bun. But, the “ch” at the end actually becomes an “sh” sound because there is an “e” at the end. So, slowly it is [bri-ɔʃ] and quickly again it’s [briˈɔʃ].

## 5)ciabatta /chəˈbätə/ [夏巴塔]
> It’s used a lot for sandwiches. With Italian, the “c” is often pronounced [ch]. ciabatta is [chəˈbätə].

## 6)Foaccia /fə-'kä-chə/ [佛卡恰] 
> It's a bread with a lot of herbs and sometimes cheese. It's great in paninis and is at most Italian restaurants. The word actually has 3 "c's." The first one is pronounced like a "k" and the double 'c' in the back sounds like a "ch." It's a little confusing but just remember the sound, [fə-'kä-chə].

## 7)dinner/bread rolls /roʊlz/ 配餐面包
> These are small buns that you usually eat with a meal like soup or stew. There are many different types like white, whole wheat and multigrain [杂粮].

## 8）Sourdough /sau̇(-ə)r-ˌdō/ [酸面团面包]
> Sourdough is a loaf with a sour taste and it’s often served before a meal. Note that the “gh” at the end is actually silent. So, make the “o” longer and say [sau̇(-ə)r-ˌdō]. San Francisco is famous for its sourdough.

## 9)Bagels /beɪdʒəl/ /beɪgəl/ [硬面包圈；百吉饼；贝果面包] & Donut /ˈdoʊnʌt/ [甜甜圈]
> This is the signature breakfast bread in New York. But, it actually comes from the Jewish community in Poland. Bagels look like doughnuts but they are not deep fried and covered in sugar. It’s pronounced [beɪgəl], not [beɪdʒəl]. The best way to enjoy a bagel is with cream cheese.

## 10) pretzel /prɛtzəl/ [蝴蝶脆饼]
> Pretzels are twisted and look like hearts. Most importantly, they are very salty! They are very popular at food stands and are best eaten with some yellow mustard. When you say pretzel, break it into two syllables, [prɛt] and [zəl],  [prɛtzəl].

## 11)Pastry /ˈpeɪstri/：油酥面团；油酥面皮；油酥糕点   

## 12)scones /skɒns/ or /skəʊns/ [n. 司康饼] 
> This two pronunciations for this word. My family say /skɒn/.It's like a lightly sweetened, it's kind of like a very sort of dense thick cake, hard to describe unless you've had one or seen one. It's similar to what you guys you call biscuits.Yeah, but here a scone is, it's more sweet.it's almost kind of like a little cake almost.

## 13)biscuit & muffins /ˈmʌfɪnz/ 松饼
> in America we have these things called biscuits and they're, they're kind of like a type of bread. They're round, they're kind of like you said thick, but the ones in America are usually kind of salty or savory.Yeah, you eat them with a meal
