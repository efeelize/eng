# Cake_Barkey
# I.Birthday cakes in America
> Do you like eating cakes? Let's talk for a bit about where to actually buy a birthday cake in America. Now before you go saying "bakery", keep in mind that for many people living in towns or smaller cities, the bakery is just another part of the supermarket. Cakes at the supermarket aren't always fresh, and they contain a lot of artificial ingredients [人工成分]. For those people lucky enough to have a local bakery, usually the cakes will be made using more natural ingredients.

> Of course, many people choose to bake the cakes at home themselves. They could make the cake "from scratch"[从零开始], meaning that you start with only the basic ingredients, or they could bake it from a cake mix [盒装现成的材料]. Cake mixes come in all kinds of flavors and are very convenient. Usually you just have to add water and an egg, or just water. The downside [缺点] is that many of these mixes contain the same artificial ingredients as the cakes found in the supermarket bakeries.

> Usually for birthday cakes, chocolate or vanilla /və'nɪlə/ flavor is used. You might even see a marble /'mɑrbl/ cake [大理石蛋糕], which is basically a mix of the two. While you might see someone blow out candles on a cheesecake, you're unlikely to see other popular cake flavors, such as carrot or rum, act as a birthday cake.

# II.Bakeries in the US and China
> Places across the globe each have their own baking traditions, which means they each also have their own unique bakeries. Some bakeries more commonly sell certain types of treats [特定的点心] while others can offer a wide variety of sweets, savory /ˈsevəri/ [美味的] breads, and more. Today we will have a look at what bakeries look like in the US and China.

> There are lots of pastries /'peistriz/ [n.甜点] available in US bakeries. Throughout the US, you can find bakeries especially in many regional and international cuisines /kwɪˈzin/ [n.国际美食店]. But when it comes to typical American baked goods, most shops sell treats such as cookies, brownies, and cupcakes. Macarons, hybrid /'haɪbrɪd/ creations [混合甜品], like cronuts, and regional desserts like whoopie pies [巧克力派] are also popular.

> The first time you walk into a Chinese bakery is a little like stepping into Willy Wonka's factory [巧克力工厂]. Buns come with dozens of fillings [馅料五花八门]. Chinese bakeries are known for selling flavorful buns filled with everything from roast pork (char siu) [叉烧] to purple yam /jæm/ [紫薯]. Hong Kong egg tarts [香港蛋挞] and sesame balls [芝麻球] are also common.

> 1)dough, so it's kind of that gooey /'ɡui/ [n.胶状物], soft texture thing that you used to bake.Before you have a cookie, you need to have a cookie dough, or any kind of pizza dough, pie dough. I guess pie dough is crust,before you cook it.

> 2)Sourdough is a loaf with a sour taste and it’s often served before a meal. Note that the “gh” at the end is actually silent. So, make the “o” longer and say [sau̇(-ə)r-ˌdō]. San Francisco is famous for its sourdough.

## 9)Bagels /beɪdʒəl/ /beɪgəl/ [硬面包圈；百吉饼；贝果面包] & Donut /ˈdoʊnʌt/ [甜甜圈]

> 2)so multi means many many different kinds and grain is like the seed or the plant used for making cereal, bread, muffins, oatmeal.So multi grain is considered a little healthier, because it's made from many different grains and many different seeds.

## 16)Pancakes & waffles 
> 1)Pancakes:it's very basic brunch items,usually drizzled /'drɪzl/ with [滴上] maple syrup/'sɪrəp/ [枫糖浆] and topped with a slice of butter or two, pancakes are not the healthiest breakfast option, nor the easiest to prepare. Pancake batter /'bætɚ/ [面糊] is usually mixed the morning of, but there are frozen options [冰冻面糊] for those who don't have the time to make fresh pancakes.

> 3)so a carton /'kɑrtn/ [n.箱] of eggs has twelve eggs inside and we call that a dozen.
