# Fruit & Smoothies
# I.Fruit consumption in the U.S.
> The announcement that two Brazilian companies bought Chiquita Brands International, known for its bananas, in a deal worth $1.3 billion, certainly demonstrated one thing: there’s big money in fruit. And it’s only getting bigger.

> In 2004, fruit was the fifth most popular food item consumed by Americans, according to Harry Balzer, a chief industry analyst who studies food trends for NPD Group. Today, the category is now in second place [水果目前已位列第二], taking over the spot once occupied by soft drinks [取代了曾排在第二名的软饮料]. (Sandwiches have long been in first place.)

> Americans’ growing health consciousness [健康意识] is partly responsible for fruit’s ascent. There is also the convenience factor [便捷性也是要考虑的因素]. “It requires no cooking. It can be part of breakfast, lunch, or dinner,” Balzer says.

> Grocery stores are devoting more space to produce. Sherry Frey, senior vice president of Nielsen Perishables Group, says: “When you look at the entire store, one of the best growing departments is produce."

***This is so neat, Grace. I’ve never used an app to buy fruit before. So what should we get?***

***Start with the easy stuff. Add a few apples and bananas to the cart.***

***Okay. How about one of these grapefruits?***

***Those aren’t grapefruits, Liam. They are pomelos. They’re a bit less bitter.***

***Well I’m down to try one. Hey it looks like they have both tangerines and clementines. Which would you prefer?***

***These clementines are seedless so let’s get those. I don’t want to have to spit out or choke on any seeds.***

***Done. Oooh these berries look good too. We could put them in our smoothies!***

***Let’s pass on them this time. They’re way too expensive. Besides, our freezer is so full of that frozen strawberry and blueberry blend you bought at the supermarket.***

***No problem. Hey wait a second, why do they have tomatoes in a fruit store?***

***Well first of all, the tomato is technically a fruit. Second of all, those aren’t tomatoes, those are persimmons.***

***I had no idea that there were so many fruits I didn’t know.***

***Well that’s why you have me. It’s like they say, two heads are better than one!***

# V.pattern
***Hi, what kind of smoothie can I get you today?***

***Hm. I haven’t had breakfast, so I’m looking for something filling.***

***in that case, I’d recommend PB &amp; chocolate, blueberry açaí, or banana.***

***PB & chocolate sounds tasty. I’ll take one of those.***

***Would you like any protein or boosts or maybe yogurt?***

***Yes, I’d like chia seeds and whey protein powder instead of chocolate.***

***Sorry, we’re out of chia seeds. Would hemp seeds work?***

***Sure. No problem.***

***Ok. Coming right up.***

# IV.patten
***What kind of juice do you want?***

***I always get the pear and apple blend.***

***Oh, they have the summer berry special. That looks refreshing!***

***Blueberries, raspberries and blackberries, mixed together with yogurt.***

***That sounds more like a smoothie than juice!***

***Yeah I guess so. Anyway, I’m going to try it. Are you sure you’re sticking to the same old thing?***

***Maybe I should try something new too. Pineapple and papaya looks nice.***
