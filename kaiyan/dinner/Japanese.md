# 6.teriyaki [日式照烧，照烧鸡] & teriyaki bowls [照烧碗] & teriyaki burgers [照烧汉堡]
> 1)Teriyaki is one of Japan's traditional dishes, but it has become more popular in the U.S. than in Japan. In North America, any dish made with a teriyaki-like sauce (often even those using foreign alternatives to sake or mirin, such as wine), or with added ingredients, such as sesame or garlic (uncommon in traditional Japanese cuisine), is described as teriyaki.

> 2)Actually, Teriyaki is not the name of food, and it doesn't always have to be chicken. Fish – yellowtail [黄尾金枪鱼], marlin  /'mɑrlɪn/ [n.枪鱼], skipjack tuna [[鲣鱼]], salmon, trout /traʊt/ [鳟鱼], and mackerel /'mækrəl/ [鲭鱼]– is mainly used in Japan, while white and red meat – chicken, pork, lamb, and beef – is more often used in the West. You can often get teriyaki bowls with rice and vegetables, which is a healthy alternative to hamburgers. Some restaurants also have teriyaki burgers on their menus.

# 7.Sushi & California roll /ˌkæləˈfɔrnjə roʊl/ [加州卷] & Sushirrito [寿司玉米煎饼]
> 1)Sushi and California rolls are two different things. This is what authentic Sushi should look like. No cream cheese, no avocado and definitely nothing crunchy /'krʌntʃi/ in or around it,It should just be rice and raw fish.Most of the time, Japanese Sushi chefs put wasabi /ˈwɑsəbi/ [芥末] between rice and the fish and dried seaweed (called nori) around them to keep the rolls together.

> 2)A California roll has rice on the outside and usually has other things like avocado, sauce, and sesame seeds on top.

> 3)You can even get something named Sushirrito, which is a combination of Sushi and burrito /bə'rito/ [n.墨西哥卷].
