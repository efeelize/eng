***I'm so glad we got here early. This is the hottest brunch spot in town. Did you guys see the line-up?***

***Well I guess we're all a little older now. We can't sleep in like we used to!***

***Anyway, it's really great to see you guys. We really need to get together more often.***

***Totally. What’s everyone having? I’m going to have the eggs benedict with smoked salmon.***

***I’ll have the truffle omelet. I heard it’s to die for. What about you Lisa?***

***I still haven’t made up my mind. Just give me a sec. What are you guys drinking?***

***Bloody Mary for me.***

***Same here. Oh, and coffee. It's bottomless. Perfect for a 3 hour-brunch.***

***I know I'm gonna have a Mimosa to drink. But I can't decide whether I should have the ricotta pancakes or waffles with candied walnuts. They both look yum.***

***Why don’t you go with the pancakes? They sound like they’ll go well with the Mimosa.***

***Yeah, and they are light so you’ll have room for more Mimosa. Oh we should also get some hash browns to share.***

***Great idea! Let’s order!***

***Hi, what can I get for you today?***

***Hi, do you have any brunch specials?***

***We have a few. There’s a free range egg omelet with ham and spinach.***

***Hmm, I'm not big on ham. What else do you have?***

***We also have scrambled eggs with hashbrowns.***

***Um, anything else?***

***What about two eggs sunny side up on avocado toast?***

***I prefer my eggs over easy. Do you have any frittatas on the menu?***

***We do, but we’re sold out for today.***

***Oh. Any other specials?***

***There's also a classic Eggs Benedict.***

***Ok, I’ll have the Eggs Benny.***

***How do you like your eggs - soft or hard poached?***

***Hard, please. I don't like runny yolks.***

***Coming right up!***
