# II.The brunch culture
> The word brunch combines "breakfast" and "lunch". It started in 19th century England, but over the past 100 years, it has become very popular in North America as well. Originally, brunch was enjoyed by people coming home from church on Sunday morning. Over time, people who didn’t go to church started to enjoy it. 

> Generally speaking, brunch fans love two things about brunch: one, it allows people to sleep in. Two, it allows people to drink at lunchtime. What’s not to love? Many enjoy getting together with friends or family over a long brunch. Many restaurants seizing on the new opportunity have started to offer gourmet brunch dishes, such as the truffle omelet we learned in today's lesson.

***I'm so glad we got here early. This is the hottest brunch spot in town. Did you guys see the line-up?***

***Well I guess we're all a little older now. We can't sleep in like we used to!***

***Anyway, it's really great to see you guys. We really need to get together more often.***

***Totally. What’s everyone having? I’m going to have the eggs benedict with smoked salmon.***

***I’ll have the truffle omelet. I heard it’s to die for. What about you Lisa?***

***I still haven’t made up my mind. Just give me a sec. What are you guys drinking?***

***Bloody Mary for me.***

***Same here. Oh, and coffee. It's bottomless. Perfect for a 3 hour-brunch.***

***I know I'm gonna have a Mimosa to drink. But I can't decide whether I should have the ricotta pancakes or waffles with candied walnuts. They both look yum.***

***Why don’t you go with the pancakes? They sound like they’ll go well with the Mimosa.***

***Yeah, and they are light so you’ll have room for more Mimosa. Oh we should also get some hash browns to share.***

***Great idea! Let’s order!***

***Oh. Any other specials?***

***There's also a classic Eggs Benedict.***

***Ok, I’ll have the Eggs Benny.***
