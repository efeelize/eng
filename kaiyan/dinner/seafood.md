# I.small lobsters in America 
> China isn't the only country where small lobsters are eaten. They are also extremely popular in America, where they are called "crawfish /'krɔ'fɪʃ/ " or "crayfish /'kre'fɪʃ/". They are usually boiled, fried and sauteed /'səutei/ [vt.炒] in kitchens and restaurants from coast to coast[全国各地].

> Native Americans[土著印第安人] have been eating crawfish for centuries. After the arrival of the Europeans, French culture began to mix with the local culture in places like Louisana: the result was Cajun cooking[卡真料理], which you will discover if you ever go to New Orleans. One of the most famous Cajun dishes is gumbo, as we've seen in the dialogue. It's a stew using crawfish and okra /'okrə/ [n.秋葵] as its main ingredients.

> Of course, you will also find crawfish in other cities across America. And with more and more Chinese people coming to the United States, you are just as likely to eat Chinese-style crawfish as Cajun-style. 

> No matter if you are eating crawfish in New Orleans or small lobsters in Shanghai, be sure to wear a bib /bɪb/ [n.围裙], or at least have a bunch of paper towels nearby: It's definitely a fun meal to eat, but it sure can be messy!
