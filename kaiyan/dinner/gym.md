# Gym
# I.Booming fitness industry in the U.S.
> Currently about 20% of American adults have a fitness club membership, a number that is expected to increase continuously, even double in the next 10–15 years. Many employers and insurers now cover the costs of a health club membership [健身俱乐部会员费] or studio classes [工作室课程费用], as long as an employee can show they actually use them.

> Boutique /bu'tik/ fitness studios [精品健身工作室]  and “high-value, low-price” (HVLP) health clubs are the main forces [主力军] contributing to the recent boom of the fitness industry. HVLP gyms are attracting members thanks to inexpensive memberships [会员费低] —typically in the $10–$20 per-month range. This category usually offers a large club with a greater variety of fitness equipment [健身器材], group fitness classes [团体健身课程], small group training [小组训练] and personal training [个人训练]. Boutique studios are generally on the higher end pricewise /'praɪswaɪz/ [adv.就物价而论], ranging from $20–$50 a class, or $150–$200 month. Selling points [卖点] for these are the central locations, the specialization, the friendship fostered by the smaller, more quaint /kwent/ [古雅] environment. 

# 1.HIIT (High-intensity interval training)
> HIIT has been around for a couple of years and is still at the top for popularity. HIIT workouts focus on short and intense movements to help you burn the maximum amount of calories.

# 2.Wearable Technology
> Cnet News has called Apple Watch Series 3 the best wearable tech device this season. As a smartwatch and fitness tracker, it allows you to make calls, plays music and tracks activity.

# II.exercise your gym english
> Did you work out this week? Whether we're 15 or 50, we all need to do some exercise.

# 1.most people go to the gym to lose weight
> A great way to do this is by doing cardio /'kɑ:diəu/ [n.有氧运动].This includes going on a treadmill /'trɛdmɪl/ [n.跑步机] or an exercise bike [动感单车]. These machines have different levels of difficulty.About 25-30 minutes a day on one of these machines should be enough to lose weight.

# 2. Another reason to hit the gym is to get fit, or get in shape.
> This is when you make yourself strong and athletic looking.Push-ups [俯卧撑] and sit-ups [仰卧起坐] are an excellent way to do this without any equipment.Try to do about 100 push-ups and sit-ups a day. As you get stronger, increase that number to 150 or 200.don't forget to warm up [phr.热身] before you start. This is some light exercise [n.轻度锻炼] or stretching [n.拉伸] that prepares you for your workout.

# 3. Finally, some of us just want to bulk up [增肌].
> This is when you gain a lot of muscle, like The Hulk.A great way to bulk up is by doing a lot of reps [重复次数] with heavy weights [哑铃]. "Reps" is short for "repetition," and it's the number of times you do the same exercise.Doing five reps with a heavy weight, four or five times a day, will help you bulk up in no time [phr.立刻、很快].

# III.grammar
# 1.to be looking to do something [phr.想要做某事]
> 1)‘To be looking to do something’is an expression that can be used to show someone’s intention.But you're not, you're not like 100 percent going to do it. You're still kind of finding a way to do it. The verb that follows the expression is most commonly used in the present continuous or past continuous. If a person says “I am looking to lose some weight,”he/she means that he/she wants to lose some weight. In other words, it shows the person’s goals.

> 2)However, be careful not to confuse this with "to look to someone." For example, in the sentences "They looked to their teacher for help" and "She looked to her boyfriend for support," the phrase "look to" shows that the subjestes are looking at a specific person because they want help from them.

- 1. I went to Japan because I was looking to improve my Japanese. 

- 2. Are you looking to develop your skills and get a job? 

- 3. They weren’t looking to leave any time soon.  

- 4. The fans looked to gain entry to the stadium.

# 2.watch my waistline /weɪstlaɪn/ & figure [注意我的腰线/身材] & weight control /weɪt kənˈtroʊl/ 体重控制 & no shortcuts to [没有捷径]
> 1)watch my waistline,so men tends to use this phrase.

> 2)women often say,I'm watching my figure.

> 3)so "shortcut" is just a way to do something faster.like get to the library faster. But in this case, we're not talking about going to the library or something. We're talking about making something easier.so a shortcut could be something in the physical world or it can be something in life. Like we always get the question, "What is a shortcut to speaking better English?"There are no shortcuts, guys. You have to work hard in life. You have to work hard for what you want and if what you want is a strong immune system, there are no shortcuts there either.So you don't have to go to the gym every day, but you have to be at least a little bit active.Just move around.

# 3.lose some weight [phr.减肥] & get/be fit & get in shape [塑型] & be out of shape [长胖了] & get ripped /rɪpt/ [练出肌肉块、健美、很壮]
> 1)lose weight here. Just be careful, we don't really say "lose my weight" or "lose their weight". we just say lose weight.Often we say some or we can give the exact amount, like I lost five pounds or I lost five kilograms.

> 2)get fit means to be in good physical shape or condition.It not just muscles, but also like you're eating healthy food.And you can also use the "be" word. You can say I am fit or I was fit.get in shape is exact meaning.

> 3)the opposite of be fit would be out of shape.I'm actually feeling a little bit out of shape by myself.

> 4)It's kind of strange rip /rɪp/ [n.裂口], like you're tearing or ripping some paper. This just means you have lots of muscles, you have big strong muscles, and you can see your six pack. It's, it's like your skin is being ripped.And the muscles are coming out and you can see all of them.so sometimes it looks good and sometimes it's too much.for sure. I've seen some guys at the gym and they're pretty ripped.actually there's a lot of elderly people at my gym that are very ripped.

# 4.pack on + a few pounds/some muscle [n.重了几磅/有了肌肉] & handle love handles /ˈhændəlz/ & lose a spare tire /ˈtaɪər/ [phr.减掉游泳圈] & beer belly /ˈbɛli/ [啤酒肚] & chubby /ˈʧʌbi/ [胖乎乎的，圆胖的] 
> if you think packing, like packing your, your luggage when you're going on a, you know, on a trip. It's kind of the same idea you're putting extra things on to your body.And more positive sense though, you could say that I packed on some muscle.

# 5.could use [巴不得] & I could use a break & fair enough/that's fair [我明白、有道理] 
> 1)I could use, as like useful for me, and we say this when we're giving a hint about something. like you said could be helpful for us, like we often say this, I could use a hand and that means that I would really appreciate someone helping me.we could also say I could use a break,so I want a break.

> 2)Fair enough. this is just another expression that you could use to say that's true, I see.It's like when you admit that the other person, has a point or is correct about something. Even though they maybe, they disagree, but or they have different opinions, but like ok, your opinion is..." You know, like you said called true. you could also say that's fair, instead of fair enough.

# 7.sign up [报名] let it go to waste [让它白白浪费] & gym guy  [喜欢健身的人] & gym rat /ræt/ [健身迷，健身狂]
> 1)sign up means join.you can sign up for a class, you could sign up for a gym membership, or let's say, you can sign up for a team sport.it's usually for like a club or some kind of event, It's not just, if your friends are going to the pub and you want to, you don't say sign up.

> 2)letting it go to waste, you can kind of imagine this as when you, let's say, buy something, you leave it on the table and then you never touch it again.you already paid the money for the membership, but you didn't use it.You let it expire.

> 3)you could say gym guy, gym girl, gym person, but we don't really say gym man or gym woman.It just means he doesn't like the gym. You can use this for, like things you're interested in, even like movies. I'm not a romance person.Or you could say I'm not a fiction person.

# 8.hitting the gym [去健身房] & working out [v. & n.健身，锻炼] & coach/personal trainer [私人教练] & to pay off/paying off [phr.取得效果]
> 1)So, workout can be a noun and a verb. to "work out" means to exercise.This is a verb, but it could also be a noun. for example, maybe I worked out in the morning and then I say to my friend, "I had a really tough workout this morning."So you're explaining what type of workout you had. 

> 2)Personal trainer. A "trainer",we also say "coach" sometimes. They tell you what to do. "One more push-up [n.俯卧撑], one more sit-up [n.仰卧起坐], one more, one more." But here, we have this word personal, and here this means it's your trainer—he or she, when they are training you, it's just one on one.It's not a class. It's like your own teacher just for you.

> 3)to pay off or paying off. This is used very often to just describe, like, the results of your work.like if you work hard, you will get something like some kind of a benefit.

# 9.company &  accompany /ə'kʌmpəni/ & companion /kəm'pænɪən/ [n.陪伴]
> 1)she wants company, not a company which in this case just means friend.so you can kind of, think of this as companion.If you're sad, because maybe, you know you broke up with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you want your friends to come over and kind of cry with you, like "oh, I could, I could use, I got some company right now".

> 2)You can also say "Sorry, can I call you back? I have company over."It means there are people at your house or people with you.

# 10.lift weights [举重] & barbell /ˈbɑːrbel/ [杠铃] dumbbell /ˈdʌmbel/ [哑铃] & kettlebells [n.壶铃] & jogging /ˈdʒɑːɡɪŋ/ [慢跑]
> 1) "lift" ， It means to pick up, to pick something up. But we don't say pick up weights, we say lift weights. 

> 2)And there's different kinds of weights. We have barbells, Dumbbells. There's also other types of bells, kettlebells.

# 11.sth is about + n + or so [phr.大约]
> "Usually 3 to 4 times a week for about an hour or so."So a lot of times when you go to the gym, you lift weights. We could say, "This weighs about 40 kilos or so."basically there's this pattern: it's "about," then "something" and then "or so." For example, you say, "I'll be there at about 4:30. You can also say, "I will be there at about 4:30 or so."and that sounds like a native speaker.

# 12.coronavirus /kəˈroʊnəˌvaɪrəs/ [冠状病毒] & invincible [adj.不可战胜的] & immune system /ɪˈmjuːn ˌsɪstəm/ [免疫系统] & taking a toll on /toʊl/ [造成损失（或伤亡、破坏）] 
> 1)"Invincible" means that nothing can hurt it.It makes me think about Superman. Superman is invincible.But we are just little lowly humans and we are not invincible.We are certainly not invincible. We can be harmed.

> 2)immune system." This is the system in our body that protects us from disease like colds and all kinds of disease.

> 3)but we can use this word immune in lots of other circumstances or situations. Like, for example, "immune to criticism." That just means criticism doesn't hurt you."Okay, you can criticize me all you want."Maybe there's this really charming guy and all the girls love this guy. But maybe you are like, "Oh,  I'm immune to his charm. It doesn't infect me."

> 4)taking a toll on: This is a great phrase. It basically means to seriously, negatively affect someone.and it's often like slowly, over time, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. But over a long time, it's really big.So if you are always feeling stressed, if you have a lot of stress in your life, it's not going to take one day for you to become unhealthy. It's going to slowly and slowly add up. the stress at work is taking a toll on other parts of my life for example. It takes a toll on me, takes a toll on my health, takes a toll on my marriage.

***Hey, Kevin, do you know of any good personal trainers?***

***I might. Why? Are you trying to lose some weight or are you just trying to get fit?***

***Really? It's impossible for me to stick to any diet. Besides, I think you still need to combine it with exercise.***

***Yea, but I feel like a hamster on a wheel at the gym. Also, I’m not really looking to get ripped.***
