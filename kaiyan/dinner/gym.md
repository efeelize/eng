# II.grammar
# 1.To be looking to do something
>‘To be looking to do something’is an expression that can be used to show someone’s intention. The verb that follows the expression is most commonly used in the present continuous or past continuous. If a person says “I am looking to lose some weight,”he/she means that he/she wants to lose some weight. In other words, it shows the person’s goals.

> However, be careful not to confuse this with "to look to someone." For example, in the sentences "They looked to their teacher for help" and "She looked to her boyfriend for support," the phrase "look to" shows that the subjestes are looking at a specific person because they want help from them.

- 1. I went to Japan because I was looking to improve my Japanese. 

- 2. Are you looking to develop your skills and get a job? 

- 3. They weren’t looking to leave any time soon.  

- 4. The fans looked to gain entry to the stadium.

> 1)watch my waistline,so men tends to use this phrase.

> 2)women often say,I'm watching my figure.


> so "shortcut" is just a way to do something faster.like get to the library faster. But in this case, we're not talking about going to the library or something. We're talking about making something easier.so a shortcut could be something in the physical world or it can be something in life. Like we always get the question, "What is a shortcut to speaking better English?"There are no shortcuts, guys. You have to work hard in life. You have to work hard for what you want and if what you want is a strong immune system, there are no shortcuts there either.

> 1)"Invincible" means that nothing can hurt it.It makes me think about Superman. Superman is invincible.But we are just little lowly humans and we are not invincible.We are certainly not invincible. We can be harmed.

> 2)immune system." This is the system in our body that protects us from disease like colds and all kinds of disease.

> 3)but we can use this word immune in lots of other circumstances or situations. Like, for example, "immune to criticism." That just means criticism doesn't hurt you."Okay, you can criticize me all you want."Maybe there's this really charming guy and all the girls love this guy. But maybe you are like, "Oh,  I'm immune to his charm. It doesn't infect me."

> 4)taking a toll on: This is a great phrase. It basically means to seriously, negatively affect someone.and it's often like slowly, over time, a little bit, a little bit, a little bit. But over a long time, it's really big.So if you are always feeling stressed, if you have a lot of stress in your life, it's not going to take one day for you to become unhealthy. It's going to slowly and slowly add up. the stress at work is taking a toll on other parts of my life for example. It takes a toll on me, takes a toll on my health, takes a toll on my marriage.

***Hey, Kevin, do you know of any good personal trainers?***

***I might. Why? Are you trying to lose some weight or are you just trying to get fit?***

***A bit of both actually. I packed on a few pounds over the holidays and I’m starting to develop some love handles. So, I figured now would be a good time to drop a few pounds and get in shape for the summer.***

***I know exactly how you feel! I’ve actually been trying to lose a spare tire myself. All this drinking is giving me a beer belly!***

***Do you want to sign up for the gym together?***

***Mmm…I don’t know… The last time I bought a membership, I let it go to waste. I’m just not a gym guy. I think I’ll just try to go on a diet and see how it goes.***

***Really? It's impossible for me to stick to any diet. Besides, I think you still need to combine it with exercise.***

***Yea, but I feel like a hamster on a wheel at the gym. Also, I’m not really looking to get ripped.***

***Ok! Fair enough! Well, if you ever change your mind, let me know. I could use the company!***
