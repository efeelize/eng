# Complaining at the restaurant
# I.The right way to complain at a restaurant
> In a perfect world, every restaurant reservation [预留] would be seated exactly on time and every steak would arrive precisely cooked to temperature[烹饪得恰到好处]. But when you dine out[出去吃饭], often and inevitably you’ll find cause for complaint. Here's how to complain at a restaurant:

# 1. Know when to speak up
> Though it's not always possible, the best time to complain is as soon as possible, while you’re still at the restaurant and while the offending dish [不满意的菜品] is still in front of you. Additionally, you should evaluate [衡量] whether your problem is truly worthy[值得] of complaining about.

# 2.Be polite
> If the need to complain arises, flag down [拦下了] your server or a manager and calmly explain the issue. A good place to start is: “Excuse me, but my...is overcooked [糊了] / too salty / inedibly spicy.[辣到不能吃]”

# 3.Be specific about a resolution, if you have one in mind
> If you have a specific idea about what would resolve the situation to your liking (within reason!), feel free to say it. The manager may not necessarily be able to give you exactly what you want[尽管经理或许不能完全按你说的做], but if it’s within their power[只要不超出他们的能力范围], they probably will. It’s in their best interest that you leave satisfied.

# II.grammar
# 1.should & if 
> In today’s lesson, the restaurant manager tells his unhappy customers that he will give them a coupon to use, “should” they decide to come back.

> “Should” here is not related to “must”, as in “you should go”. Rather, it is much more related to “if”. He could have said “if you decide to come back”, but “should” sounds much more polite and formal.[这儿的“Should”并不太像“must”的意思，和“you should go”（你应该去）中的用法不一样。而更像“if”的意 思。餐厅经理本可以说“if you decide to come back”（如果您决定还回来的话），但是“should”听起来会更加礼 貌正式。]

> This is a great word to use when you are talking to your clients or customers, or other times when you need to be a bit more formal.[当你在和客户或者顾客交流时，或者是你在稍显正式的场合，“should”是一个很好用的词。]

***Where do I begin? First of all, our food took forever!***

***Oh I'm terribly sorry to hear that. I'm afraid we're a bit short-staffed today.***

***Well, that's no excuse for the server's rude behavior. She needs an attitude adjustment!***

***Okay, I'll be sure to let her know. Is there anything else that is not meeting expectations?***

***My deepest apologies, sir. They are really swamped in the kitchen tonight and must have forgotten.***

***Well, to make matters worse, look what we found swimming in my wife's soup! A hair!***

***Oh dear. Sir, we pride ourselves on keeping a clean and hygienic kitchen, but of course these things happen from time to time.***

***Well, they shouldn't! I'm afraid that in the future we might have to take our business elsewhere!***

***I completely understand. As an apology, tonight's meal is on the house.And we can give you a 20% off coupon for next time, should you decide to come back.***
