# III.type
# 1.sashimi platter /sashimi ˈplætər/ 刺身拼盘 & seafood platter/tower & sea urchin /ˈɜrʧən/ [海胆] 
> sea urchin. Now you may not have heard this word before you've seen them. I can guarantee you may have eaten it and it's it's like a small ball. But not too small you can fit it in your hand, but it's very spiky /'spaɪki/ [adj.很尖],and they're sharp too. It will hurt your hand if you touch it. it looks like it's a ball covered in needles.Usually brown and then you cut it open and inside is yellow.

# 2.Sushi & California roll /ˌkæləˈfɔrnjə roʊl/ [加州卷] & Sushirrito [寿司玉米煎饼]
> 1)Most of the time, Japanese Sushi chefs put wasabi /ˈwɑsəbi/ [芥末] between rice and the fish and dried seaweed (called nori) around them to keep the rolls together.it's usually a roll or some type of wrapped in nori /'nɔri/ [紫菜], and nori is the seaweed [海苔], the dried seaweed, which guys may snack on as a snack.

> 2)A California roll has rice on the outside and usually has other things like avocado, sauce, and sesame seeds on top.Sushi and California rolls are two different things. This is what authentic Sushi should look like. No cream cheese, no avocado and definitely nothing crunchy /'krʌntʃi/ in or around it,It should just be rice and raw fish.

> 3)There's two different stories here. There's the one where it was someone in California invented it. But this chef in Vancouver his name is Tojo. He's so cute, little Tojo. He is credited with inventing the California roll.so people believe that he invented the California roll, a chef from Vancouver.

> 4)You can even get something named Sushirrito, which is a combination of Sushi and burrito /bə'rito/ [n.墨西哥卷].

# 3.chawanmushi /chawanmushi/ [日式茶碗蒸] & Chinese steamed eggs [鸡蛋羹]
> literally "tea cup steam" or "steamed in a tea bowl") is an egg custard dish found in Japan. The recipe for the dish is similar to that of Chinese steamed eggs [鸡蛋羹], but the toppings may often differ. Since egg custard /'kʌstɚd/, along with soup, can't be picked up by chopsticks, it's one of the few Japanese dishes that are eaten with a spoon.

# 4.udon /u:,dɔn/ 乌冬面 
> udon and soba are like a Japanese soup noodles, And there's different kinds. Sometimes it has pork or beef or chicken or tofu or all of that.Udon is usually in a soup and udon is a thicker round noodle. Ah it's still made of flour.To me it tastes like it's made from rice flour, but it's wheat flour.

# 5.soba /səʊbə/ 荞麦面 & buckwheat /ˈbʌˌkwit/ 荞麦
> soba they're a little bit brown.Yeah they're kind of brown even a little bit grey at sometimes and they're made from buckwheat.So healthy if you can't eat wheat or bread or things like that. You can eat soba noodles.so if anyone is on a diet, soba is great for dieting.

# 6.mirin [日式味增] & teriyaki [日式照烧] &  & miso /miso/ soup [味增汤]
> 1)mirin is an essential condiment used in Japanese cuisine. It is a type of rice wine similar to sake, but with a lower alcohol content and higher sugar content. 

> 2)Teriyaki in Japanese is fried, and the teri fried things, from teriyaki, usually its mirin [日式味增].It has soy sauce, and usually a little bit of sugar.

> 3)miso soup, it's just fermented bean soup.it is delicious. It's a great pairing with some sushi. I always order sushi and miso soup on the side.

# 7.chicken teriyaki [照烧鸡] & teriyaki bowls [照烧碗] & teriyaki burgers [照烧汉堡]
> 2)it's one of Japan's traditional dishes, but it has become more popular in the U.S. than in Japan. In North America, any dish made with a teriyaki-like sauce (often even those using foreign alternatives to sake or mirin, such as wine), or with added ingredients, such as sesame or garlic (uncommon in traditional Japanese cuisine), is described as teriyaki.

> 3)Actually, Teriyaki is not the name of food, and it doesn't always have to be chicken. Fish – yellowtail [黄尾金枪鱼], marlin  /'mɑrlɪn/ [n.枪鱼], skipjack tuna [[鲣鱼]], salmon, trout /traʊt/ [鳟鱼], and mackerel /'mækrəl/ [鲭鱼]– is mainly used in Japan, while white and red meat – chicken, pork, lamb, and beef – is more often used in the West. You can often get teriyaki bowls with rice and vegetables, which is a healthy alternative to hamburgers. Some restaurants also have teriyaki burgers on their menus.
