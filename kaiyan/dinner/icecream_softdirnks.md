# I.Icecream
# 1.taste & flavor
> 1）Taste is how you feel, generally speaking.when you're talking about the the taste of a food, the only difference is we can also use taste to mean the thing that we do with our tongue.so if you want to try a flavor of ice cream, you could say, could I taste that flavor? you may taste something, and it has a certain taste to you, but to me it's different.for example, you may like the taste of spicy foods, I may not, so it tastes too strong for me or too hot.

> 2)So a flavor is the basic, strawberry, vanilla, chocolate. when you were talking about ice cream you want to use flavor.

# 2.type
## 1)gelato /dʒəˈlɑtoʊ/ [意式冰淇淋] & spumoni /spuː'məʊnɪ/ icecream [意式冰淇淋] 
> 1)Gelato is churned /tʃɝn/ [vt.搅拌] at a much slower rate, incorporating less air [混入的空气较少] and leaving the gelato denser [香浓] than ice cream. Gelato is served at a slightly warmer temperature than ice cream [温度没有那么冰], so its texture stays silkier and softer [更滑更软]. Because it has a lower percentage of fat than ice cream, the main flavor ingredient really shines through [主料风味就会更加明显].

> spumoni:This is very similar to Neapolitan, but instead of one of the flavors, it has pistachio /pɪ'stæʃɪo/ [n.开心果].

## 2)Neapolitan /ˌniəˈpɑlətən/ [三色冰淇淋（chocolate, vanilla, strawberry）]
> And everyone always eats the vanilla and the chocolate and then the strawberry usually gets left behind.

## 3)waffle cone /ˈwɑfəl koʊn/ [华夫卷筒，甜筒] & cup 
> 1)a cone is the bottom of the ice cream.You can eat the cone. Waffles.

> 2)Now you have a choice of how you want your scoop served, and the options are cup or waffle cone.so cup here, it's, you're not going to drink your ice cream.Unless you wait too long.It's like a small bowl almost, but we say cup because you, a bowl of ice cream is a lot of ice cream. 

## 4)frozen yogurt /ˈjoʊgərt/ 酸奶冰淇淋 & Frozen Desserts [冰冻甜品]
> rozen yogurt is exactly what it sounds like it's yogurt that has been frozen, so that it kind of cold, it's like ice cream, but it's made a little bit differently.it's a type of ice cream but it's usually a little bit more sour. It's not sweet. And I guess it's also healthier.in theory, it should be healthier. There's not sugar in it necessarily. That's why it became popular because it was healthier than ice cream.

## 5)Sorbet /'sɔbɛi/ [冰沙、果汁冰糕]
> Now, not everybody likes the heavier flavors for ice cream, because there is the milk in there, that can be a little bit too fatty.So sometimes people may be in the mood for something lighter, like a sorbet.it's like frozen fruit. And they're usually less creamy and more fruit flavored. Like mango sorbet.

## 6)toppings /ˈtɑpɪŋz/ 撒在食物上的配料 & sprinkles /ˈsprɪŋkəlz/ 小糖粒
> so it's kind of the additive little added bits or extras that you can put on top of something.

# 3.flavor
## 1)Cookies and cream flavour/ Oreo /'ɔ:riəu/ [曲奇奶油味]
> It's a very American ice cream flavor,and it probably popular all over the world.it's just little pieces of cookie, that are mixed with usually a vanilla ice cream or white creamy ice cream.so if you look at it. It's like white vanilla ice cream with little bits and pieces black cookies in it.Which I remember, when I was very young, learning that this is just Oreo, this is Oreo flavor.And usually Oreo cookies. If you say cookies and cream, people know you mean Oreo cookies smashed in with white ice cream.

## 2)Mint and choc chip flavour [薄荷巧克力脆片味]

## 3)salted caramel /ˈkɛrəməl/ [海盐焦糖]
> And it's basically brown sugar melted to form a chewy /'tʃui/ [adj.柔软而会黏着的] substance.'salted'it basically means salt is added. Sometimes I think, I've seen with a latte for example, like a salted caramel latte, it's just the salt is added to bring a little flavor, and yeah, you wouldn't use the word salty.

## 4)traditional flavors[传统口味]

## 5）blend /blɛnd/ [混合] & scoops /sku:p/ [n.勺]
> 1)it's basically a tool or the digging up of a ball of ice cream.Now I don't eat a lot of ice cream, but I drink a lot of coffee. So it's the same thing. I have a coffee scoop and I scoop the coffee into the machine.

> 2)There's no ball of ice cream is a scoop.It's a scoop.You can have a big scoop or a small scoop. It's a scoop.

## 6)Honey jalepeno pickle [墨西哥蜜汁胡椒泡菜味]

## 7)nutty /ˈnʌti/ 多坚果的 & Goat cheese cashew caramel [山羊奶酪腰果焦糖味]

## 8)Spaghetti and cheese [意大利面奶酪味]

## 9)cookie dough [n.曲奇面团]
> And people in the supermarket you can actually buy a tube of cookie dough ice cream, oh, sorry, cookie dough. And you, you know, especially if you've been out drinking maybe, you come home with a spoon, and your tube of cookie dough and you just go at it.

# II.popsicles /ˈpɑpsɪkəlz/ & Ice cream bar/[冰棒、雪糕] 
# 1.Popsicle /ˈpɑpsɪkəl/ [冰棒]
> So now technically, you can put ice cream on a stick,but we generally called all of those things on the stick a popsicle.they are all popsicles.

I used to always make popsicles, frozen juice,this no milk, no fat all these things, it's just juice.But some of them will have yogurt, I make them with yogurt.but basically fruit flavored juice kind of thing.

# 2.Doll head ice cream bar [雪人雪糕]

> 1)soda is kind of same as a soft drinks.in Canada,we used the word Pop.when I think about Soda is just soda water. No other flavor, it doesn't really have a taste, you just get the bubbles. It's very nice on a crazy hot day.

> 2)As the oldest major soft drink brand in America, it's no surprise Dr. Pepper [胡椒博士] made it on this list. The sweet and spicy soda is concocted with a proprietary [配方受专利保护] blend [混合] of 23 bold flavors. Coca-Cola has remained the top-seller in this category [可口可乐是苏打水销量冠军], while its classic cans are losing ground to its diet counterparts /'kaʊntɚpɑrt/ [经典口味的销量渐渐被健怡可乐超越].Coca-cola is produced and marketed in over 200 countries.

# 2.Ginger ale /el/ [姜味汽水] & Dr.pepper

In the U.S., it far outsells any other competitor [销量遥遥领先]. Schweppes and Seagrams are also among the Big Three companies of the classic ginger ale era, with the former tasting muted /ˈmjutɪd/ [平和] and the latter bolder.

> 2)Dr.pepper isn't taste like perpper or salt or anything.

# 3.Sparkling water
> This water is fizzy /'fɪzi/ [adj.嘶嘶的] with bubbles, like in sodas. Any type of water can be made into sparkling water. In restaurants, servers often ask if customers would like sparkling water or still water, which means no fizz.

> Hailing from the Italian Alps [意大利阿尔卑斯山脚], San Pellegrino [圣培露充气矿泉水] is a sparkling mineral water that adds as much effervescence /ˌefə'ves(ə)ns/ [n.冒泡] to your morning run as it can to your low-cal cocktails [泡沫丰富的低卡鸡尾酒]. LaCroix Sparkling Water is another popular choice, priding itself on having a lower carbon footprint /'fʊtprɪnt/ [该品牌气泡水产生的碳排放少] as well as including zero artificial sweeteners /'switn/ [不添加人工甜味剂], sugars, and sodium /'sodɪəm/ [钠].

# 4.Coke & Pepsi /'pepsi/ & Diet Coke /ˈdaɪət koʊk/ [健怡可乐]

## 2)Spring water [泉水]
> This type of water comes from springs, which are pools of water that are supplied by rainwater.

## 3)Mineral water [矿物质水]
> This water comes from the ground, so it contains healthy minerals like calcium /'kælsɪəm/ [n.钙]. Sometimes there are minerals that even give it a salty taste.

## 4）well water [井水]

## 5)purified water [纯净水]

## 6）Distilled water [蒸馏水]
> This type of water is treated to remove everything that isn't water, even minerals. All that's left is pure H2O. Strangely, people can actually get sick if they only drink distilled water because it has no minerals.

# 4.refreshing [adj.爽口的，提神的] & refreshed [adj.精神焕发的]
> 1)When you drink it, you feel less hot.

> 2)that's a really important thing to keep in mind. We never say "I feel refreshing".If it's a feeling, you say "refreshed".

# 5.ice cold [adj.冰镇的、很冰的] & chilled /ʧɪld/ [冰镇过的] & half ice [半冰]  & no ice [不加冰]
> 1)it's an adjective we often use for drinks when they're really cold, like ice cold beer.I don't like a lot of ice, but I like it as cold as ice.sometimes at the restaurant put in so much ice, you actually don't get very much coke.
