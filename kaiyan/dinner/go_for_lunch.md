# Where should I go for lunch
# I.New eating habits are killing the conventional lunch in America
> Once upon a time, when the clock struck noon[正午钟鸣], American workers would set aside [放下]their tools, sit down, and eat lunch - maybe a burger or a salad - possibly with a beer. But the halcyon /'hælsɪən/ [adj.平静的] days of lunch could soon be ending.[曾经闲适的午餐时光很快就要一去不复返了。]

> Lunch's largest existential /ˌɛɡzɪˈstɛnʃəl/ [adj.有关存在的] crisis is the millennials [千禧一代（指生于1982年到2000年的人群）] and Gen Z-ers [Z时代人群（指1990年代中叶至2000年后出生的人）] who are replacing the midday meal with snacks. There are now 12 billion [120亿] annual visits to restaurants and food-service outlets that amount to just a quick nibble /'nɪbl/ [很少量食物]. Instead of three-martini lunches[描绘商人和律师可以悠闲享受午餐的场景，他们有钱有闲，可以享受三杯马提尼，而不是一杯马提尼], younger consumers are opting for faster, cheaper alternatives like fresh fruit, yogurt, and chips.

> The majority of American office workers[白领], whatever they have for lunch, they probably dineal desko[在办公桌前解决]. Some 80% of employees don't take aregular lunch break. Rather, they cram /kræm/ in their calories solo[独自咀嚼午餐], and swiftly[看起来很凄凉]: on average it takes just 15 minutes to eat lunch. And while it may seemsad that so many of them are masticating /ˈmæstɪˌket/[v.咀嚼] alone, with only the glow of their screens for company, alot of people actually prefer it that way. In one study, a quarter of millennial employees agreed with the statement “I eat alone to multitask better.”[独自吃饭，可以同时解决多项任务]

# 1.feel like 
> feel like  is more about something we want to do. It’s commonly used when making a choice. Because of that, “feel like” is never followed by an adjective. Here is the pattern for “feel like.”

- 1. I feel like + SUBJECT [主语] + VERB + OBJECT[宾语] (I feel like I want pizza.) 
- 2. I feel like + NOUN (I feel like pizza.) 
- 3. I feel like + GERUND[动名词] + NOUN (I feel like eating pizza.) 
- 4. Most people don't feel like exercising every day. 
- 5. She said she feels like a romance movie, but I'd prefer action.

***Hey, Louise. Are you ordering in or going out for lunch?***

***Oh, I'm eating out but I've really got to eat and run. I've got a meeting after lunch.***

***If you're tight on time, let's just go to the cafeteria.***

***The cafeteria is kind of getting old. We could go to that fancy new place if you want. It's got great reviews.***

***Hmm, that sounds good, but won't it be packed?***

***Yeah, maybe. How about just grabbing a sandwich in the food court?***

***I feel like something more filling. Let's check the app.***

***Honestly, I'm fresh out of time. Can we just keep it simple?***
