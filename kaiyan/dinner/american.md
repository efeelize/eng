## 1）a large chicken deluxe and a medium Hawaiian. [夏威夷披萨] & supreme pizza [豪华披萨]
> 1)It's the deluxe. So it's got everything on it.Like mushrooms, chicken in all, it's got everything.so we also will use, use. For example, meat lovers deluxe, which is every kind of meat you can think of.So at some restaurants like Pizza Hut, they may call it as supreme pizza.

> 2)Hawaiian pizza:This is always ham and pineapple.you can say I would like a ham and pineapple, but Hawaiian means exactly the same thing.Every restaurant will have Hawaiian pizza and it means the same.You got a lot of that in big restaurants, but a lot of the gourmet sort of authentic pizza places don't always have Hawaiian because sometimes they don't think it's real pizza, real authentic Italian pizza.
