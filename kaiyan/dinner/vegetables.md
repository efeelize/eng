# 1.up to [phr.不亚于但不超过]
> At the salad bar in today's lesson we learned that a customer can choose up to five options. In this case, you can think of up to as meaning "as much as but not more than". So whatever number comes after up to is the maximum number allowed or possible. Back to the salad bar for a second: You can have up to five choices, meaning that two choices is okay [无论后面跟的数量是多少,这都是允许或可能的最大数], three choices is okay, even five choices is okay, but six choices? No way. That's exceeding the maximum!

- 1. The city announced that the road repairs could take up to two months.

- 2. You will have up to two hours to finish the test.

- 3. I worked right up to the last minute, and finally finished the report.

> 2)turkey,it's not a chicken,probably the cloest thing.But the turkey it's bigger than a chicken, usually, the meat also is a bit more dry, than the chicken.There's less fat in a turkey, so you have to cook it, a bit more carefully I think. Otherwise, it gets very dry. remember many Thanksgiving where I was thinking God, I need more gravy /'ɡrevi/ [n.肉汁] on this turkey because it's too dry,maybe more cranberry /'kræn'bɛri/ sauce [n.蔓越莓酱].

Like a pasta /'pɑstə/ [n.意大利面食] maybe something like that.

# III.pattern 
***This is the best salad bar in town. It has a wide range of choices.***

***Yeah, everything looks so fresh. What's good here?***

***Well, pretty much everything. You could either build your own salad or order off the menu.***

***What are you getting?***

***I usually build my own. They give you fresh greens as the base. You can then choose up to five options from the bar. Today I'm getting some asparagus, edamame, purple potatoes, quinoa, and chick peas.***

***All veggie? Can you choose any meat or seafood?***

***Yes. You can choose one. I'll get the grilled chicken breast. Do you know what you want to get?***

***I'm deciding between the mango and shrimp salad, and the smoked salmon and avocado salad.***

***They're both good. But the mango and shrimp salad has more interesting Southeast Asian flavors.***

***Sounds good. I’ll get that then.***
