# Vegetables & Salad 
# I.Dipping culture
> We North Americans love our dips, but it's not always easy to explain our love to people from other cultures. A dip is like a sauce, but it's much thicker. Then, you take some chips, crackers /'krækɚz/ [饼干], bread or vegetables and use them to eat the dip. this is knid of like a sauce,but it's a lot thicker in consistency and it usually has chunks of things.

> So the word "dip" is both the sauce and the action of eating the sauce. There are so many different kinds of dips: some, like spinach dip, are full of calories so you really should just have a little bit. Other, like hummous /ˈhʊməs/ [鹰嘴豆泥], salsa sɑlsə/ [辣调味汁] or guacamole /ˌɡwɑkəˈmoli/ [鳄梨酱] are actually pretty healthy. So feel free to dip as much as you like!

# 1.up to [phr.不亚于但不超过]
> At the salad bar in today's lesson we learned that a customer can choose up to five options. In this case, you can think of up to as meaning "as much as but not more than". So whatever number comes after up to is the maximum number allowed or possible. Back to the salad bar for a second: You can have up to five choices, meaning that two choices is okay [无论后面跟的数量是多少,这都是允许或可能的最大数], three choices is okay, even five choices is okay, but six choices? No way. That's exceeding the maximum!
