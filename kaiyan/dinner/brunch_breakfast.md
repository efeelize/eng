# Breakfast_Brunch
# I.Cereals and cartoon characters
> Cereal /'sɪrɪəl/ is a popular breakfast food because it is very easy and quick to prepare. Some kinds of cereal are pretty healthy, like Raisin /'rezn/ Bran [葡萄干麦片] or Special K [全麦维], while some are very unhealthy. If you think cereal is healthy, think again. Many popular types of breakfast cereal actually contain high amounts of sugar.

> The unhealthiest cereals usually have bright colors and a cartoon character on the box, so that children will want to eat them. For example, Fruit Loops (which has no real fruit) has a cartoon bird named Sam. One of the most popular brands of cereal, Frosted Flakes, has a tiger named Tony who always says "They're GRRRRReat!" Although healthier cereals usually don't use cartoon characters on their boxes, Rice Krispies has three characters, Snap, Crackle, and Pop, who are named after the sound the cereal makes when you add milk to it.

> Most children will have cereal with milk at least a few times a week. All you have to do is pour it into a bowl and add milk. Kids gobble /'ɡɑbl/ [vi.狼吞虎咽地吃] this up, since they usually contain a lot of added sugar and artificial flavoring. To compensate for this, many brands will add vitamins and minerals back to these highly refined and processed cereals.

# II.The brunch culture
> The word brunch combines "breakfast" and "lunch". It started in 19th century England, but over the past 100 years, it has become very popular in North America as well. Originally, brunch was enjoyed by people coming home from church on Sunday morning. Over time, people who didn’t go to church started to enjoy it. 

> Generally speaking, brunch fans love two things about brunch: one, it allows people to sleep in [睡懒觉]. Two, it allows people to drink at lunchtime. What’s not to love? Many enjoy getting together with friends or family over a long brunch. Many restaurants seizing [抓住] on the new opportunity have started to offer gourmet /'ɡʊrme/ brunch dishes, such as the truffle /'trʌfl/ omelet [松露口味蛋卷] .

And they have flex stuff in side of where is like the eggs benedict. The salmon will probably be like on top underneath eggs.

> 2)if you're super healthy, you're trying to be low fat, low cholesterol, you could get an egg white omelet.If you really wanted to get like a super healthy omelet, you could get a free range egg white omelet.

> 3)frittatas : it's actually baked in the oven with other stuff like spinach, A frittata is typically open-faced [正面摊开], whereas an omelet is folded over in half onto the additions.[煎蛋卷是对半折，里面加料]is very common.with frittata,there's no crust,so it's little healthier than a quiche.
