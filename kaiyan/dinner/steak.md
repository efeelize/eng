# I.Popular steak and wine pairings
> Everyone knows steak and wine go together, but what cut goes best with which wine? You can never go wrong with Cabernet Sauvignon [赤霞珠], especially when paired with a fattier cut [油脂重的部位] like the ribeye /rɪb aɪ/ [肋眼肉], T-bone, or porterhouse [上等腰肉]. Zinfandel /'zinfəndel/ [n.馨芳葡萄酒], Syrah are also high in tannin and flavor. The extra fat makes stronger wines taste smoother and less bitter, while the wine enhances the flavor of the steak.

> However, as we learned from the lesson dialogue, some prefer a lighter pairing with their steak. To complement a leaner cut, such as the filet mignon /ˌfiːleɪ ˈmiːnjɒ̃/ [菲力牛排], Merlot /mεə'ləu/ [梅洛] or Pinot noir /pino nwaʁ/[黑皮诺]are good choices. You could even go with a more acidic white wine.

> Another thing to keep in mind is how you prefer your steak cooked. The more well done your steak, the less fat there will be, as it will be cooked away. Since heavier reds pair better with fattier cuts, they also complement rarer steaks, whereas lighter reds and stronger whites will pair better with more well-done steaks.

# II.The Steakhouse
> If you're looking for the best cuts of beef steak, other meats or even seafood, your best bet will always be the steakhouse (or steak house). Following hundreds of years of tradition, steakhouses are experts in all things steak. In North America, while there are many large chains, there are also many famous independent steakhouses, such as Bobcat Bite in Santa Fe [圣塔菲], Carmen's in Toronto[多伦多], and Bern's Steak House in Tampa [坦帕], just to name a few. New York City itself has nearly a dozen independent steakhouses! No matter whether the steakhouse is large or small, independent or part of a large network, one thing is for sure: they are not cheap, but their food is delicious!

# III.grammar
# 1.steakhouse /ˈsteɪkˌhaʊs/ 牛排馆 & server & caterer/catering company  [n.餐饮服务者]
> 1)You might be used to this person being called a waiter.female, waitress. But nowadays and the United States we often say "server". And this word goes for both male and female.Men and women can both be called servers.

> 2)So a caterer /'ketərɚ/ could be a company or it could be one person, we don't know, and it doesn't really matter. The point is that they cater; they provide the food.And sometimes the drinks. so if you see waiters or servers at an event, they're probably part of a catering company.

# 2.rare [一分熟] & medium rare [三分熟] & medium [五分熟] medium well [七分熟] & well down [全熟] & & beef  /kɑrˈpɑtʃo/ [n,生牛肉片]
> 1)rare is cooked the least,it's very read or pink in the center.you will have a little bit of blood still in the meat.

> 2)medium rare:it would be more cooked. So there's still gonna be some red pink meat in the middle, and definitely a lot of blood. But much more cooked while great there.

> 3)A medium steak is still going to be slightly pink in the middle. And shouldn't have really any blood.a lot of our Chinese listeners, usually will order using a number scale. Medium would probably be like a 5,it's got maybe just a tiny bit of pink,but it's mostly cooked all the way through.this is the safe choice if you don't want your steak to be too pink, to be too bloody, that you also don't want it to be very well down, and dry. Then you can choose the medium steak.

> 4)don't go to a steakhouse and order a well done steak.You just insult the waiter.well done means it's very well cooked, it's cooked a long time.so if you cut your steak, a well down steak is not pink or red, in the middle.It should be all brown looking, and maybe even the outside might look a little bit blackened charring /tʃɑr/ [n.炭化].it'll be tough as leather.

> 5)beef carpaccio /kɑrˈpɑtʃo/：It's very thinly-sliced [adj.薄切片的] beef, but it's raw.Yeah, so it's not thick[adj.厚的]. But carpaccio /kɑrˈpɑtʃo/ here,it's Italian and because of that.

# 3.that's plenty & more than enough [phr.足够了]
> it means enough,but we would never say that's enough,sounds kind of angry,usually thay's what parents will say when their kids start fighting,that's enough,stop.

# IV.type
# 1.cut /kʌt/ 牛的部位
## 1)filet mignon /fɪˈleɪ ˈmɪgnən/  & filet dé mignon [菲力牛排] & tenderloin /ˈtɛndərˌlɔɪn/ [腰部嫩肉]
> filet mignon is just a type of steak, so its meat comes from tenderloin of the cow,after the ribs,it's further towards the back,it's not the butt,it's in between the butt and the ribs,it's the most tender cut and very lean. 

## 2)rib eye /rɪb aɪ/ [肋眼牛排] 
>  if you guys know anatomy /ə'nætəmi/ [n.解剖,解剖学] a little bit, you could tell that this is from the rib section of the cow. It's, it's not a rib, it's a steak from that area of the cow.it's a larger piece of meat.it's a lot bigger than a filet mignon, there is actually a piece of bone in the middle of the steak, the small circle, then it looks like an eye, and that's the rib,and it also has pieces of fat,so it's got around the edges,and maybe pieces of fat that you would cut off.

## 3)T-bone /ˈtiˌboʊn/ [T骨牛排]
> So this T-bone is comprised of 2 different cuts. One would be the tenderloin, and then the other is the strip.it's a big steak with like a kind of T-shaped bone in it.

## 4)Wagyu beef [和牛]
> it is any of several breeds of cattle /'kæt(ə)l/ [牛], the most desired of which is genetically predisposed /ˌpri:di'spəuzd/ [先倾向于…的] to intense marbling and to producing a high percentage of oleaginous /ˌəʊlɪ'ædʒɪnəs/ unsaturated /ʌn'sætʃə'retɪd/ fat [不饱和脂肪]. The meat from such wagyu cattle is known for its quality, and commands a high price.

## 5)strip /strɪp/ [长牛排] & New York strips [纽约牛排]

## 6)marbled /ˈmɑrbəld/ & snowflakes /ˈsnofleks/ [雪花]
> 1)marbled, this means kind of fatty. And the fat is kind of, well, it's kind of mixed in with the meat on this part of the steak. Some steaks, you have like, the fat on the side and then the steak is lean. But this, the fat is kind of within the meat itself.

> 2)in english,we use marbled,not snowflakes.because it looks kind of some like the marble.

# 2.flavor
## 1)tender /ˈtɛndər/ [嫩的] juicy /ˈʤusi/ [多汁的] & tender [嫩] & tough [老]
> So you could say a tender steak, it's soft, chew very easily. A tough steak is very difficult to chew, and it's kind of dry and hard.

## 2)fatty /ˈfæti/ [肥] & lean /lin/ [瘦]
> 1)lean is low in fat,maybe even no fat. If there's no fat on something, it's very lean.

> 2)This word lean, we can also use to describe a person, someone who is not very fat.so maybe someone who works out a lot, kind of skinny. But has some muscle too, him or her. we could say that they're lean,their body is low in fat.

## 3)prime /praɪm/ [优质的、高级的]
> it basically means well quality,good steak.it's usually kind of expensive.

# V.pattern
***Good evening, welcome to the Riverside Steakhouse. Is this your first time here?***

***Yes, it is. We heard it’s the best place for steak in town. We are looking forward to a great meal!***

***Well, I can guarantee you will. Here are the menus. Do you know what kind of cut you'd like?***

***I prefer something tender and juicy, but not fatty.The filet mignon would be perfect for you. It’s the most tender cut and very lean.***

***Um, I’m still deciding between the rib eye and the T-bone.***

***They’re both prime cuts. The rib eye is highly marbled. And it’s the fat that gives it a lot of flavor.The T-bone is a two-for-one cut. It's comprised of a piece of tenderloin, which is very tender and a piece of strip, which has a good chew. It’s separated by a T-shaped bone. So it gives you two kinds of cuts in one piece of steak.***

***You’ve made some excellent steak choices. What kind of sides would you like?***

***I’ll get the arugula /əˈruɡələ/ [芝麻菜] salad. What about you honey?***

***Well, the roasted asparagus  /əˈspɛrəgəs/ [芦笋] looks tempting.***

***Ah, I’m terribly sorry. We’re all out of asparagus tonight. Could I interest you in our sautéed Brussels sprouts /ˈbrʌsəlz spraʊts/ [孢子甘蓝] instead?***

***I’m not really a fan of Brussels sprouts. I’ll just go with the baked potato. Could you recommend a wine for us?***

***Well, since you ordered the filet mignon and the T-bone, I’d recommend a full-bodied /fʊl-ˈbɑdid/ [饱满的] Cabernet Sauvignon /ˌkæbərˈneɪ ˌsɔˈvɪnjɑn/ [加本力苏維翁].***

***Cab is a little too strong for me. Is there something a little more mellow that would still pair well with both of our steaks?***

***In that case, might I recommend this Merlot /ˈmɜrlət/ [梅洛]? It’s a 2012. Very mellow but still sophisticated.***

***Excellent. We’ll take that then. And for dessert we’ll split a soufflé. We’ve heard it’s to die for!***
