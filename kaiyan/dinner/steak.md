***Good evening, welcome to the Riverside Steakhouse. Is this your first time here?***

***Yes, it is. We heard it’s the best place for steak in town. We are looking forward to a great meal!***

***Well, I can guarantee you will. Here are the menus. Do you know what kind of cut you'd like?***

***I prefer something tender and juicy, but not fatty.The filet mignon would be perfect for you. It’s the most tender cut and very lean.***

***Um, I’m still deciding between the rib eye and the T-bone.***

***They’re both prime cuts. The rib eye is highly marbled. And it’s the fat that gives it a lot of flavor.The T-bone is a two-for-one cut. It's comprised of a piece of tenderloin, which is very tender and a piece of strip, which has a good chew. It’s separated by a T-shaped bone. So it gives you two kinds of cuts in one piece of steak.***

***You’ve made some excellent steak choices. What kind of sides would you like?***

***I’ll get the arugula /əˈruɡələ/ [芝麻菜] salad. What about you honey?***

***Well, the roasted asparagus  /əˈspɛrəgəs/ [芦笋] looks tempting.***

***Ah, I’m terribly sorry. We’re all out of asparagus tonight. Could I interest you in our sautéed Brussels sprouts /ˈbrʌsəlz spraʊts/ [孢子甘蓝] instead?***

***I’m not really a fan of Brussels sprouts. I’ll just go with the baked potato. Could you recommend a wine for us?***

***Well, since you ordered the filet mignon and the T-bone, I’d recommend a full-bodied /fʊl-ˈbɑdid/ [饱满的] Cabernet Sauvignon /ˌkæbərˈneɪ ˌsɔˈvɪnjɑn/ [加本力苏維翁].***

***Cab is a little too strong for me. Is there something a little more mellow that would still pair well with both of our steaks?***

***In that case, might I recommend this Merlot /ˈmɜrlət/ [梅洛]? It’s a 2012. Very mellow but still sophisticated.***

***Excellent. We’ll take that then. And for dessert we’ll split a soufflé. We’ve heard it’s to die for!***
