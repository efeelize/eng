# I.Popular steak and wine pairings
> Everyone knows steak and wine go together, but what cut goes best with which wine? You can never go wrong with Cabernet Sauvignon [赤霞珠], especially when paired with a fattier cut [油脂重的部位] like the ribeye /rɪb aɪ/ [肋眼肉], T-bone, or porterhouse [上等腰肉]. Zinfandel /'zinfəndel/ [n.馨芳葡萄酒], Syrah are also high in tannin and flavor. The extra fat makes stronger wines taste smoother and less bitter, while the wine enhances the flavor of the steak.

> However, as we learned from the lesson dialogue, some prefer a lighter pairing with their steak. To complement a leaner cut, such as the filet mignon /ˌfiːleɪ ˈmiːnjɒ̃/ [菲力牛排], Merlot /mεə'ləu/ [梅洛] or Pinot noir /pino nwaʁ/[黑皮诺]are good choices. You could even go with a more acidic white wine.

> Another thing to keep in mind is how you prefer your steak cooked. The more well done your steak, the less fat there will be, as it will be cooked away. Since heavier reds pair better with fattier cuts, they also complement rarer steaks, whereas lighter reds and stronger whites will pair better with more well-done steaks.

***Good evening, welcome to the Riverside Steakhouse. Is this your first time here?***

***Yes, it is. We heard it’s the best place for steak in town. We are looking forward to a great meal!***

***Well, I can guarantee you will. Here are the menus. Do you know what kind of cut you'd like?***

***I prefer something tender and juicy, but not fatty.The filet mignon would be perfect for you. It’s the most tender cut and very lean.***

***Um, I’m still deciding between the rib eye and the T-bone.***

***They’re both prime cuts. The rib eye is highly marbled. And it’s the fat that gives it a lot of flavor.The T-bone is a two-for-one cut. It's comprised of a piece of tenderloin, which is very tender and a piece of strip, which has a good chew. It’s separated by a T-shaped bone. So it gives you two kinds of cuts in one piece of steak.***

***You’ve made some excellent steak choices. What kind of sides would you like?***

***I’ll get the arugula /əˈruɡələ/ [芝麻菜] salad. What about you honey?***

***Well, the roasted asparagus  /əˈspɛrəgəs/ [芦笋] looks tempting.***

***Ah, I’m terribly sorry. We’re all out of asparagus tonight. Could I interest you in our sautéed Brussels sprouts /ˈbrʌsəlz spraʊts/ [孢子甘蓝] instead?***

***I’m not really a fan of Brussels sprouts. I’ll just go with the baked potato. Could you recommend a wine for us?***

***Well, since you ordered the filet mignon and the T-bone, I’d recommend a full-bodied /fʊl-ˈbɑdid/ [饱满的] Cabernet Sauvignon /ˌkæbərˈneɪ ˌsɔˈvɪnjɑn/ [加本力苏維翁].***

***Cab is a little too strong for me. Is there something a little more mellow that would still pair well with both of our steaks?***

***In that case, might I recommend this Merlot /ˈmɜrlət/ [梅洛]? It’s a 2012. Very mellow but still sophisticated.***

***Excellent. We’ll take that then. And for dessert we’ll split a soufflé. We’ve heard it’s to die for!***
