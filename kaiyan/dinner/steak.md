# I.Popular steak and wine pairings
> Everyone knows steak and wine go together, but what cut goes best with which wine? You can never go wrong with Cabernet Sauvignon [赤霞珠], especially when paired with a fattier cut [油脂重的部位] like the ribeye /rɪb aɪ/ [肋眼肉], T-bone, or porterhouse [上等腰肉]. Zinfandel /'zinfəndel/ [n.馨芳葡萄酒], Syrah are also high in tannin and flavor. The extra fat makes stronger wines taste smoother and less bitter, while the wine enhances the flavor of the steak.

> However, as we learned from the lesson dialogue, some prefer a lighter pairing with their steak. To complement a leaner cut, such as the filet mignon /ˌfiːleɪ ˈmiːnjɒ̃/ [菲力牛排], Merlot /mεə'ləu/ [梅洛] or Pinot noir /pino nwaʁ/[黑皮诺]are good choices. You could even go with a more acidic white wine.

> Another thing to keep in mind is how you prefer your steak cooked. The more well done your steak, the less fat there will be, as it will be cooked away. Since heavier reds pair better with fattier cuts, they also complement rarer steaks, whereas lighter reds and stronger whites will pair better with more well-done steaks.

# II.grammar
# 1.steakhouse /ˈsteɪkˌhaʊs/ 牛排馆 & server & caterer/catering company  [n.餐饮服务者]
> 1)You might be used to this person being called a waiter.female, waitress. But nowadays and the United States we often say "server". And this word goes for both male and female.Men and women can both be called servers.

> 2)So a caterer /'ketərɚ/ could be a company or it could be one person, we don't know, and it doesn't really matter. The point is that they cater; they provide the food.And sometimes the drinks. so if you see waiters or servers at an event, they're probably part of a catering company.

# 2.well down [全熟] & rare [一分熟] & medium rare [三分熟] & medium [五分熟]
> 1)so well done is a way of cooking meat, and we'll talk about some of the different ways of cooking meat, well done means it's very well cooked, it's cooked a long time.so if you cut your steak, a well down steak is not pink or red, in the middle.It should be all brown looking, and maybe even the outside might look a little bit blackened charring.so usually a well done steak is a little bit dry, in my experience.

> 2)rare is cooked the least,it's very read or pink in the center.you will have a little bit of blood still in the meat.

> 3)medium is might be 50% cooked,it's got maybe just a tiny bit of pink,but it's mostly cooked all the way through.this is the safe choice if you don't want your steak to be too pink, to be too bloody, that you also don't want it to be very well down, and dry. Then you can choose the medium steak.

# 6.beef carpaccio [n,生牛肉片] & medium rare [adj.三分熟] & well done [adj.全熟] & tender [adj.嫩的]
> 1)It's very thinly-sliced [adj.薄切片的] beef, but it's raw.Yeah, so it's not thick[adj.厚的]. But carpaccio here is not French. It's a different language.It's Italian and because of that.

> 2）It's still red on the inside, hopefully not bleeding. And the next one is medium rare which is what the customer says here.

> 3)so well done means that it's cooked really well. You know, there's no red left.

> 4)melt in your mouth, yeah. Essentially if it's tender, it's not chewy. 

# 3.tender [嫩] & tough [老]
> So you could say a tender steak, it's soft, chew very easily. A tough steak is very difficult to chew, and it's kind of dry and hard.

# IV.pattern
***Good evening, welcome to the Riverside Steakhouse. Is this your first time here?***

***Yes, it is. We heard it’s the best place for steak in town. We are looking forward to a great meal!***

***Well, I can guarantee you will. Here are the menus. Do you know what kind of cut you'd like?***

***I prefer something tender and juicy, but not fatty.The filet mignon would be perfect for you. It’s the most tender cut and very lean.***

***Um, I’m still deciding between the rib eye and the T-bone.***

***They’re both prime cuts. The rib eye is highly marbled. And it’s the fat that gives it a lot of flavor.The T-bone is a two-for-one cut. It's comprised of a piece of tenderloin, which is very tender and a piece of strip, which has a good chew. It’s separated by a T-shaped bone. So it gives you two kinds of cuts in one piece of steak.***

***You’ve made some excellent steak choices. What kind of sides would you like?***

***I’ll get the arugula /əˈruɡələ/ [芝麻菜] salad. What about you honey?***

***Well, the roasted asparagus  /əˈspɛrəgəs/ [芦笋] looks tempting.***

***Ah, I’m terribly sorry. We’re all out of asparagus tonight. Could I interest you in our sautéed Brussels sprouts /ˈbrʌsəlz spraʊts/ [孢子甘蓝] instead?***

***I’m not really a fan of Brussels sprouts. I’ll just go with the baked potato. Could you recommend a wine for us?***

***Well, since you ordered the filet mignon and the T-bone, I’d recommend a full-bodied /fʊl-ˈbɑdid/ [饱满的] Cabernet Sauvignon /ˌkæbərˈneɪ ˌsɔˈvɪnjɑn/ [加本力苏維翁].***

***Cab is a little too strong for me. Is there something a little more mellow that would still pair well with both of our steaks?***

***In that case, might I recommend this Merlot /ˈmɜrlət/ [梅洛]? It’s a 2012. Very mellow but still sophisticated.***

***Excellent. We’ll take that then. And for dessert we’ll split a soufflé. We’ve heard it’s to die for!***
