***Hi there, what can I get for you?***

***Um, this is my first time trying gelato. What's good?***

***Well, if you want something more Italian, Tiramisu, salted caramel, pistachio and Neapolitan are our best sellers. If you like more traditional flavors, try cookies and cream, mint chocolate chip and cookie dough. And if you are in the mood for something lighter, the sorbets are excellent!***

***Can I mix flavors?***

***You sure can. We can do up to 3 scoops of different flavors.***

***Hmm. In that case, I’ll have a scoop of salted caramel, a scoop of cookies and cream and a scoop of pistachio***

***Great choices! Now, would you like that in a cup or waffle cone?***

***Cone please.***

***Would you like any toppings?***

***No, it's fine. Oh, I didn't realize you have popsicles too.***

***They are so good! Make sure you try them next time!***

***I like strawberry and sometimes cookies and cream.***

***Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?***

***I really don't like plain vanilla ice cream***

***What about frozen yogurt? This week, they are buy one get one free.***

***Yogurt sounds really disgusting! I would rather try low fat ice cream.***

***Look over there, they have a pint of it on sale. Do you think we should get some?***

***Not today. I think we should stick with our regular choices.***
