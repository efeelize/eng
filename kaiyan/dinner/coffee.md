***Hi there. What can I get for you?***

***I’d like a grande iced americano, please.***

***Have you tried our new cold brew coffee?***

***Oh. Is that different than an iced americano?***

***Yes, a little. It’s coffee that is brewed in cold water instead of hot water.***

***Does it taste different?***

***It has a richer taste. Many people prefer it.***

***Ok, I’ll try it, but with half ice, please.***

***Actually, there’s no ice in cold brew. Would you like it sweetened?***

***Yes, but just half-sweet, please.***

***No problem. We also have non-fat and soy milk by the pick-up counter.***
