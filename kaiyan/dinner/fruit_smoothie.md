# Fruit & Smoothies
# I.Fruit consumption in the U.S.
> The announcement that two Brazilian companies bought Chiquita Brands International, known for its bananas, in a deal worth $1.3 billion, certainly demonstrated one thing: there’s big money in fruit. And it’s only getting bigger.

> In 2004, fruit was the fifth most popular food item consumed by Americans, according to Harry Balzer, a chief industry analyst who studies food trends for NPD Group. Today, the category is now in second place [水果目前已位列第二], taking over the spot once occupied by soft drinks [取代了曾排在第二名的软饮料]. (Sandwiches have long been in first place.)

> Americans’ growing health consciousness [健康意识] is partly responsible for fruit’s ascent. There is also the convenience factor [便捷性也是要考虑的因素]. “It requires no cooking. It can be part of breakfast, lunch, or dinner,” Balzer says.

> Grocery stores are devoting more space to produce. Sherry Frey, senior vice president of Nielsen Perishables Group, says: “When you look at the entire store, one of the best growing departments is produce."

> 1)cranberry sauce :It's a sauce made of cranberries.so cranberries are like these little round red berries. Anyway, this is a very standard Thanksgiving dish, a sauce made of cranberries, it's pretty sweet and it goes great with the turkey.the turkey it's bigger than a chicken, usually, the meat also is a bit more dry, than the chicken.There's less fat in a turkey, so you have to cook it, a bit more carefully I think. Otherwise, it gets very dry. remember many Thanksgiving where I was thinking God, I need more gravy /'ɡrevi/ [n.肉汁] on this turkey because it's too dry,maybe more cranberry /'kræn'bɛri/ sauce [n.蔓越莓酱].

> 2)So currant is kind of like a little cherry.it's smaller than a blueberry,it's common in wines,Carbnet /'kæbərnei/ and Cab Sauv /kæb Sauv/ [n.赤霞珠,红酒].

> 2) so nutrition is more like the study of how to eat.More like the idea.

- I should go and talk to my nutritionist before I start a new diet.

# 2.boosts /busts/ 增强剂 
> 1)Protein is the stuff that builds your muscle.And especially if you don't like to eat bread, you need to eat protein. So, now, usually when we think of protein, we think of meat.like chicken has lots of protein, beef has lots of protein.

> 2)a boost is an extra, or an add-on, and it just means even more of something.and you can get something, it's called like an energy boost, like for example, if I'm feeling kind of sleepy after lunch, I need a boost or extra energy, sometimes people drink coffee.

# 3.carbohydrate /ˌkɑːrboʊˈhaɪdreɪt/ [碳水化合物] & low-carb /loʊ-kɑːrb/ [低碳水的]

# 4.high-protein /ˈproʊtiːn/ [高蛋白质的]  & whey /weɪ/ protein powder [乳清蛋白粉] & protein powder [蛋白粉]
> 1)protein.It's a type of food, or should I say a lot of foods have protein. You can think about this as being in egg whites,Meat has a lot of protein. But there's also certain types of vegetables that have protein. If you wanna get big muscles, you need to eat a lot of protein.So it's the same idea we say high-protein. This counts as an adjective or we can just say, I like to eat protein, where it is a noun.So a lot of these diets, these new diet fads, they have these rules, low-carb, high-protein.

> 2)whey is dairy based,it means it's made from milk, but if you're allergic to milk, you need to find a different one.Or if you don't want to put chocolate in your breakfast. So, you can actually get chocolate flavored protein powder,now this protein is whey.

***This is so neat, Grace. I’ve never used an app to buy fruit before. So what should we get?***

***Start with the easy stuff. Add a few apples and bananas to the cart.***

***Okay. How about one of these grapefruits?***

***Those aren’t grapefruits, Liam. They are pomelos. They’re a bit less bitter.***

***Well I’m down to try one. Hey it looks like they have both tangerines and clementines. Which would you prefer?***

***These clementines are seedless so let’s get those. I don’t want to have to spit out or choke on any seeds.***

***Done. Oooh these berries look good too. We could put them in our smoothies!***

***Let’s pass on them this time. They’re way too expensive. Besides, our freezer is so full of that frozen strawberry and blueberry blend you bought at the supermarket.***

***No problem. Hey wait a second, why do they have tomatoes in a fruit store?***

***Well first of all, the tomato is technically a fruit. Second of all, those aren’t tomatoes, those are persimmons.***

***I had no idea that there were so many fruits I didn’t know.***

***Well that’s why you have me. It’s like they say, two heads are better than one!***

# VI.pattern

***Sure. No problem.***

# VI.patten
***What kind of juice do you want?***

***Yeah I guess so. Anyway, I’m going to try it. Are you sure you’re sticking to the same old thing?***

***Maybe I should try something new too. Pineapple and papaya looks nice.***
