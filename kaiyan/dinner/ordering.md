# Ordering_food

# I.grammar
# 1.server 
> You might be used to this person being called a waiter.Yeah, female, waitress. But nowadays and the United States we often say "server". And this word goes for both male and female.Men and women can both be called servers.

# 2.Can I start you two off with some water?
> Can I start you two off with some water? Alright? So it's a lot of easy words but it might be a little bit confusing.this just means "Can I bring you some water first?"Right. Do you want water? If you want water, I'm going to bring that to you first.

# 3.appetizers /'æpə'taɪzɚ/ [n.前菜] & side dish [配菜] & entrees /'ɔntrei/ [n.主菜]
> 1）So of course, an appetizer is a small dish that you eat first, you know, so that you have an appetite /'æpɪtaɪt/ [n.胃口].Normally, something we start off with, this is what comes before the main meal.

> 2)We have lots of different side dishes you can choose from.So a side dish is not part of any of the main things on the menu. It's something that you can add to other food, right?Exactly, like mashed potatoes.Yeah, that's one kind of side dish or you know, French fries or green beans. Those are not side dishes for a pizzeria. But those are some typical American side dishes and almost every restaurant has side salad, right?It is. It's so easy and so quick. 

> 3)Yes, it's the biggest part of the meal. So notice this word "entree" is spelled "E-N-T-R-E-E". But it's French, so we don't say "en-tree", we say "on-tray"

# 4.house wines [n.餐厅特色葡萄酒] & merlot /mεə'ləu/ [n.梅尔洛] & grab your wine 
> 1）Yeah, well, first of all the word "house" here is an adjective which is definitely not what we're used to.Yeah, refers to the restaurant.Right, so it's the restaurants. Emm, it's not their special wine. It's more like their basic wine.Right. If you don't want to think about what wine to order, then this wine is pretty good and it's not expensive. It's the house wine.

> 2)So merlot is a kind of wine and it pairs with something.

> 3)Yeah. This is a, a very informal kind of slang way to just say "go get".Right, bring your wine, get your wine, grab your wine.

# 5.pairs [v.搭配] & complements 
> 1)This a very common word used with wine in general. It just means that they go together well. You have two things: the food and the wine, and they go well together.

> 2)another way to say that is "complements". Right, the wine complements this type of food. They go together well.

# 6.side salad [佐餐的沙拉] &  & salad dressing [n.沙拉酱] & on the side [phr.酱料分开放]
> 1)side salad. So we know what a salad is. A side salad is more like a smaller salad and it's like a side dish. Side salad actually normally comes out before your meal. They don't have to, but don't be surprised if it does.

> 1) Now a salad usually has salad dressing, right?Em, sauce?Right. Sometimes they can put it directly on a salad for you. So usually they put it on a little cup and I'll give it to you, so you can put it on yourself. You can make sure they don't put on too much.

> 3)But if you don't want that, then you can say--Yeah. I'll have the salad dressing on the side.Yes. And you can do this with anything that has a sauce on it even if you order a sandwich with mayonnaise or a cheeseburger with ketchup, you can ask for any of that, on the side.

# 7.look over & look at 
> look over :It's more like read casually or skim through, we say.Yeah, you are not gonna to read every word on the menu, right? Just could kind of look at this, look at that pretty quickly. That's called "looking over something".

# 8.torn /tɔrn/ [adj.纠结]
>  If you torn between two things, you can't decide between two things. It sounds very dramatic, though.Yeah. It's really not. It just means you are indecisive and unsure.And "torn", it sounds like painful, like, "Ooh, I really can't decide, I'm so torn!"Well. When you think about it, one side of you wants this, one side of you wants that, you don't know what to do.

# 9.by far
> So if you say something is the most, you know, you can use "by far" to tell us that, you know, number two is way behind.So, for example, you could say, "That is by far the funniest TV show ".She is by far the prettiest girl in the class. Sometimes we also put "by far" after.Yeah, it's less common that way, but you can say that, too.Yeah, like I can say, "You are the tallest one by far. Right?"

# 10.spaghetti /spə'ɡɛti/ & lasagna /lə'sænjə/ [n.千层面]
> Mhmm. Like he goes with the seafood spaghetti and she chose the vegetarian lasagna.

# II.情态动词
> Modals for suggestion may include can, could, may, might, must, will, would, and should.A few rule of using modals: 

- Modals are helping verbs [情态动词有助动词的作用]

- Used with the base form of the verb, modals create verbal phrases. [动词使用其原形，情态动词组成动词短语]

- Modals do not change form. [情态动词形态固定]

- Modals never end in “s”, even in 3rd person singular.[情态动词即使在"三单一"的情况下结尾也不加“s”]

- Use “not” to make modal verbs negative. [用“not”表示情态动词否定式]

- Don’t use double modals. [不要同时使用两个情态动词]

- Modals lack past tense forms, except ‘could’ and ‘would’ which serve as the past of ‘can’ and ‘will’.[情态动词没有过去式，除了‘could’和‘would’分别是‘can’和‘will’的过去式。]

- You could try the banana pancakes.

- He should not wear those pants with that shirt.

- They might want to get to the cinema early.

# III.pattern
***Good evening and welcome to Mario’s Pizzeria. My name is James and I’ll be your server tonight. Can I start you two off with some water?***

***That would be great, thank you. We’re looking at your appetizers here… do you have anything vegetarian? /'vɛdʒə'tɛrɪən/ [n.素的]***

***We sure do. We have the fried eggplant[煎茄子] or you could try our garlic cheese bread[蒜蓉芝士面包]; it’s one of our specialties /ˈspɛʃəlti/ .***

***Ok, we’ll take the cheese bread as an appetizer please.***

***May I suggest a glass of one of our house wines this evening as well? Our merlot pairs very well with the garlic cheese bread.***

***Yeah, I’ll take a glass of merlot.***

***I’d prefer a glass of chardonnay /ˌʃɑ:dən'ei/ [n.夏敦埃酒] please. And I’d like a side salad to start with as well. Italian dressing on the side.[前菜要一小份色拉，要意大利色拉酱，酱单独放在旁别]***

***Of course. I’ll grab your wine while you look over the rest of the menu.***

***Here is your wine. Have you two decided on your main entrees or do you have any other questions about the menu?***

***Well… I’m torn between the seafood spaghetti[海鲜意面] and the cheese tortellini /ˌtɔrtlˈini/ [芝士云吞]. What do you recommend?***

***Our seafood spaghetti is by far our most popular dish. We have fresh seafood flown /flon/ [fly的过去式] in daily[我们每天都会进新鲜的海鲜]. However, our cheese tortellini is excellent as well; it’s just very filling[这个很容易饱]. They are both great, but I would suggest the spaghetti between the two.***

***Sounds good, I’ll have that then. And she would like the vegetarian lasagna /lə'sænjə/. And that'll be it for now.***

***I’ll get your order in right away. Let me know if you need anything else in the meantime.***
