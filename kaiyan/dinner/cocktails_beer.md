# I.Where in the United States you can't purchase alcohol
> There are 10 states in the U.S. that allow dry[adj.禁酒的] counties /'kaʊnti/ [n. 郡, 县], according to the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association[美国国家酒精饮料控制协会]. An additional 15 states are “partially dry,” having some alcohol controls[部分禁酒].

> In the following image, blue counties are wet[不禁酒], red counties are dry, and yellow counties are either partially dry, with some alcohol restrictions, or have municipalities /mjʊ'nɪsə'pæləti/ [n.自治市;自治区] within them that are dry.

> Some states began allowing counties and cities to ban alcohol sales following the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, while in others, like Alaska and Mississippi, municipalities didn’t start going dry until the 1960s and 1980s[20世纪60年代和80年代], respectively[分别]. But the trend in many of these dry areas is toward loosening restrictions, the National AlcoholBeverage Control Association says.

> “While there may always be dry localities in the United States, they are getting fewer and far between[但数量却越来越稀少],” according to a March report from thegroup.

> In Maryland, for example, the last dry town, Damascus /də'mæskəs/ [大马士革], became wet in 2012, and Kansas /ˈkænzəz/[n.堪萨斯州] has seen more than a dozen counties go wet in the past decade. Advocates in Arkansas /ˈɑ:kənsɔ:/ /ˈɑrkənˌsɔ/ [阿肯色州] hope their state will join that list.

# II.grammar
# 1.booze [n & v.酒] &  boozy & tanked & get shitface [adj. 喝醉的]
> 1)booze:it just means alcohol.very colloquial /kə'lokwɪəl/ [adj.口语], very spoken term here for the word alcohol. we don't really say alcohol,cause alcohol is like the chemical name.and actually it can be a verb too. If you're going to go get drunk, if you're going to go drink a lot, you could say:" Oh, you know, we're going to go boozing.  if you think about it, if you're going to go to the store with your friends, you're probably not going to say:"Hey, let's go buy some alcohol." It's the most kind of formal.alcohol is actually too formal, so we just say booze or we just say wine or beer or liquor.

> 2)boozy:we even can change it to an adjective when we say boozy, that means I was kind of drunk, I was a bit boozy last night.

# 2.pack a punch[phr.后劲大] & crowd-pleasers & do the trick [phr.奏效]
> 1）So a crowd is like a bunch of people and if they're pleased, they're happy, they're satisfied, so these two wines, you can't really go wrong with them, they're kind of like the standard typical wine that most people enjoy.and it's not really about how fancy or good they are, just everybody always likes them. so they are crowd pleasers.

> 2)do the trick, this is a really awesome expression. It just means they will do the job well.

> 3)so and it doesn't just have to be alcohol and getting drunk or something like that. For example, if you're sick, you know a doctor might give you some medicine and say here, take this medicine, it will do the trick.

# 3.light [度数低，口味淡] & strong [度数高] & heavy [口味浓] & peaty taste
> 1)we can use this word "light" to talk about how much alcohol is in the drink, but also to talk about the flavor.we always use this word "light" when we're talking about drinks with less alcohol, like "light beer."

> 2)But if we're talking about the opposite,so we want something that's not light, we can either use "strong" if we want something with a lot of alcohol.

> 3)but if we're talking about taste, we prefer to use the word "heavy."

> 4)For whiskey, it has a peaty taste because it's processed in peat /pit/ [n.煤炭], which is like a ground. So it absorbs the flavour in the smell of the thing that the container that it's sitting in.

# 4.higher / lower proof [n.稍高/低度数] & high/low/less calories & NA/non-alcoholic [无酒精的]
> 1)proof: it's a word that we use to talk about how much alcohol is in, the beer or the wine or the liquor that you're drinking.like if were drinking something strong, something that really packs a punch like vodka, the proof is I think 80?

> 2)it's just kind of a system for measuring the alcohol and it doesn't use percent, so we just say higher proof, lower proof and like this other phrase, less calories.

# 5.lightweight [酒量差] & alcohol tolerance [正常酒量] & big drinker [n.爱喝酒的人] & hold my liquor/heavy drinker [酒量好] & alcoholic
> If your drinking is a problem, you are an alcoholic.so we don't want to be called an alcoholic but a big drinker is okay.

# 6.stock up on sth [phr.囤货] / in stock
> 1）stock up:Yeah, this is used all the time. When you buy things for the future, like especially food or drinks.Right, you buy a lot because you need to be prepared.

> 2)in stock:But to stock it also means to kind of like have, so if you go to a store, you might ask the people at the store if they have something in stock.

# 7.cocktail & mixed drinks & bartender & Mixology [鸡尾酒调酒] & mixologist [调酒师] & pretentious [做作]
> When we're talking about making cocktails, we usually say "Can you mix me a cocktail?" or "Can you make me a cocktail?"

# 8.dive bar [便宜酒吧] & hole in the wall [便宜的小地方] & bang for your buck [性价比高]

# 7.BYOB [bring your own beer] / BYOM [bring your own meat]
> Yeah, so the BYO obviously this means bring your own, do we have other ones that don't end with B?

> Well, when I was invited to a barbecue or barbecue to a lot of meats, like sausage or hamburgers, on the invitation it said BYOM.Meat, yes yes yes, so you can change it to anything, bring your own girlfriend.

# III.Cocktails
# 1.classic cocktails
## 1)Bloody Mary
> 1）This is one of the most common cocktails that you'll find especially on a brunch mean,it's a brunch staple. Like the Old Fashioned, the variation of this drink may vary significantly on where you order one. And Bloody Mary is simply a drink with Vodka, tomato juice and pepper tabasco /təˈbæsko/ sauce [n.辣酱油] , celery /'sɛləri/ [n.芹菜]. It's very good. Some people think of it as a meal in a glass.A Bloody Mary is usually just ordered during the day. So if you at a bar at night, do not trouble your bartender by asking for a Bloody Mary at night.

> 2)That's because there are quite a few ingredients that go into the Bloody Mary. For starters, you need vodka, but it's the Bloody Mary mix that really brings the drink full circle. When I was a bartender, my mix contained tomato juice, black pepper, horseradish /'hɔrs'rædɪʃ/ [n.山葵], celery salt, Worcestershire /'wustəʃiə/ sauce, crab seasoning and Tabasco sauce.When topped off with vegetable garnishes /'gɑrnɪʃ/ [vt.装饰] like olives, pickled carrots, or both, you come to realize that the Bloody Mary isn't just a cocktail: it's a meal in a glass.

## 2)Mimonsa /mɪ'mozə/ [n.含羞草鸡尾酒]
> This is probably the most popular brunch drink that you'll find on a menu.Mimosa. It's champagne and orange juice.

## 3)Hot Toddy [热棕榈酒]
> This is a hot drink that makes you feel better when you have a cold. Everyone has a different recipe, but it's basically hot water, sugar, lemon, cinnamon, and most importantly, whiskey!

## 4)apple cider /'saɪdɚ/ [苹果酒]
> Apple cider is a great way to keep warm. Plus it's made from apples so there is no need to add extra sugar.

## 5)sangria /sɑːnˈɡriː.ə/ [桑格利亚酒，葡萄酒里泡水果] & pitchers /ˈpɪʧərz/ [扎]
> 1)sangria is mixed with different alcohol and different juices, so like maybe orange juice, lemon juice, some brandy and of course white or red wine.So it has this really nice sort of a spicy zesty flavour to it, just to note though the classic one is the red sangria, so with red wine.

> 2)so a pitcher is kind of a large jug,a jug container, it's usually like six glasses. I mean you could also get the sangria in a glass but I think it more commonly comes in a pitcher.

## 6)Gimlet [吉姆雷特]
> Typically made with gin /dʒɪn/ [n.杜松子酒] (unless substituted with vodka) and lime /laɪm/ [青柠] juice and served in a martini glass, this cocktail offers a tart yet refreshing experience.

## 7）Screwdriver
> A super easy drink to make, the Screwdriver is just vodka and orange juice served over ice in a tall glass. This drink is a common brunch selection.

## 8) Gin and Tonic / G&T's [金汤力]
> as many people like to refer to them, like the Screwdriver, this drink is super simple and any bartender will know how to make it. It's just gin and tonic water [奎宁水] served over ice with a slice of lime or lemon.

## 9）the Daiquiri [代基里]

## 10）Mojito. /məˈhiːt̬oʊ/ [莫吉托]
> it is /məˈhiːt̬oʊ/. It is not /məˈdʒiːt̬oʊ/ or /ˈmoʊdʒiːtoʊ/. this awesome Cuban concoction is made with rum, mint leaves, sugar and crushed ice. Indeed, Mojitos are great on a hot summer's day.

## 11）Old Fashioned [古典鸡尾酒]
> Made with either bourbon /'bɝbən/ [波本酒] or rye whiskey [黑麦威士忌], simple syrup /'sɪrəp/ [糖浆] and bitters, this typically sweet and savory cocktail has many variations. So just go to a few different bars and order an Old Fashioned to find out for yourself.

## 12）Margarita [玛格丽塔]
> This delicious Mexican treat is made with tequila, triple sec (a sweet liquor used in many different cocktails), lime juice, lots of ice, and usually comes in a salted rim glass. If you're not a big fan of salt like myself, any bartender will be happy to make this drink without the salted rim. Just remember to say, "hold the salt!".

## 13)Manhattan [曼哈顿] & manhattan up [去冰] & Manhattan on the rocks [加冰]
> Named after the New York City borough, the Manhattan is a sweet and savory whiskey-based cocktail that is made with either bourbon or rye whiskey mixed with sweet vermouth /vɚ'muθ/ [n.苦艾酒] by being shaken or stirred and then served in a martini glass with a cherry garnish. A true classic.

## 14)Martini 
> 1)martinis are a very famous cocktail because they are the cocktail that James Bond, 007, drinks."Barkeeper, make me a martini, please.Shaken, not stirred."

> 2)Originally, Martinis were gin-based. However, the vodka-based Martini has long since become a popular choice as well. Whether you're going with gin or vodka, the martini is a strong, dry cocktail that is sure to pack a wallop.

> 3)To make a Martini, the gin or vodka is mixed with dry vermouth (and olive juice, if you like it dirty) by either stirring or shaking it with ice and served either up or on the rocks with an olive or lemon twist garnish.As soon as you take a sip, you'll realize that the Martini gets right to the point as there is no masking of flavors -- it's truly a boozy experience not for the faint of heart.

## 17）Fuzzy navel [迷雾之晨，桃子烈酒+橙汁]

# IV.hard stuff  & liquor [烈酒]
# 1.tequila /tə'kilə/ [n.龙舌兰] 
> tequila, that's really from one place,just comes from good old Mexico. 

# 2.vodka  /'vɑdkə/ 
>  I think most people know that that is like the drink in Russia and places like Poland and probably the Ukraine? I guess it probably originated or first came from Russia, but now I mean you have popular vodkas that come from France and even America actually, there's vodka from all over, either way these three types of hard liquors will do the trick.

# 5.bourbon /'bɝbən/ [波本酒]

# 6.Rum [朗姆酒] & dark/light rum [黑/淡朗姆酒]

# 7.shots/shooters [n.小杯烈酒] & single/double shot 
> 1)so a shot is just straight alcohol.it's in a small glass and you drink it very quickly.if you are in a hurry, you don't want to wait for the bartender to mix your drink, you can just order shots.And sometimes people call them shooters,it's designed to just be drunk in one drink. We don't sip a shot.

> 2)this question often comes up in coffee shops as well. So if you order a latte, for example, they might ask you, "Do you want a single shot or a double shot latte?"Now also keep in mind, guys, they might not say the word "shot." They might say single or double. You need to guess that they mean "shot."

# V.Beers
# 1.brands

## 6)Hoegaarden [福佳白啤酒]
> Hoegaarden is another beer from Belgium, but it is what is known as a "wheat beer." If you ask a Belgian person, they will tell you to pronounce it "WHO-garden," but most Americans will say "HO-garden." Don't worry too much about having two A's in the name: it just sounds like the English word "garden." 

## 7)Tsingtao [青岛啤酒]
> Did you think we would really talk about the top beer brands without talking about Qingdao? I always love to tell my Chinese friends that it's available everywhere in Canada. But because of the old spelling, no one knows how to pronounce it!

## 8)IPA /aɪ-pi-eɪ/ [印度淡啤酒] & hoppy [adj.啤酒花足的]
> hoppy this is a very important beer description word ah all you need to know really is it means that the taste is a little bit bitter. It's a kind of a sour taste.

# 2.type
## 1)draught /dræft/ & draft beer & what's/what do you have on tap [生啤、桶装啤酒]

> 2)"on tap", at a bar or at a restaurant, especially with beer, ah the "tap" is literally that metal piece that comes out of the top of the table, and that's where they pour the beer from.Now beer on tap usually means it's not bottle or canned beer. It's fresher, They have a big container of the beer underneath the bar, and so that's what comes out of the taps is fresher. Many people think it's better tasting.

## 2）Ale /eɪl/ 麦芽酒

## 3）craft beer [n.手工精酿啤酒] & brewery/microbrewey [啤酒酿造厂] & Small-batch /bæʧ/ [小批量的]

> 2)Small-batch:So very similar to the idea of microbreweries, it just means it's made in small amounts.

## 4）light beer [n.低度啤酒] & dark beer [浓啤酒]
> I mean some ladies like IPA's or beers really pack a punch, but I mean generally maybe it's safe to say that a lot of ladies like light beer, which just means it's easy to drink.
