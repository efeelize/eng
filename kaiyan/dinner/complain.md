# Complaining at the restaurant
# I.The right way to complain at a restaurant
> In a perfect world, every restaurant reservation [预留] would be seated exactly on time and every steak would arrive precisely cooked to temperature[烹饪得恰到好处]. But when you dine out[出去吃饭], often and inevitably you’ll find cause for complaint. Here's how to complain at a restaurant:

# 1. Know when to speak up
> Though it's not always possible, the best time to complain is as soon as possible, while you’re still at the restaurant and while the offending dish [不满意的菜品] is still in front of you. Additionally, you should evaluate [衡量] whether your problem is truly worthy[值得] of complaining about.

# 2.Be polite
> If the need to complain arises, flag down [拦下了] your server or a manager and calmly explain the issue. A good place to start is: “Excuse me, but my...is overcooked [糊了] / too salty / inedibly spicy.[辣到不能吃]”

# 3.Be specific about a resolution, if you have one in mind
> If you have a specific idea about what would resolve the situation to your liking (within reason!), feel free to say it. The manager may not necessarily be able to give you exactly what you want[尽管经理或许不能完全按你说的做], but if it’s within their power[只要不超出他们的能力范围], they probably will. It’s in their best interest that you leave satisfied.

# II.grammar
# 1.should & if 
> In today’s lesson, the restaurant manager tells his unhappy customers that he will give them a coupon to use, “should” they decide to come back.

> “Should” here is not related to “must”, as in “you should go”. Rather, it is much more related to “if”. He could have said “if you decide to come back”, but “should” sounds much more polite and formal.[这儿的“Should”并不太像“must”的意思，和“you should go”（你应该去）中的用法不一样。而更像“if”的意 思。餐厅经理本可以说“if you decide to come back”（如果您决定还回来的话），但是“should”听起来会更加礼 貌正式。]

> This is a great word to use when you are talking to your clients or customers, or other times when you need to be a bit more formal.[当你在和客户或者顾客交流时，或者是你在稍显正式的场合，“should”是一个很好用的词。]

- 1. I'll leave the book on the table, should you change your mind about reading it.

- 2. Should you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

- 3. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to send out the invitations to the party!

# 2.pay as you go [n.现收现付]
- A system in which a person or organization pays for the cost of something when they occur rather than before or afterwards is called pay as you go.

# 3.where do I begin [phr.从何开始] & to make matters worse [phr.更糟糕的是]
> 1）this is what you say when you have a long list of complaints.If you say something negative.

> 2)It's used to explain how the situation got even worse.Yeah, so I'm complaining about one thing and then this thing is even worse than the first part.

# 4.took forever [phr.特别慢] & take no time 
> 1)So take forever here just try not to think about "take" in the literal sense, like take the phone or take some money. It's just a word we use when we're talking about time.Exactly but when you say "You took forever" obviously it doesn't mean forever. It just means a really, really, really long time, slower than you expected.

> 2)it is the opposite of "take forever" if something happens very quickly.I would probably say it took no time.

# 5.short-staffed [adj.人手短缺的] & under-staffed & swamped [adj.忙的不可开交]
> 1)so like maybe someone calls in sick or some accident happened and you did not have enough people.Alright so this doesn't only happen at a restaurant it can happen anywhere and usually in service jobs.

> 2)you can also say under-staffed and it pretty much has the same meaning as short-staffed.

> 3)So we can always use this phrase at work. I'm swamped at work, I'm swamped with work… They're not exactly the same but pretty similar.Anything. Yeah you don't need to have a job in order to be swamped you could be swamped with homework, swamped with chores at home. So it just means really, really, really busy.

# 6.attitude adjustment & fix your attitude 
> 1)So adjustment, of course, is similar to change but adjust is more slight?Yeah. Like you adjust the temperature. I mean it's basically a fancy word for change or fix and we're gonna put a few more examples into our expansion section. so go ahead and check that out.

> 2)So if a person is like that someone might say that my attitude is not so good and I have a bad attitude. So it's kind of the way that you think and this affects the way that you behave as well and we often talk about bad attitudes when we talk about teenagers.

# 7.meeting expectations [phr.达到期望]
> 1)so expectation that's something that you think should happen.And if something is not meeting expectations then it's not reaching that level.So we would see this phrase a lot when we were in school like when the teacher would give us a report card, it might say, "Lisa is doing great but Adam is only meeting expectations."It's not bad, but it's just not what the teacher wants. The teacher wants to see you, emm...you get better scores or you to do better in class.

> 2)Well it sounds like there are other things that are not meeting the customer's expectations because he says, "I specifically asked for no mayonnaise /'meənez/ [n.蛋黄酱,可简写：mayo] on my burger."

# 8.I specifically said & I specifically asked &  I specifically stated. 
> All of these sort of verbs that have to do with talking or asking or commanding.Yeah. And it usually means that you did this for a reason.Yeah. I wasn't just being crazy when I was speaking. I wanted no mayonnaise on my hamburger that is why I specifically said, "Please, no mayonnaise."

# 9.pride ourselves on sth  [phr.我们引以为傲的]
> "So "pride" obviously is the noun version of proud.And when you are proud you are very pleased with something that you have done.

> Companies and managers will always say, "Alright, we pride ourselves on something.Yeah so even pride ourselves on service that's a very common one. We pride ourselves on our tradition or history. It really can be anything.

# 10.hygienic /ˌhaɪdʒɪ'ɛnɪk/ [adj.卫生的] & sanitary /'sænə'tɛri/ [adj.清洁的]
> 1) tending to promote or preserve health.like:hygienic habits like using disposable tissues;hygienic surroundings with plenty of fresh air.hygienic is usually related to the body.So for example, in this case, we used hygientic because there is a hair in the soup.The kitchen was hygienic but you know sometimes hairs did start swimming in soups or other dishes. That something that happened from time to time[phr.偶尔].

> 2) I think about sanitary as referring to waste.The garbage or anything like that.free from filth /fɪlθ/ [n.污秽] and pathogens /'pæθədʒəns/ [n.病原体、物].

# 11.on the house [phr.免单]
> Because it means that the restaurant is paying.Yes. So anything that is free at a restaurant or a bar is on the house.

# III.pattern
***Where do I begin? First of all, our food took forever!***

***Oh I'm terribly sorry to hear that. I'm afraid we're a bit short-staffed today.***

***Well, that's no excuse for the server's rude behavior. She needs an attitude adjustment!***

***Okay, I'll be sure to let her know. Is there anything else that is not meeting expectations?***

***My deepest apologies, sir. They are really swamped in the kitchen tonight and must have forgotten.***

***Well, to make matters worse, look what we found swimming in my wife's soup! A hair!***

***Oh dear. Sir, we pride ourselves on keeping a clean and hygienic kitchen, but of course these things happen from time to time.***

***Well, they shouldn't! I'm afraid that in the future we might have to take our business elsewhere!***

***I completely understand. As an apology, tonight's meal is on the house.And we can give you a 20% off coupon for next time, should you decide to come back.***
