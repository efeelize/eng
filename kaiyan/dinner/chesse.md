# I.Cheese platters or boards
> America is known for many things, but it’s not really known for its high quality cheese. Of course, America does have its own cheese: it’s just a little different than what you will find in Europe. In the 1950s, Kraft Foods [卡夫食品公司] created a process to make a new kind of cheese that you can buy in a jar. Cheese Whiz [罐装涂抹奶酪] has been found in American refrigerators ever since.

> 2)After World War II, American GIs returned home with a taste for a delicious new food they had  discovered in  Italy – pizza. Today, thanks in large part to these soldiers, mozzarella rates second only  to cheddar in  popularity in the United States. The process to make mozzarella puts the curds /kə:d/ [n.凝乳] in hot water and then stretched [拉伸的] and kneaded /ni:d/ [揉捏] into parallel strands. This allows mozzarella to melt and flow and gives it its characteristic stretch. Whole milk mozzarella is richer in taste and has excellent melting properties.

Because the development of blue mold [青霉]occurred randomly [偶然], blue cheeses were highly prized. Today, cheesemakers [奶酪产商] add mold cultures to develop blue veins in the cheese, which has a full, earthy flavor [泥土气息] that varies among styles, and a firm, crumbly texture.

# 5.Cheddar [切达] & aged cheddar /ˈʧɛdər/ 陈年切达干酪

The rind is inedible with a distinctive, traditional herringbone /'hɛrɪŋbon/ pattern pressed on it [有传统鲱鱼图案].

About 50 years ago, the only way to protect Swiss wheels as they ripened was to allow a hard rind to form [在成熟期间保护瑞士干酪的唯一方法就是形成一个坚硬表皮]. The advent of plastic packaging, which keeps moisture in but allows carbon  dioxide to escape, made it possible to produce rindless /'raɪndlɪs/ [adj. 无外皮的] Swiss cheese in blocks. Rindless blocks were developed for better yield in foodservice; retailers appreciate the higher yield and ease of cutting.

***Actually, I’m not much of a cheese eater. The only cheeses I eat are Mozzarella on pizza, and Parmesan as a pasta topping.***

***Don’t worry sir. Gouda isn’t too strong like Blue Cheese, or too mild like Cheddar. It’s a great middle of the road cheese.***

***I’m not a big fan of blue cheese. It’s smelly.***

***What about the brie and manchego?***

***Not the brie - it’s the same creamy texture as the camembert.***

***Oh and we have some aged cheddar. I like the sharpness.***

***Ok. Are these slices thin enough?***

***They’re fine. And just cut a wedge of camembert.***

***I’ll also put out a mix of crackers that will pair well with all of the cheeses.***
