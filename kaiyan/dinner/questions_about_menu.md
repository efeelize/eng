# Questions_about_menu
# I.Why do restaurants serve tasting menus?
# 1.Showing off a chef's skills [厨师炫技]
> Tasting menus are often seen as the domain of wealthy patrons /'peitrən/ [有钱顾客] who can spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on three-hour meals decided exclusively by the kitchen.

> For chefs, tasting menus [品鉴菜单] can be an opportunity to get creative with the different dishes and show off their skills.

# 2.Our taste buds [味蕾] prefer small plates
> Ideally, tasting menus would be perfectly suited for the human palate /'pælət/ [味觉].That's because humans often suffer from "palate fatigue /fə'tig/ " after three or four bites[吃三到四口之后经常会出现“味觉疲劳”], says food historian [食品历史学家] Beth Forrest.Essentially[本质上], our taste buds get bored. "But not if you stop right at the moment where people are in full enjoyment. Their memory of the food is going to be much more pleasurable," she says.[但是如果你在完全享受的状态刚好停下来，就不会出现这种情况。味蕾对食物的记忆就会更加愉快]

# 3.The history of the Western tasting menu
> While the current wave of tasting menus probably dates back to [追溯到] the 1960s, Western multi-course menus [西方多种类菜单] can be traced back to the 19th century and even earlier, says Forrest.

> "You can go back even further to medieval /ˌmidɪ'ivəl/ times [中世纪] with three large courses[三大道菜肴], but upwards /'ʌpwədz/  of 25 dishes per course[每一道的菜品在25盘以上]," she says. "The drama that you see is because you had so many plates on the table at once."[戏剧性的场面就是你可以看到桌上一下子摆满很多菜]

# II.grammar
# 1.复合形容词
> When an adverb /'ædvɝb/  or adjective /'ædʒɪktɪv/ is used with a past participle (e.g., thinly-sliced), it is called a “compound adjective.” When compound adjectives come before the noun they modify, we use a hyphen /'haɪfn/ [n.连字符] in between (e.g., pan-seared tuna). However, there is no hyphen when they are after the noun and after the BE verb (e.g., the tuna is pan seared). 

> 一个副词或形容词和一个过去分词一起使用，称之为“复合形容词”。如果复合形容词在所修饰词的前面，我们就会在 形容词和分词之间加一个连字符（例：pan-seared tuna）。不过，当复合形容词在所修饰词和be动词的后面时，就不 用加连字符（例：the tuna is pan seared）

- 1. He's an old-fashioned person and is not very open minded.

- 2. Even though our neighborhood is not densely populated, there are many brightly-lit streets.

- 3. She's a very well-behaved dog, but some people are still scared of her because she's big.

# 2.tasting menu [n.品鉴菜单]  &  a la carte /ˏɑː lɑː ˈkɑːt/ [n.单点菜单] & courses [n.菜肴] &  & signature [adj.招牌菜] & special & look over & look at
> 1)so tasting menu is a little bit of each kind of food, so that everybody can try it.so it could be like as one meal. It could be like a bunch of different foods on a platter /'plætɚ/ [n.浅盘子] .

> 2)a la carte, yes. Interesting you will see this, this is an important phrase to learn. But commonly we don't usually say it at a, at a regular restaurant. Usually fancy restaurants say a la carte.So, a la carte though, just means that separately. But the question here is, if both customers need to get the tasting menu or if, you know one of them can just get things a la carte. 

> 3)courses here are basically different dishes.

> 4)It's the dish that the restaurant is known for.just like a person signature is unique, the restaurant's signature dish is unique. They're famous for that dish. And in this case, it's tiramisu. That must mean it's really good.

> 5)a special is just a meal that they kind of change once in a while. So, you might go in on a certain day and the special will change right? It usually has a discount too.

> 6)look over :It's more like read casually or skim through, we say.Yeah, you are not gonna to read every word on the menu, right? Just could kind of look at this, look at that pretty quickly. That's called "looking over something".

# 3.appetizers /'æpə'taɪzɚ/ [n.前菜] & appies & starters & share plates & side dish [配菜] & entrees /'ɔntrei/ [n.主菜] & the mains & for starters [phr.开始]
> 1）So of course, an appetizer is a small dish that you eat first, you know, so that you have an appetite /'æpɪtaɪt/ [n.胃口].Normally, something we start off with, this is what comes before the main meal.so let's say like if you're in a casual restaurant, and appetizer might be, you know like French fries or nachos /ˈnɑˌtʃo/ [n.墨西哥玉米片]. But if you're in a fancier restaurant, you'll probably have something like a cheese platter.

> 2)and sometimes we might say "appies" because we're too lazy to say appetizers.Or, maybe even more commonly, you will hear 'starters.'Yeah, or, 'share plates.'

> 3)We have lots of different side dishes you can choose from.So a side dish is not part of any of the main things on the menu. It's something that you can add to other food, right?Exactly, like mashed potatoes.Yeah, that's one kind of side dish or you know, French fries or green beans. Those are not side dishes for a pizzeria. But those are some typical American side dishes and almost every restaurant has side salad, right?It is. It's so easy and so quick. 

> 4)It's actually called main sometimes too,it's the biggest part of the meal. So notice this word "entree" is spelled "E-N-T-R-E-E". But it's French, so we don't say "en-tree", we say "on-tray"

> 5)So actually, first of all, let's talk about 'the main.' So 'the mains' just means 'the main meal.'

> 6)So "for starters" is a phrase that we use that means to begin with, first off. So there's a list of things that Jim is going to tell her that she needs to change and the first thing is that she has way too much text in these slides.

# 4.go with [phr.选择] & torn /tɔrn/ [adj.纠结] & Can I start you two off with some water? & server & caterer/catering company  [n.餐饮服务者]
> 1)And often has this feeling or sense that you were waiting or hesitating. Or you couldn't decide and finally you choose. That's when we say go with.and you can use it, you know, anywhere. You don't need to use it just for food. For example, if I am shopping for clothes. The lady at the front can ask me "Oh, what did you choose", right? And then I can say "I went with the T-shirt".

> 2) If you torn between two things, you can't decide between two things. It sounds very dramatic, though.Yeah. It's really not. It just means you are indecisive and unsure.And "torn", it sounds like painful, like, "Ooh, I really can't decide, I'm so torn!"Well. When you think about it, one side of you wants this, one side of you wants that, you don't know what to do.

> 3)Can I start you two off with some water? Alright? So it's a lot of easy words but it might be a little bit confusing.this just means "Can I bring you some water first?"Right. Do you want water? If you want water, I'm going to bring that to you first.

> 4)You might be used to this person being called a waiter.Yeah, female, waitress. But nowadays and the United States we often say "server". And this word goes for both male and female.Men and women can both be called servers.

> 5)So a caterer /'ketərɚ/ could be a company or it could be one person, we don't know, and it doesn't really matter. The point is that they cater; they provide the food.And sometimes the drinks. so if you see waiters or servers at an event, they're probably part of a catering company.

# 5.sashimi  /sɑ'shimi/ [n.生鱼片] & pan seared [adj.香煎的] & greasy [adj.油腻的] & oily /'ɔɪli/ 
> 1)so pan seared, it means that you cooked the edges at a really high heat.Yes. So, it's in a pan and the searing part. Like you said, it's at high heat. So, it makes the outside cooked, but the inside is not cooked.And we see this often with like beef and tuna.

> 2)Now greasy is usually used when we talked about frying things.So, for example, chips are greasy. French fries are greasy. And you know, like really heavy meat with a lot of fat can be greasy as well.greasy is usually for frying things, French fries like that. 

> 3)But oily has the sort of more healthy sense to it. Like if a pasta is oily or a salad is oily. Oil is good for you right? Olive oil.don't say greasy skin. You can say oily skin. But greasy skin is like an insult. Get your greasy hands off me.

# 6.beef carpaccio [n,生牛肉片] & medium rare [adj.三分熟] & well done [adj.全熟] & tender [adj.嫩的]
> 1)It's very thinly-sliced [adj.薄切片的] beef, but it's raw.Yeah, so it's not thick[adj.厚的]. But carpaccio here is not French. It's a different language.It's Italian and because of that.

> 2）It's still red on the inside, hopefully not bleeding. And the next one is medium rare which is what the customer says here.

> 3)so well done means that it's cooked really well. You know, there's no red left.

> 4)melt in your mouth, yeah. Essentially if it's tender, it's not chewy. Your knife cuts it easily and your teeth chew it easily.Yeah, so tender meat is always a good thing.

# 7.side salad [佐餐的沙拉] &  & salad dressing [n.沙拉酱] & on the side [phr.酱料分开放]
> 1)side salad. So we know what a salad is. A side salad is more like a smaller salad and it's like a side dish. Side salad actually normally comes out before your meal. They don't have to, but don't be surprised if it does.

> 1) Now a salad usually has salad dressing, right?Em, sauce?Right. Sometimes they can put it directly on a salad for you. So usually they put it on a little cup and I'll give it to you, so you can put it on yourself. You can make sure they don't put on too much.

> 3)But if you don't want that, then you can say--Yeah. I'll have the salad dressing on the side.Yes. And you can do this with anything that has a sauce on it even if you order a sandwich with mayonnaise or a cheeseburger with ketchup, you can ask for any of that, on the side.

# 8.情态动词
> Modals for suggestion may include can, could, may, might, must, will, would, and should.A few rule of using modals: 

- Modals are helping verbs [情态动词有助动词的作用]

- Used with the base form of the verb, modals create verbal phrases. [动词使用其原形，情态动词组成动词短语]

- Modals do not change form. [情态动词形态固定]

- Modals never end in “s”, even in 3rd person singular.[情态动词即使在"三单一"的情况下结尾也不加“s”]

- Use “not” to make modal verbs negative. [用“not”表示情态动词否定式]

- Don’t use double modals. [不要同时使用两个情态动词]

- Modals lack past tense forms, except ‘could’ and ‘would’ which serve as the past of ‘can’ and ‘will’.[情态动词没有过去式，除了‘could’和‘would’分别是‘can’和‘will’的过去式。]

- You could try the banana pancakes.

- He should not wear those pants with that shirt.

- They might want to get to the cinema early.

***In that case, may I suggest the fish? It's pan-seared and served with fresh seasonal vegetables.***

***Would you like to add the wine pairing?***

# V.pattern
***Good evening and welcome to Mario’s Pizzeria. My name is James and I’ll be your server tonight. Can I start you two off with some water?***

***That would be great, thank you. We’re looking at your appetizers here… do you have anything vegetarian? /'vɛdʒə'tɛrɪən/ [n.素的]***

***We sure do. We have the fried eggplant[煎茄子] or you could try our garlic cheese bread[蒜蓉芝士面包]; it’s one of our specialties /ˈspɛʃəlti/ .***
