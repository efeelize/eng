# Questions_about_menu

# I.Why do restaurants serve tasting menus?

# 1.Showing off a chef's skills [厨师炫技]
> Tasting menus are often seen as the domain of wealthy patrons /'peitrən/ [有钱顾客] who can spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on three-hour meals decided exclusively by the kitchen.

> For chefs, tasting menus [品鉴菜单] can be an opportunity to get creative with the different dishes and show off their skills.

# 2.Our taste buds [味蕾] prefer small plates
> Ideally, tasting menus would be perfectly suited for the human palate /'pælət/ [味觉].That's because humans often suffer from "palate fatigue /fə'tig/ " after three or four bites[吃三到四口之后经常会出现“味觉疲劳”], says food historian [食品历史学家] Beth Forrest.Essentially[本质上], our taste buds get bored. "But not if you stop right at the moment where people are in full enjoyment. Their memory of the food is going to be much more pleasurable," she says.[但是如果你在完全享受的状态刚好停下来，就不会出现这种情况。味蕾对食物的记忆就会更加愉快]

# 3.The history of the Western tasting menu
> While the current wave of tasting menus probably dates back to [追溯到] the 1960s, Western multi-course menus [西方多种类菜单] can be traced back to the 19th century and even earlier, says Forrest.

> "You can go back even further to medieval /ˌmidɪ'ivəl/ times [中世纪] with three large courses[三大道菜肴], but upwards /'ʌpwədz/  of 25 dishes per course[每一道的菜品在25盘以上]," she says. "The drama that you see is because you had so many plates on the table at once."[戏剧性的场面就是你可以看到桌上一下子摆满很多菜]

# II.grammar
# 1.复合形容词
> When an adverb /'ædvɝb/  or adjective /'ædʒɪktɪv/ is used with a past participle (e.g., thinly-sliced), it is called a “compound adjective.” When compound adjectives come before the noun they modify, we use a hyphen /'haɪfn/ [n.连字符] in between (e.g., pan-seared tuna). However, there is no hyphen when they are after the noun and after the BE verb (e.g., the tuna is pan seared). 

> 一个副词或形容词和一个过去分词一起使用，称之为“复合形容词”。如果复合形容词在所修饰词的前面，我们就会在 形容词和分词之间加一个连字符（例：pan-seared tuna）。不过，当复合形容词在所修饰词和be动词的后面时，就不 用加连字符（例：the tuna is pan seared）

- 1. He's an old-fashioned person and is not very open minded.

- 2. Even though our neighborhood is not densely populated, there are many brightly-lit streets.

- 3. She's a very well-behaved dog, but some people are still scared of her because she's big.
