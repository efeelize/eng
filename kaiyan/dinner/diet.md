# I.Tips for a healthier lifestyle
> Setting out to make [着手养成] healthy lifestyle changes can feel simultaneously inspiring and intimidating. Here are some little things you can do that will make a big difference in the long run.

# 1.Drink a glass of water before each meal.
> Drinking the amount of water you need each day is necessary for all of your body's systems to function smoothly, and it will also keep you from overeating [暴饮暴食] due to hunger.

# 2.For every hour you spend sitting, get up and walk for five minutes.
> Sitting all day isn't good for your butt or your heart. Physical activity is extremely important for your longevity.

# 3.Every time you make a new goal, break it up into chunks.
> This can apply to anything and everything health-wise. Let's say you've been having a huge sandwich for lunch every day but want to cut back on refined carbs [精制碳水化合物]. Eat whole-wheat bread [全麦面包] some days of the week until you get used to it, then phase out [习惯它] the refined sort [淘汰精制面包].

# II.grammar
# 1.(that)All they (to) do/know/get is…
> So we basically have as a subject here a string of words, a little phrase, all that something...That's our subject "all that they do." That's the subject. if that sounds a little confusing, we can give a lot more examples to help make it a bit clearer. One thing I always like to say is, all I know is he's my friend.And if we could even say another phrase, "all you get is" with these diets. All you get is a bunch of yo-yos.

> The "all they do" is a noun phrase that has a relative clause "that they do," but the "that" is removed. All together, "all they do" means "the only thing that they do." Because it acts as a noun, it can be followed by a verb ("is").

> Usually we could use an infinitive after the verb "is" as the complement of the sentence. But in this expression, we can omit "to" and say "all they do is" + do something. This is common in informal English.

> In the noun phrase "all they do," "do" can be replaced by other verbs. But if the verb is "want," we normally say "all they want is to make ..." instead of saying "all they want is make…" because we always say "want to" + do something.

- 1. All he does is study. He should take a break.

- 2. I don't care about the size of my apartment. All I want is to have a good view from it.

- 3. I don't know who broke the window. All I know is that it wasn't me.

# 2.in doing so/in so doing & in verb-ing
> The phrase "in doing so" means "because of that" and is often used when there is an unintended or unexpected result.This phrase is especially common if the result is negative or the opposite of what was intended.it's really the result of doing something else. and it's usually unexpected or you did not intend it. However, it can be positive as well.

> 2)In + VERBing;let's take the sentence I just said. We can say, "I tried to fix my computer, and in doing so I broke it." We can also say, "In trying to fix my computer, I broke it." so again, we're pointing to the result of fixing the computer, and it's this unexpected result that you really weren't hoping for.

- 1. I tried to fix my computer, and in doing so, I broke it. -> In trying to fix my computer, I broke it.

- 2. My friend thought she was making the best decision for us, but in doing so, showed her lack of judgment.

- 3. Jason tried to explain the task to his new co-worker, but in doing so, only made it more confusing.

- 3. The company started to provide free training seminars for employees, and in so doing, productivity increased.

# 3.cleanses /ˈklenzɪz/ [v.清洗,净化]
> 1)so cleanse. When I was growing up, "cleanse" was a verb, it is something that you do. If you eat a lot of vegetables, for example, that will help you cleanse your system.

> 2)and cleanse we also use it if you get a cut and you're bleeding, you need to cleanse that wound before you put a Band-Aid on it.another way we might use it is in a more spiritual sense, cleanse your soul.Like I went into the mountains and then came back and I felt like I cleansed my soul.

> 3)but at some point in the past couple of years, it became a noun.

- 1. Make sure you cleanse your cut before you put on a bandage.

- 2. I was on a cleanse last week but I don't really feel different. 

- 3. Going for a walk in the forest was cleansing for my soul.

# 4.in one go 一口气、一次性 & cutting down on [减少] 

# 5.is not rocket science [ ...并不难] & It's not brain surgery [形容事情简单，不难做] & yo-yos /ˈjoʊjoʊz/ [摇摆不定、时常反复的事物]
> 1)So when we use this phrase "is not rocket science," it just means it's not hard. So you can use this for anything. Staying healthy is not rocket science. Making money is not rocket science. Having good relationships is not rocket science. There is one other phrase that is very similar. And it's similar because of the same idea. Brain surgery. It's very complicated. So you could say, it's not brain surgery.

> 2)that's another really good phrase and we use these two phrases a lot when other people think it's hard and we're telling them "No, it's not hard."Like playing music. This is not brain surgery. It's not rocket science. I could even say it's not rocket surgery.

> 3) yo-yo, Of course, it's a game that you play with a toy on a string. And it's also a name.we can even say they yo-yo back and forth.

# 6.for granted 
> this phrase "take something for granted." You don't know what you have until you don't have it anymore. you're not grateful for it. And this could be for health. We also use it a lot in a relationship.Sure you can take your partner for granted or take your wife or husband for granted.so really it's kind of the opposite of being grateful for something.

# 7.credit & take all the credit
> So credit is like getting a compliment for doing something good.This isn't "credit" that you would see in the credit card. Although it's somewhat related. This is more like praise.And as a result, he will get credit.

> but sometimes I might get too much credit for doing something. I don't want to take all the credit.

# 8.cutting down on [phr.减少]
> So we have this really useful phrase here "cut down on" and it's just whenever we do less of something that's not a good habit.we don't often say like I should cut down on exercise.So we always want to cut down on negative things. Yeah, you cut down on smoking, cut down on junk food or cut down on doing something.like cut down on watching TV.

# 9.lasting [adj.持久的，恒久的] & long-lasting 
> 1)You might even see the phrase long-lasting, which you don't really even need to say long-lasting. Because if something lasts, it lasts.Maybe you could emphasize it with long, "long-lasting." Lasting friendships, long-lasting friendships.Or something that somebody said to me the other day, "it left a lasting impression."

> 2) lasting impression. Yeah, for sure, China left a long-lasting impression in my soul.

# III.diet fads /ˈdaɪət fædz/ [减肥饮食法]
# 1.a well-balanced diet & a balanced + n.

> 2)a balanced anything just means that there is not too much of A and too little of B. we often use this when talking about our work-life balance. 

# 2.keto diet /ˈkeɪtoʊ ˈdaɪət/ 生酮饮食
> this diet is so popular because you can eat a lot of high-fat foods, like bacon and sausage.and butter. They put butter into coffee. And this is kind of the problem with a lot of these diets as they let you eat a lot of one thing. you can eat all of the sausages that you want. It's okay.It works by lowering levels of insulin and shifting your primary fuel source from sugar to ketones. These compounds are made from fatty acids, and your brain and other organs can burn them for energy.

> Ketogenic diets don't gradually increase their carbs. Instead, they keep carb intake very low to ensure followers stay in ketosis.
