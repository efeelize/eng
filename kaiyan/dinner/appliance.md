***Our first barbeque of the season! This is going to be great!***

***I know, I can’t wait either! What kind of meat do you want to serve?***

***Everything! Burgers, chicken wings, drumsticks, sausages, ribs and kebabs.***

***Well we can get the burgers, wings and drumsticks here at the supermarket, but maybe we should buy the sausages, ribs and kebabs from the butcher. The quality is better there.***

***Ok sure. Do you want to get some seafood?***

***I told Jane to bring some shrimp, so we don’t need to worry about that. Do you need anything else?***

***Yeah I need the ingredients for my secret marinade.***

# V.pattern
***Alright, this is my first time to a housewares store in a while.***

***Well, you need your morning pick-me-up, so let’s start with a coffee maker.***

***Sounds good. And I was thinking about picking up a blender to make smoothies.***

***Oh, are you going on a diet? It’s about time!***

***Hey, be nice. I’ve been eating a lot less bread.***

***So, then I guess we can throw out our old toaster?***

***That’s what I thought. So, how about getting some new cutlery?***

***Good idea. And that reminds me, we don’t have any measuring spoons.***

***Oh, right. We should pick up a cutting board and knife set, too.***

***Sounds good. Let’s head over to the kitchen utensils section.***
