# I.The biggest smart home trends
# 1.Increasing standardization
> There's the annoyance /ə'nɔɪəns/ of needing to use a whole load of different apps to set up and control all of the different devices from different manufacturers in your smart home. So it's encouraging to see plans from Apple, Google, and Amazon to team up to create a set of standards [创建一套标准] designed to make smart homes simpler and, importantly, more secure. 

>Smart homes actually become smart, thanks to machine learning.Home appliances don't automatically become "smart" just because they are plugged into [接入] the internet - a better term for much of the technology we've seen so far is "connected home.[互联家居]"

> That's set to change over the next decade, as more and more devices begin to make use of machine learning, computer vision [计算机视觉], natural language processing [自然语言处理], and other technologies that actually are capable of thinking, making decisions, and learning.

# 2.In-home healthcare [家庭医疗] gets smarter
> In-home smart healthcare offers the potential to reduce some of the stress put on traditional healthcare channels – doctors and hospitals.

> Some of this will be achieved by preventative measures [预防性措施] – such as wearables [可穿戴设备] that help us to lead a healthier lifestyle by monitoring our activity levels, quality of sleep, and nutrition. Other devices will offer interventionist services [干预服务], for example, allowing us to remotely connect with medical practitioners, alert carers when an elderly person falls in their home, or even diagnose illnesses using AI.

# II.grammar
# 1.fresh from the + n. & fresh from the oven/sea/farm
> 1)So "fresh from the oven" means it just came out of the oven, and it's probably still quite hot.

> 2)if you're talking about seafood or fish, you might say it's fresh from the sea.

> 3)Or if you're talking about eggs, you can say they're fresh from the farm.

# 2.that reminds me/speaking of that
>  "that reminds me", this is a great expression. It's a chunk. It means that makes me think of something else.There is a similar expression which is "speaking of that". So it just has the same meaning there.

Like a pasta /'pɑstə/ [n.意大利面食] maybe something like that.

> 2)there's so many different types of casseroles and usually they're kind of crispy on the top.On the inside, usually it's like soft, if there's meat in there, it's very very tender and very juicy.and sometimes it might be creamy /'krimi/ [adj.乳脂状的] also, just depends on the type of casserole you are eating.

> 1)there's a kind of soup called stew. And that has lots of pieces lots of meat lots of vegetables and not much broth not much water just a lot of pieces. It's just like a thick /θɪk/ [adj.浓稠的] soup.

> 2)some of my students will say they like to have soup but what they mean is like the water part like not the noodles not the meat not the vegetables the water and that's called the broth.so as you can see broth and soup are pretty similar but broth just tends to mean the water part and a lot of Chinese soups are mainly just broth, so for example you have chicken soups or any kind of like ginger soup.
