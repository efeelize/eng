# I.Storm in a teacup: British and Chinese tea cultures
> As tea was first introduced to Britain by the royal family, British tea culture is marked with a sense of formality and grace, and traces of this can still be found in modern tearooms[即便在现代茶室中，仍然可以寻找到这种文化痕迹]. In the past, people dressed up [郑重打扮起来]and attended tea parties where socializing was the main activity, with concerts, garden walks [花园散步] and gambling as entertainment.

> As tea and sweet treats[n.甜点] go hand in hand, the English ritual /'rɪtʃuəl/ [n.礼仪]emphasizes conversation and presentation in a leisurely /'liʒɚli/ [adj.从容的] atmosphere. People take their time and enjoy a chat with their friends, often in the lobbies of grand hotels[高档酒店的大堂里] or in tearooms.

> Unlike the emphasis on presentation in British tea culture, Chinese tea culture emphasizes the virtues that come from within[内在美德], and a unity between human beings and nature[人与自然的合一感]. Chinese people also cherish the character of tea :fragrant but not aggressive[有芳香却不张扬],low-key but long lasting[低调而含韵悠长].

"Tradition" is more like maybe like society or something like...Okay, or like tradition could be like, a holiday could be a tradition.Right, we also say family tradition.Oh, it's our family tradition that we celebrate the holiday this way.

It's gonna come with jam and clotted cream. Okay so cream like comes from, like cows milk right?Yeah, it's like thick milk. I'm not an expert on how to make cream. It's delicious.Okay, so clotted cream is like a, it's a thick cream.So cream can usually be like a liquid, right? But clotted cream is more, well, it's solid.Yes, so if you, if you had it in a, in a glass or bowl, and you turn it upside down, it would stay in the bowl.Yeah, I mean eventually my, kind of slide out.

Okay cool, and then here, at this restaurant they're all loose leaf teas, not tea bags.That just means both tea leaves which does not in the bag. In England, very very commonly most of the tea that you will drink comes in a tea bag. It's not like China, China likes the loose leaf teas.Yeah yeah, I know in America too, yeah. When you go and buy tea in the store, they usually come in these little different bags, and each bag you know, you put in one cup and you can actually use it a couple times depending on the tea.
