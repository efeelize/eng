# I.Healthy and Delicious Thai Cuisine
> Thai food emphasizes lightly prepare dishes with strong aromatic /ˌærə'mætɪk/ [adj.芳香的] components and a spicy finish. It's famous for at least three or four fundamental tastes in each dish: sour, sweet, salty, bitter and spicy. David Thompson, an expert on Thai food, says that Thai food is about mixing and blending separate tastes to creat one harmonious taste. Thai chef McDang says that Thai cuisine has intricacy /'ɪntrɪkəsi/ [n.错综复杂], attention to detail, texture, color, taste, and the use of ingredients with medicinal benefits.

***Hi there. Any questions about the menu, or are you ready to order?***

***It’s our first time here. Do you have any recommendations?***

***Of course. To start, our appetizer platter is excellent. It features some of our most classic appetizers, including satay, shrimp cakes and spring rolls.***

***Oh, that sounds delightful. We'll get one to start.***

***And would you like some salad?***

***Sure. I was debating between the papaya and the pomelo salad.***

***I’d say go with the papaya salad. It’s chicken, shrimp, mint leaves and cashews tossed with papaya.It’s medium spicy. Most people are fine with it.***

***Ok, we’ll get that. And what’s in the pad thai?***

***That’s a trademark Thai dish. It’s fried noodles with tofu, eggs, peanuts, bean sprouts and chives. You’ll love it.***

***Oh, sounds delicious. We’ll get that, too. And, maybe one more curry dish.***

***I highly recommend the green chicken curry. It’s got basil and eggplant. Flavorful yet refreshing.***

***Ok, we’ll get it. I think that’ll do it for us!***

***Great! I’ll put in your order and be right back with some water for you.***
