# I.smart home safety tips
# 1.creat a secure Wi-Fi network
> Purchase a router from a reputable brand and follow the manufacturer's instructions to change the name of the network and default password. Choose a network name that doesn't automatically give away your location or personal details. Consider also hiding your network from view, an option which can usually be found in the router's settings menu.

> It's also possible to create a second Wi-Fi network specifically for your smart home devices. Many routers allow you to create multiple networks, each with their own name and password.

# 2.don't understimate the importance of your passwords
> It's incredible that the humble, old-fashioned password system is the main line of defense protecting our most high-tech devices. Take your passwords seriously! Whenever you get a new device, change the default password immediately. Otherwise, the password to your Wi-Fi router or security camera might be just a Google search away.

# 3.unplug devices that aren't in use
> When you leave home, unplug any appliances that won't be active. Not only will it save on your energy bill, it will also make them inaccessible to hackers. You'll probably want to leave important appliances like the security camera, video doorbell and the thermostat on, but you can unplug extra smart speakers, vacuums, etc.
