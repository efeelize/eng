# I.smart home safety tips
# 1.creat a secure Wi-Fi network
> Purchase a router from a reputable brand and follow the manufacturer's instructions to change the name of the network and default password. Choose a network name that doesn't automatically give away your location or personal details. Consider also hiding your network from view, an option which can usually be found in the router's settings menu.

> It's also possible to create a second Wi-Fi network specifically for your smart home devices. Many routers allow you to create multiple networks, each with their own name and password.

# 2.don't understimate the importance of your passwords
> It's incredible that the humble, old-fashioned password system is the main line of defense protecting our most high-tech devices. Take your passwords seriously! Whenever you get a new device, change the default password immediately. Otherwise, the password to your Wi-Fi router or security camera might be just a Google search away.

# 3.unplug devices that aren't in use
> When you leave home, unplug any appliances that won't be active. Not only will it save on your energy bill, it will also make them inaccessible to hackers. You'll probably want to leave important appliances like the security camera, video doorbell and the thermostat on, but you can unplug extra smart speakers, vacuums, etc.

# 2.facility
## 1）gadgets /ˈgæʤəts/ [n.小装置]
> gadgets are small devices that we have hand they always have special purpose.so when I think about gadgets, I think about all the different gadgets we can use in our kitchen. For example, you can have a blender. That's a gadget, but we can also have gadgets without electricity, like something that you use to crush garlic. That would be a gadget.

## 2）smart home [n.智能家居]
> a smart home is just a home with like security cameras,maybe light bulbs that turn on and off by themselevs.

## 3）the Internet of Things [n.物联网]
> So when we're talking about "the Internet of Things," we're talking about all these gadgets or things that we can use that use the internet.not computers, not smartphones, not those things. Things that shouldn't be connected to the internet like things in our home. Light switches, why would those be connected to the internet? Those things all together are called "the Internet of Things."

## 4）automated /ˈɑːt̬əmeɪtɪd/ [adj & v.使自动化]
> These smart home products are a type of gadget, and the more you put in your house, the more automated your house becomes.

> 2)If something is "automated," it means machines do it, so we don't have to do it.For example, when the car was invented, humans were making the cars, but then they made factories where machines made the cars. Now those factories are automated. So we can use it as a verb. Here it's a verb.I've automated my house. That means I have all these machines in my house, so I don't need to do anything. I can just be lazy.

- 1. Amazon has new automated grocery stores so you don't have to see a cashier.[亚马逊拥有全新的自动化食品杂货店，你不用去找收银员付款]

> 2)If something is "invasive," it means it comes into our personal space. It invades our personal space.

# 4.peace of mind [phr.内心的宁静] &  fumbling around [phr.笨手笨脚地做...]

> 2)When you fumble something it means you're doing it awkwardly, usually with your hands like you keep dropping it or something.it can also mean like you're trying to figure out how to do something or like how to use something.

# 5.connectivity /ˌkɑːnekˈtɪvət̬i/ [n.连接性] & connection
> 1)"connectivity" is being connected to the internet.we could talk about our wireless headphones having good connectivity.maybe it has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The more ways it can connect, the better connectivity it has. 

> 2)but it's not the same as the word "connection." So if my internet is going slow, I don't say my internet connectivity is slow, because connectivity also means the ways that my phone or computer can connect or its ability to connect.

# 6.compatibility /kəmˌpæt̬əˈbɪlət̬i/ [n.兼容性] 
> so this word "compatibility" basically just means how things work together. So we may have a lot of smart home products, like a smart speaker, a smart fridge, a smart lock, a smart security camera, but they need to work together, they need to be compatible in order to really be convenient.

- 1. Compatibility is one of the most important things when finding someone to settle down with.[想找一个可以安稳相伴的人，能否合得来是最重要的考量因素之一。]

# 9.eerie /ˈɪri/ [adj.怪异而令人恐惧的] & spooky [adj.]
> 1)it means strange and odd. But it also means like mysterious, like I don't know how that happened.So this is a feeling that maybe when you saw an ad and you're like "how does the computer know that I was talking about that."

> 2)a similar word is "spooky." It's like the feeling a ghost gives you, or when there's some really strange coincidence, and you get goosebumps. Woo,that's a weird eerie feeling.
