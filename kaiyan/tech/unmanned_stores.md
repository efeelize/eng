# I.Amazon opens its first unmanned store [无人超市]
> Chinese companies may have been first, beating the US online retail giant [零售巨头] in turning the concept into reality last year, but they have now become a reality [概念变成现实] in the USA as well. Amazon just opened a small cashier-less test [小型的无人商店] store in Seattle, Amazon Go, which opened to the public for the first time on January 22, 2018.

> “Unmanned stores are all about removing friction [消除摩擦] and increasing productivity. For some retail categories like convenience grocery [便利店] or fast food [快餐店], minimising time in-store [尽量减少在店时间]  makes a lot of sense.”

>  For now, the novelty /'nɑvlti/  [n.新颖] of Amazon's first automated grocery store is more important than issues that may come up in the future [让人们忽略了未来可能引起的问题]. Since [由于] it requires an account [账户] and a smartphone, it could be inaccessible to many lower-income shoppers. The tracking technology may also raise privacy and data collection concerns. And then on top of that, there's the issue of 3.5 million cashiers in the U.S. making around $9.70 an hour who could eventually lose their jobs to automation.

> In a CNN interview, a local shopper said, "At the end of the day, the people who are shaping the world work in technology, and they are more comfortable with automation instead of small talk with a cashier".

# II.grammar
# 1.eventually & finally
> 1)We use the adverb eventually to mean ‘in the end’, especially when something has involved a long time, or a lot of effort or problems.

- I looked everywhere for my keys, and eventually found them inside one of my shoes! (I found them after a long time and a lot of effort.

> 2)We use finally or lastly, not eventually, to refer to the last item in a list or the last point in a discussion.

- Finally, I think that the best way of facing and dealing with situations like these, is, as I have mentioned, to be diplomatic, nice, patient, sensible and to show respect.

- 1. After months of seeking a new job, he finally found one, and it was his dream job.

- 2. The manager finally apologized for his actions, but I thought he was a little insincere.

- 3. This essay might take me a while, but I’ll get it done eventually.

- 4. Eventually, everybody has to consider saving money for retirement.

***Tiffany, did you see there is a new unmanned convenience store down the road?***

***Oh, you mean one of those cashier-less stores? To be honest, I find those very gimmicky.***

***Jack Ma and Jeff Bezos both think it will redefine retail. It's an effective way to cut labor costs and deliver highly personalized shopping experiences.***

***It just seems so cold to me. I enjoy interacting with people.***

***I’ve always been an early adopter, so I’m excited to try it out. When I was in the States recently, I saw lots of Amazon lockers in Whole Foods. You can pick up your packages there.***

***That’s a big reason why Amazon acquired Whole Foods.***

***Alibaba and Tencent are doing similar things in China. Hey, I'm going to check out the new cashier-less store? Wanna go with me?***

***No. I have a ton of work to do. But let me know how it goes.***

***Justin, what took you so long?***

***Uh, some products were missing QR codes, so I couldn't pay. I eventually had to call a service hotline to get it to work.***

***Um, maybe it makes more sense to be a late adopter.***
