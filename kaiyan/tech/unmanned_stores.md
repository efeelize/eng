# unmanned stores
# I.Amazon opens its first unmanned store [无人超市]
> Chinese companies may have been first, beating the US online retail giant [零售巨头] in turning the concept into reality last year, but they have now become a reality [概念变成现实] in the USA as well. Amazon just opened a small cashier-less test [小型的无人商店] store in Seattle, Amazon Go, which opened to the public for the first time on January 22, 2018.

> “Unmanned stores are all about removing friction [消除摩擦] and increasing productivity. For some retail categories like convenience grocery [便利店] or fast food [快餐店], minimising time in-store [尽量减少在店时间]  makes a lot of sense.”

> For now, the novelty /'nɑvlti/  [n.新颖]of Amazon's first automated grocery store is more important than issues that may come up in the future [让人们忽略了未来可能引起的问题]. Since [由于] it requires an account [账户] and a smartphone,it could be inaccessible to many lower-income shoppers [将很多低收入者拒之门外].The tracking technology may also raise privacy and data collection concerns [引起隐私和数据收集的担忧]. And then on top of that [除此之外], there's the issue of 3.5 million [350万] cashiers [收银员] in the U.S making around $9.70 an hour [每小时收入] who could eventually lose their jobs to automation.

> In a CNN interview, a local shopper said, "At the end of the day [最终], the people who are shaping the world work in technology, and they are more comfortable with automation instead of small talk with a cashier".

# II.grammar
# 1.eventually & finally
> 1)We use the adverb eventually to mean ‘in the end’, especially when something has involved a long time, or a lot of effort or problems.

- I looked everywhere for my keys, and eventually found them inside one of my shoes! (I found them after a long time and a lot of effort.

> 2)We use finally or lastly, not eventually, to refer to the last item in a list or the last point in a discussion.

- Finally, I think that the best way of facing and dealing with situations like these, is, as I have mentioned, to be diplomatic, nice, patient, sensible and to show respect.

- 1. After months of seeking a new job, he finally found one, and it was his dream job.

- 2. The manager finally apologized for his actions, but I thought he was a little insincere.

- 3. This essay might take me a while, but I’ll get it done eventually.

- 4. Eventually, everybody has to consider saving money for retirement.

# 2.unmanned 
> 1)unmanned submarine:so there would be no people on it.No people on the submarine because sometimes it can be dangerous.

> 2)A lot of drones are unmanned.

# 3. cashier-less [adj.无收银员的] & convenience store [n.便利店]
> 1)So generally speaking the people working in convenience stores, not all of them but most of them, are also the cashiers.The cashiers they, when you go to check out, when you go pay for your products, you go to the cashier while these ones are cashier-less.there are no cashiers in this store.

> 2)if you look at the dialogue there's a dash. Because cashier-less is not a real word, it's not in the dictionary so whenever we make a new word we sometimes put a dash like that.

> 3)And just a quick note here, convenience store not  convenient store. That would be a little difference there.

# 4.gimmicky [adj.噱头的] & gimmick
> 1)There's a lot of these, ok with all the new technology these days and all of the different functions that we can get in like physical stores, people want to take the people out of the stores and make them automated.

> 2)So we often see the words like sales gimmick it's just to get attention.a gimmick is just kind of like a trick.It's just for attracting your attention.So like my actually my friend told me yesterday, when he found out I could sing Chinese songs, he said, "that's a pretty good gimmick".you can use it to attract attention.

# 5.redefine [v.重新定义]
> redefine. So we've seen this, you all know what the word definition, and the word define is like, to change the meaning or make the meaning of something.but in this case it's more like changing the way people think about something.and all of these like Silicon Valley tech guys.They always like we're gonna redefine shopping, we're gonna redefine transportation, we're gonna redefine public transportation.like a common example I think of is Facebook, the social media platforms, they've redefined the word "friend".

# 6.early adopter [n.早期尝试着] & late adopter [phr.对新事物慢热的人]
> 1）so we're using adopter because it means you're choosing or accepting something or you're starting something new.so this phrase always comes up in tech: early adopters.And the thing about being an early adopter is you you know that it's going to be more expensive.So you're willing to pay the you like that extra premium just to be the first.you're kind of taking a risk in that way.

> 2)We often talk about governments adopting policies.Or if you're trying to quit a habit you need to adopt some new behavior.And of course there's also adopting children.of course that's kind of one of the basic meanings of this word.

> 3)You see I also did not buy the iPhone right away, I thought they were kind of stupid.gimmicky. Interacting with your phone too much so I was a late adopter but now I am. 

# 7.gym/school lockers 
> School locker or a luggage locker at the airport stood as a storage container.You put it in and lock it up.

# 8.pick (sth) up [v.取、接送]
> 1)so pick up that just basically means get.it's pretty casual. It doesn't take a lot of time. Pick it up quickly.I don't have time so I'm gonna pick up some take out.

> 2)I mean even just at the airport, it's nice to have somebody waiting at the airport to pick you up.Pick you up like that for sure. probably in a car.

> 3)but I mean we do use this phrase all the time, because it is a phrasal verb, just be careful you can always pick something up pick someone up. Pick up your friend but you can't pick up it.

# 9.acquired [v.收购] & acquired knowledge/experiences
> 1)We use this for companies when they buy another company. Like Facebook has acquired Snapchat.And basically that is one of the main definitions of this word, it's a legal one. So you have you can acquire a company means you bought it, it's now yours.

> 2)You can acquire the rights to do something.But of course there's another one that we always use which is just acquire knowledge.It just means get basically.The most importantly here guys is there is no such word as "knowledges".it is an uncountable noun and so yeah there's no such "knowledges".Now one of the things that you can acquire is experience. You can also aquire experiences. That can be counted.different experiences that you had in different places.

# 10.a ton of
> I would say guys if you do want to say this phrase and you probably do, you're probably very busy. We don't really say ton "of" homework.It's usually ton of homework or ton of things I gotta do.

# 11.what took you so long 
> it means  "why did this take such a long time?"I mean if you're joking to your friend who you always joke with that's fine. But yeah what took you so long? Why did you take it a long time I'm angry or something, maybe.

# 12.QR codes [二维码]
> QR code, it's black and white.And it's square.There's a sometimes a kitty in the middle or like a picture of the person's WeChat.you use it to log into WeChat on the web or Baidu anyway. Yeah, it just means quick response code.

# 13.eventually [adv.最终] & finally
> 1）eventually. When I'm telling a story and that story involves me kind of like this happened and then this happened eventually. I had to go do this.It kind of has a bit of a turn, I'm on the path. I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying. But it didn't actually work. So eventually I had to change my plan.

> 2) finally, It's a positive thing. His first intention succeeded basically. So if he found the QR codes you could say, I finally found the QR codes. But just to be clear, it could have taken a while, like sometimes I get lost pretty easily, And I'm trying to find Connor's place, I can't find it. finally I found it.
