# 1.News & Politics
> Opinion columnists [专栏作家] David Leonhardt, Michelle Goldberg and Ross Douthat debate every week on a different, timely topic [当下话题]. Though some stances /stɑ:ns/ [观点] will surely infuriate /ɪn'fjʊrɪet/ [激怒] listeners, everyone will learn how the other side thinks.

# 2.Interview
> The premise is simple: Comedian Chris Gethard talks on the phone to an anonymous listener for one hour. In each episode, Gethard offers a master class in empathy [展现强大的共情能力]. He subtly encourages callers to share more details about their lives while remaining respectful of their privacy.

# II.the streaming media wars:a win for consumers
# 1.More Content Than Ever Before
> Over-the-top (OTT) streaming [OTT传输] and all those binge-watching sessions are only possible because of advancements in the transcoding /træns'kəud/ [内容转码], delivery and playback of content [回放]. Consumers are generally no longer forced to pay sky-high [高昂] cable prices [有线电视费用] for preset programming schedules.

# III.popular mobile live streaming apps
# 1.facebook live
> As we are all aware of Facebook is more than [不仅仅是] a social networking platform, so its service is not only limited to social networking. At the initial phase, facebook live streaming services were made available only to popular actors and performers.

> But that's not the case anymore as every fb user can use the live streaming services. When you open the screen at the bottom you can see the viewer comments. Live streams on Facebook Live can be watched on the web as well as on the official Facebook app. 

> Sharing live videos with all your friends or specific group is also possible. All you have to do is just tap the Live button under the status update to start the broadcast. After tapping the first thing you'll see is sharing video with yourself, but you can quickly change it to public or specific group of friends.[快速将其改为公开或特定朋友可见]

# 2.instagram live stories

## 1)subscribe /səbˈskraɪb/ [v.订阅] & subscriptions /səbˈskrɪpʃənz/ 订阅
> 1)you can just hit subscribe and it will give you every single update.And one thing we want to say about this word "subscribe" because you probably heard it before in the sense of "subscribe to media," is we often use it to mean like "believe."like you could subscribe to a specific idea.so you could say, "I subscribe to the idea of free healthcare for everybody."

> 2)So if you are like a member of something, you pretty much have a subscription. Except for things like, if you go to the gym, you wouldn't say you have a gym subscription.It is usually for media or content that you can consume, not necessarily a place that you go.In that case, you probably just be a member. But here, more and more people are going for the streaming services subscriptions and "is causing the film industry to restructure."

## 10）cord-cutting [断线（引申为观众不再看有线电视）]
> But cord-cutting, that started at least ten or twenty years ago when people just got tired of these really expensive cable packages.So they started cutting the cord, meaning they were getting rid of their cable subscriptions. And then this's led to like I said some "drastic shifts" in the market.

# 4.streaming
## 1)hopping on the bandwagon /ˈbændˌwæɡən/ [phr.顺应潮流；跟风]

So when you gain traction, you're moving upwards and you're not going back anymore.

> 2)we can use this when we're talking about a product being introduced to the market. Maybe, not a lot of people like it at first, but eventually it starts to gain traction. Or in this case, a podcast gains listeners.

## 5)appealing [v.吸引] & attract 
> 1)When I think of "appeal," I think of like the senses. Maybe it appeals to my sight. It looks really good,the colors are pretty.

> 1)spawned basically means to give birth,to procreate,but it's not really a word that we use with humans very much.we mostly use this with like fish,turtles.so we wouldn't want to say,like my spawn.unless you're joking.

## 8)drastic [adj.剧烈的、彻底的] & drastic improvement

## 9)plethora /ˈpleθɚə/ [n.过多]
> it means a lot.

# 5.esoteric /ˌesəˈterɪk/ [adj.只有少数人（尤指内行）才懂的，难懂的] & accessible /əkˈsesəbəl/ 可以理解的；易懂的
> 1)Esoteric," this means that it was not very accessible, because it is mostly made by geeks for geeks.let's imagine that for a second. Geeks are really good at knowing things that most people don't know.So they have a lot of esoteric knowledge. That's one way you can use this word, and if something is esoteric, it's really not accessible to the public.people could be esoteric,or the language that they use could be esoteric.

# 6.exhaustive /ɪɡˈzɑːstɪv/ [adj.详尽无遗的，全面的] & exhausting / ɪɡˈzɔstɪŋ/ [adj.精疲力尽的]
> 1)so they're really complete,they include everything.but exhaustive itself is not negative.

# 9.to restructure [v.重新建构] & cosmetic change
> 1)so "to restructure" basically means to change.like change the nature of something, the shape.So this is not just some small change. We can say . It's a fundamental change.it's a really big change basically. You can think about it like this, for years and years and years, people have been watching TV through their cable subscriptions, but now the whole game is changing. It is "restructuring" because of the streaming services.

> 2)One more thing about "restructuring." They love to use this word at work. If the company is restructuring, it basically means that a bunch of people are getting fired.

# V.pattern
***It seems like there's a podcast for everything these days from journalism to amateur reviews.***

***Tell me about it. The lists are exhaustive. When it started in the early 2000s, it was super geeky and esoteric.***

***Yeah, now it's gone really mainstream. So what spurred the explosion?***

***Well, in 2014, podcasts gained traction, appealing to listeners with suspense and storytelling.***

***Wasn't that when "Serial" emerged and spawned a plethora of similar podcasts? It was really intimate and gripping.***

***Yeah! Being able to subscribe to podcasts makes it more personalized and engaging too.***

***True, and that engagement drives the monetization.***

***Speaking of which, China has a really interesting, alternative model.***

***It's more of a "pay-for-knowledge" model than an ad-driven model, right?***

***Yeah, people actually pay for content since a lot of it is skill-based.***

***Hmm… maybe we could start our own podcast and cash in?***

***Haha! Well I'm not sure if that'll work here, but it can't hurt to try.***

# IV.pattern
***I swear, every day there's a new streaming service coming out.***

***It's true. But companies like Netflix and Hulu have been around for ages. It's funny that everyone else is just hopping on the bandwagon now.***

***Yeah, well the fact that more and more consumers are opting out of their cable subscriptions for streaming services is causing the film industry to restructure.***

***That must be why Disney+ and Apple TV+ came out not too long ago. I bet traditional broadcasting and TV advertising have suffered a huge blow too.***

***Sure have. Cord-cutting has led to drastic shifts in the market, which is why telecom giants AT&T and Comcast will be coming out with their own streaming services this year too.***

***Sounds like they're trying to get a piece of the pie as well. I'm just not sure how much more room there is for market penetration.***

***I agree. I mean who has the time to watch all these new shows, let alone pay for all these different services?***

***You'd be surprised. Besides, that's how these companies get you: they hook you in by offering original series that are exclusive to their streaming service.***

***That reminds me. I need to renew my Amazon Video account.***
