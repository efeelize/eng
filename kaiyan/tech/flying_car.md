# I.Japan's first flying car:SD-03

> The flying SD-03 demonstration took place on Aug. 25 at the Toyota Test Field in Japan, where SkyDrive develops its products, according to the company's news release. This occasion also serves as the country's first public manned flying car test, which took place two years after SkyDrive was formally launched.
