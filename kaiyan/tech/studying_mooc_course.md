***Hey Jack, I heard from Bill you are doing an online course. What do they call those things now, MOOPs?***

***Not MOOP, MOOC! Massive Open Online Course.***

***Oh right. So are there lots of these MOOCs?***

***Seems like there are more and more every day. The more established ones include companies like Coursera, which offers courses from Ivy League schools. There are also ones like Udacity and Udemy: They both offer more practical skills with a focus on the technology industry.***

***So is everything online?***

***Yeah. That's the appeal of MOOC's: flexibility and convenience. You can really do it on your own terms. I work full time, so a MOOC course is a lot more feasible for me than going to class in person.***

***I'm not sure if I have the discipline to finish an online course. In a face to face class, at least you know you have to show up. Plus, there's also the human element. I mean do you even get a real teacher with these MOOC courses?***

***The course I'm doing doesn't have an instructor. But some do. The study material is basically videos which I can go through on my own time. I can discuss my studies with other people doing the same course. We help each other out with problems and questions.***

***I see. How are you finding it so far?***

***I'm pretty satisfied. I mean the course I'm doing is Specialized App Development, which is not available in most schools. MOOCs are pretty much the only decent option when it comes to learning new skills such as these.***

***How long is the course? Do you get a degree at the end?***

***My course is self-paced, study as you go. I won't get a degree from it, but some of the more structured courses do give you a certification or what they call a 'nanodegree'.***

***Geez, you and your buzzwords! I'm already MOOC'd out!***
