# I.What is a smart speaker?
> If we're being really pedantic /pɪ'dæntɪk/ [adj.学术一点], a speaker capable of anything beyond just emitting /ɪ'mɪt/ [vt.发出] sound can be technically labelled as "smart".

> So the fact wireless speakers feature Bluetooth, NFC, speakerphone abilities [免提通话等功能] and can be controlled by apps already make them pretty smart.

> But in general [通常来说], and because the tech industry is going with this description, "smart speakers" are wireless speakers with voice-control [声控功能] built into them. Basically, if you can shout commands [下口头指令] at your wireless speaker to make it do things, it’s a smart speaker.

> Smart speakers tend to be single-unit wireless speakers [单机无线音箱] and have artificial intelligence (AI) from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft or Samsung (so far) built into them.

> These come in the form of voice-controlled personal assistants [声控形式的个人助理], with the most popular being Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Google Assistant. Apple’s Siri is, of course, the brains behind the HomePod speaker, while Microsoft's Cortana and Samsung's Bixby are the lesser known AIs.
