# I.What is a smart speaker?
> If we're being really pedantic /pɪ'dæntɪk/ [adj.学术一点], a speaker capable of anything beyond just emitting /ɪ'mɪt/ [vt.发出] sound can be technically labelled as "smart".

> So the fact wireless speakers feature Bluetooth, NFC, speakerphone abilities [免提通话等功能] and can be controlled by apps already make them pretty smart.

> But in general [通常来说], and because the tech industry is going with this description, "smart speakers" are wireless speakers with voice-control [声控功能] built into them. Basically, if you can shout commands [下口头指令] at your wireless speaker to make it do things, it’s a smart speaker.

> Smart speakers tend to be single-unit wireless speakers [单机无线音箱] and have artificial intelligence (AI) from Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft or Samsung (so far) built into them.

> These come in the form of voice-controlled personal assistants [声控形式的个人助理], with the most popular being Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Google Assistant. Apple’s Siri is, of course, the brains behind the HomePod speaker, while Microsoft's Cortana and Samsung's Bixby are the lesser known AIs.

# II.grammar
# 1.don’t let something fool you
> People often use the phrase “don’t let something fool you” when some quality is different than it seems or appears. It can be used to say that something is better than it seems or worse than it seems. Here are some examples:

- 1. Don't let the price fool you. Just because it's expensive does not mean that it's better quality.

- 2. Don't let the material fool you. It's more comfortable than it looks.

- 3. Don't let her appearance fool you. She's stronger than you'd expect.

***Hi there. Is there anything I can help you find?***

***I'm looking for a new smart speaker for my husband's birthday.***

***Oh, he'll love that. The most popular ones are from Amazon and Google. Apple also has one, but it only works with an iPhone.***

***I've heard Amazon's has some cool functions and features.***

***It's an amazing little device. Their voice assistant Alexa is great for home automation. You can control almost anything in your house, and even order groceries.***

***That's handy. But does it have Bluetooth?***

***Absolutely! It's 2019, isn't it? So, which model would you be interested in?***

***Nothing fancy, just something my husband can use for music or podcasts.***

*** Then their flagship Amazon Echo would be perfect. It's small, but don't let the size fool you. It has plenty of rich, room-filling sound.***

***Oh, sounds great. Maybe I'll make it a present for both of us.***

***Haha, just don't tell him that.***
