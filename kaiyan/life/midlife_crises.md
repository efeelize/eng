# III.pattern
***Hey Luna, how did car shopping with your dad go?***

***Well, he's dead-set on buying a sleek little red sports car now. Midlife crisis much?***

***You know midlife crises are just a social construct right?***

***Oh, here we go again with "social construct this" and "postmodern that."***

***I'm serious! Psychological research has pretty much all but rejected this as a concept.***

***But don't people at roughly the same age face the same stressors with the same outcomes?***

***Sure, but what the research challenges is the premise that these all constitute a shared experience.***

***So my dad's last-ditch effort to regain his youthfulness isn't universal?***

***People living in poverty or people of color face stress all their lives. Just starting to face it in your 50s is a sign of immense privilege.***

***I've never thought about it that way. So why is this concept so pervasive?***

***I think for a lot of people it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.***

***Well I just hope that my dad's newfound lust for life doesn't persuade him to get a girlfriend to go along with his new ride!***
