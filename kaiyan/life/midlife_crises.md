# 1.Check your hormone levels [激素水平]

# 2.Evaluate your approach to diet and fitness
> As we age, we tend to become a bit more sedentary [坐着的时间更长], and as metabolism slows [新陈代谢放缓], we can begin to feel our youthful vigor slipping away [年轻的活力正在消失]. A healthy and balanced diet and a regular exercise regimen can help alleviate [缓解] many of the symptoms of midlife crisis .

# 4.Communicate your needs
> Keeping the midlife crisis feelings bottled up [憋在心里] can cause a lot of stress. Talk to a trusted friend or mentor. Share appropriate feelings with your spouse or partner. Then listen to the good advice from the people who care about you.

# II.grammar
# 1.this...that...
> 1)You can use the same word before "this" and "that." For example, he's always talking about "money this and money that." But you can also change one of the words, like we see in today's dialogue: "social construct this" and "postmodern that."

> 2)the way that we're using it here today, it's complaining and it's typically complaining about someone talking about something too much.so it's a good little way to complain.you don't have to complain about your friends,you can talk about your boss or your job.

- 1. I find his optimism exhausting. His books are all technology this and future that. 我觉得他的乐观主义让人筋疲力尽。他的书都是关于科技这个、未来那个的。 

- 2. He's always going on about fishing this or camping that. 他总是唠叨着要么钓鱼要么露营什么的。 

- 3. I'm so bored with superhero movies. It's always "aliens attack" this or "time travel" that. 我太厌烦超级英雄电影了，总是“外星人攻击”或者“时间旅行”什么的。

# 2....+much
> adding much to the end of a sentence is just a way to sort of criticize sth or show your disapproval of it by sort of mocking it.you're basically saying,"this is absolutely the thing that I just mentioned."for example, your friend is always late for work. "Late for work much, Johnny?" So it's just funny. It's a fairly new usage, so people will be using it all the time. Now, we need to talk about Leo's position on midlife crises.

# 3.social construct [社会建构产物，社会建构概念] & constitute [v.构成]
> 1)when we say something is a social construct, what we're really trying to say is that it's not natural.So it's human-made. Or you could say it's made from society, so it's a social construct. humans are social creatures. Everything that we do, we do because we live in a society, meaning comes from societies. 

- 1. The idea of what constitutes a happy life of course varies from person to person. [当然，是什么构成了幸福生活这个想法因人而异]

- 2. In order to constitute fraud, a person must have the intention to deceive. [要构成欺诈，一个人必须有欺骗的意图]

- 3. Today we'd like to further discuss what constitutes harassment in the workplace. [今天我们想进一步探讨一下什么是职场骚扰]

> 2)So "constitute" here just means like it added up to this thing.Or we will hear this word a lot in law where they will talk about a legal concept like "fraud." So now, I've been asking Johnny for some money. Maybe I'm actually trying to rip him off.And then he tries to sue me afterwards, but then my lawyer, he comes and he says, "That doesn't constitute fraud. In order to constitute fraud, a person must have the intention to deceive, and Adam would never try to deceive you." That is a false premise.

- The idea of what constitutes a happy life, of course, varies from person to person.

# 4.stressors /ˈstresɚs/ [n.压力来源，导致紧张的事件] 
> this is basically a thing that causes stress.and often these things make us go through a midlife crisis.At this point in a person's age, you know, he or she probably has kids as well. They need to send the kids to school.maybe again at work, there might not be a lot more room to advance so yeah, money would be a huge stressor here. Again, the body is changing, so there's all kinds of stressors.

# 5.premise /ˈpremɪs/ [（作为先决条件的）假定，前提]  
> so it's like an idea pretty much,it's a building block of a bigger idea like an argument.we hear a lot about this in academics.when people are talking about theories as well like,for example,a lot of people believe the premise that the earth was flat.But then,came around science and technology, and people started to challenge that premise because they realized it was leading to a lot of false conclusions.

# 6.last-ditch /ˈdɪtʃ/ effort/attempt [adj.最后一招的，孤注一掷的]

> 1）usually between the ages of 45 and 55, when men or women worry about getting old, and they start doing things to feel young again.Now, we're saying midlife crisis, but if you wanna make it plural and talk about it in a general sense, you can say crises.

> 2)on the other hand, we were thinking about a time in our lives that although has a lot of meaning around it, is quite natural, and that's puberty, when you go from being a child to a teenager. We are all told that we are going to have a midlife crisis.So when we reach our midlives, we kind of think, "Hey, I guess I'm having a crisis."this is what society told me. 
 
> 3)Youth is a time in our lives. 

> 4)"youthfulness" is just that spirit that you have. You're like a child.youthfulness isn't connected to our age. It's more connected to our attitude or the way we see things.it can be positive,it can be negative.

- a lot of people in midlife crises, they're trying to do one thing and one thing only, and that is to regain their youthfulness.So a lot of people say,

- he didn't get the job because of his youthfulness.

# 8.privilege /ˈprɪvəlɪdʒ/ [n.特权，特别待遇]

> 2)But it is a word that gets used a lot in academia these days as well.

- 1. It's a tremendous privilege for me to announce the list of this year's nominees. [能宣布今年的提名名单，是我极大的荣幸]

s
# 9.pervasive /pɚˈveɪsɪv/ [adj.普遍的，盛行的]
> so if something's "pervasive," it's very widespread. And we usually use this to talk about negative things.So an idea or a false understanding of something could be pervasive.Like the earth was flat was a pervasive idea at one time.

# 10.self-fulfilling prophecy /ˈprɑːfəsi/ [n.自证预言]

- 3. Why are so many modern rational people obsessed with doomsday prophecies? [为什么有那么多现代理性人痴迷于世界末日的预言？]

# 11.lust /lʌst/ [n.渴望] for life  
> And it's a good phrase to use to describe people that are just full of energy and very positive.lust is sth that young people feel a lot,it's very emotional,when you're going through puberty.You have a lot of lust. That's for sure. People have a lust for power or a lust for wealth. It's like an uncontrollable desire for those things, but here a lust for life is not negative. It's quite positive.

# 12.dead-set on (doing)sth
> it just means that this person really really want to do that thing.it's kind of negative in some sense because it kind of implies that he's not very flexible.if it's not flexible,then he's gonna end up with nothing.

# III.pattern
***Hey Luna, how did car shopping with your dad go?***

***Well, he's dead-set on buying a sleek little red sports car now. Midlife crisis much?***

***You know midlife crises are just a social construct right?***

***Oh, here we go again with "social construct this" and "postmodern that."***

***I'm serious! Psychological research has pretty much all but rejected this as a concept.***

***But don't people at roughly the same age face the same stressors with the same outcomes?***

***Sure, but what the research challenges is the premise that these all constitute a shared experience.***

***So my dad's last-ditch effort to regain his youthfulness isn't universal?***

***People living in poverty or people of color face stress all their lives. Just starting to face it in your 50s is a sign of immense privilege.***

***I've never thought about it that way. So why is this concept so pervasive?***

***I think for a lot of people it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.***

***Well I just hope that my dad's newfound lust for life doesn't persuade him to get a girlfriend to go along with his new ride!***
