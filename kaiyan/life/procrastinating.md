# I.tips to stop procrastinating
# 1.consider the big picture
> Humans are wired to consider the needs of the present much more strongly than the needs of the future. The remedy is to take on a broader perspective rather than nit-picking the details. Look at everyday tasks through the lens of a bigger picture. Taking on a new perspective can jump-start the process of taking action.

# 2.untangle performance and self-worth
> Perfectionism and procrastination are linked, but the sky-high standards mixed with a belief that your performance is tied to your self-worth can grind you to a halt. Always remember the crucial difference between who you are and what you achieve. There's so much more to your worth than your accomplishments.

# 3.know yourself
> Some people may use procrastination as a motivation. Active procrastination is more strategic. Those of us who work better under pressure and prefer the adrenaline rush and intense focus that comes with a close deadline might choose to start later. The lesson here is know thyself. If the high-pressure intensity of all-nighters works for you, go ahead and make that pot of coffee and crack on with the work at midnight.

# II.grammar
# 1.procrastination idioms
## 1)to nip ths problem in the bud
> it means to deal with sth or take care of it early and before it gets bigger and becomes a big problem. A "bud" is a flower in its early stage of growth, before it has opened up. If we "nip a flower bud," that means we cut the bud before it has a chance to grow larger. This is where the idiom comes from.

## 2)on the back burner [phr.拖延搁置]
> If something is on the back burner, like work or a decision, then it is temporarily not being dealt with or considered, especially because it is not urgent or important. For example, "Let's put this work on the back burner so we can focus on that assignment our boss gave us."

## 3)grab the bull by the horns [phr.当机立断]
> If we grab/take the bull by the horns, it means we deal with a difficult situation in a very direct or confident way. It's the opposite of procrastination. For example, "I was tired of waiting for my company to offer me a raise, so I grabbed the bull by the horns and asked my manager for one."

# III.pattern
***Mike, I know I should do my work, but I just can't stop procrastinating. Am I just lazy?***

***No, you're probably just using procrastination as a coping mechanism. Deferring work helps people deal with negative emotions induced by certain tasks.***

***I am a perfectionist, so my fear of failing could be fueling this.***

***That's common. Getting rid of negative behavior that stems from this thinking should help rectify the situation.***

***Like spending too much time endlessly planning what to do, and not enough time taking action?***

***Yep, or wasting time on easy, low-priority work because it gives you instant gratification, but doesn't help accomplish long-term goals.***

***Ok, but I also need a way to reinforce my positive behavior so I can stay on track.***

***Try incentivizing your brain with bigger and better rewards, and give yourself lots of praise when you finish something challenging.***

***Smart. I'll get started on these things, soon, I hope.***

***You should definitely nip this problem in the bud. It will help you alleviate your stress throughout the day.***
