# prenup
# I.4 things you should know about prenups
# 1.what does a prenup reallly include?
> A prenup will generally specify splitting of assets, wealth and debt, but they can also include a number of lifestyle clauses. Among them, who gets custody of the pets (note: custody arrangements for children are beyond the purview of a prenup). 

# 2.But we have no money!Do we need one?
> A prenup can be helpful to a partner with fewer assets. For example, if you quit your job to raise children, a prenup could specify that you get additional financial support from your spouse, since you may have a harder time finding new employment.

# 3.How much will this cost?
> An attorney will charge you by the hour for drafting a prenup, and the total cost varies widely. According to an attorney in New York, "If your finances are straightforward, you can expect to pay between $1,200 and $2,400 in total."

# 4.Is a prenup set in stone?
> It's changeable,as long as you both agree to it.you'd just revoke the previous agreement,and creat a new one.

- If, heaven forbid, I get fired, I'll find another job. (“if” is optional)[如果我被解雇了，我会另找一份工作。(原句中if可省略)]

## 2)Before a clause
- Heaven forbid, I get fired! (comma is optional)[但愿我不会被解雇。(原句中逗号可省略)]

## 3)As an exclamation
- A: I hope I don't get fired. B: Heaven forbid![A: 我希望我不会被解雇。B:但愿不会如此！]

## 4）In the subjunctive mood [虚拟语气]
- If, heaven forbid, I got fired, I'd find another job.[如果我被解雇了，我会另找一份工作]

## 5)With a "that" conjunction:[用于“that”之前]
- Heaven forbid that I get fired![但愿我不会被解雇]

# III.pattern
***, Matt. I might add Tom's name to my house before we get married. If so, should I get a prenup?***

***Definitely. Gotta preserve your premarital assets and inheritances.***

***I'm still ambivalent about it. We're planning a wedding, not a divorce. Tom is the one, not the next one!***

***Then you have nothing to lose. It's like car insurance; hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.***

***I just don't want it to cause grudges or friction. And I thought it was only for rich people.***

***It's popular with millennials since they're getting married after they've accumulated some wealth.***

***Well, heaven forbid, we get divorced. If that happened, we'd divvy up our things amicably. Jeff Bezos did that. I trust Tom to do the same.***

***That's good in theory, but people change. Also, it doesn't just protect your assets; it protects you from liabilities.***

***I suppose it's better than hoping for a good postnup.***

***Yeah, don't forget that marriage is a legal contract with legal ramifications.***

***I guess we'd better bite the bullet and get one.***
