# I.4 things you should know about prenups

# III.pattern
***, Matt. I might add Tom's name to my house before we get married. If so, should I get a prenup?***

***Definitely. Gotta preserve your premarital assets and inheritances.***

***I'm still ambivalent about it. We're planning a wedding, not a divorce. Tom is the one, not the next one!***

***Then you have nothing to lose. It's like car insurance; hoping for the best, preparing for the worst.***

***I just don't want it to cause grudges or friction. And I thought it was only for rich people.***

***It's popular with millennials since they're getting married after they've accumulated some wealth.***

***Well, heaven forbid, we get divorced. If that happened, we'd divvy up our things amicably. Jeff Bezos did that. I trust Tom to do the same.***

***That's good in theory, but people change. Also, it doesn't just protect your assets; it protects you from liabilities.***

***I suppose it's better than hoping for a good postnup.***

***Yeah, don't forget that marriage is a legal contract with legal ramifications.***

***I guess we'd better bite the bullet and get one.***
