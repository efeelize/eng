# III.pattern
***Hey Glen, I'm so glad spring is finally here. I feel like I've been in hibernation forever!***

***Yeah, I really struggled this past winter. I went a little stir-crazy.***

***Didn't we all? Personally, I really suffer from seasonal affective disorder, so all that spring sunlight really helps rejuvenate me.***

***I was hoping for the same. But to be honest, I haven't noticed much change.***

***Perhaps you're not out and about enough? Sun exposure increases serotonin and decreases melatonin,leaving you happier and more energized.***

***Well, when you explain the science behind it, I can see why I haven't fully reaped the benefits!***

***The change of season won't flick a magic switch by itself. Just get out more! Socializing and exercising can really boost your mood!***

***True. Or maybe I need to do some spring cleaning. I've always found decluttering to be very cathartic.***

***Haha. It is, but why are we still talking on the phone? The weather is gorgeous! Let's go out and soak it up while we can.***
