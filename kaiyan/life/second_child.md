# I.Things you need to know about maternity leave in the U.S.
# 1.How can you ask about benefits when you’re interviewing for a job, without implying you’re going to get pregnant soon?

> In an ideal world, you’d be able to ask about maternity leave in interviews. In practice, there’s a very real chance that employers will read that as a signal that you plan to get pregnant soon and be less inclined to hire you. Instead, the better time to ask is once you have a job offer.

# 2. Do you get paid for maternity leave?
> Unfortunately, according to the only federal law guaranteeing maternity leave in the U.S., maternity leave is unpaid. The law will protect your job for up to [保有原工作] 12 weeks after childbirth or adoption.

# 3. How does maternity leave work if it’s unpaid?
> Despite the crappy [差劲] federal laws on maternity leave, some employers do offer paid leave of their own volition, so check your company’s policies. But typically people try to save up their vacation and sick time [将年假和病假节省下来], and then use it to cover all or part of the time they’re on leave [用这些假期来覆盖部分或者全部产假].

***Hey, Jayce. Now, that China has a two-child policy. Have you thought about having a second child?***

***Honestly, as an only child growing up, I’ve always had this ingrained idea that “one is enough." But, these days I’ve been coming around to the idea.***

***Oh yeah? What’s changed your mind?***

***A couple of things. For one, we’ve got a shrinking workforce and an aging population.***

***Fair, but I assume that’s not the main reason.***

***No, definitely not. My wife and I both think my son could use some company. Having a sibling might also bring out his nurturing side.***

***As the eldest of three siblings, I can vouch for that, so what’s holding you back?***

***Well, It’s hard enough juggling work and one kid, let alone two kids.***

***True. The surging cost of childcare and living would be an added pressure too.***

***Yup. My wife is also concerned that a second maternity leave might hurt her career.***

***Mmm...and if you can’t find affordable help, she may have to put it on ice indefinitely.***

***Exactly. But, as much as we’d love another bundle of joy, we aren’t in any rush. So, we’ll just wait until the time is right.***
