***Hey, Jayce. Now, that China has a two-child policy. Have you thought about having a second child?***

***Honestly, as an only child growing up, I’ve always had this ingrained idea that “one is enough." But, these days I’ve been coming around to the idea.***

***Oh yeah? What’s changed your mind?***

***A couple of things. For one, we’ve got a shrinking workforce and an aging population.***

***Fair, but I assume that’s not the main reason.***

***No, definitely not. My wife and I both think my son could use some company. Having a sibling might also bring out his nurturing side.***

***As the eldest of three siblings, I can vouch for that, so what’s holding you back?***

***Well, It’s hard enough juggling work and one kid, let alone two kids.***

***True. The surging cost of childcare and living would be an added pressure too.***

***Yup. My wife is also concerned that a second maternity leave might hurt her career.***

***Mmm...and if you can’t find affordable help, she may have to put it on ice indefinitely.***

***Exactly. But, as much as we’d love another bundle of joy, we aren’t in any rush. So, we’ll just wait until the time is right.***
