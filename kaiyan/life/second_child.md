# I.Things you need to know about maternity leave in the U.S.

# 1.How can you ask about benefits when you’re interviewing for a job, without implying you’re going to get pregnant soon?
> In an ideal world, you’d be able to ask about maternity leave in interviews. In practice, there’s a very real chance that employers will read that as a signal that you plan to get pregnant soon and be less inclined to hire you. Instead, the better time to ask is once you have a job offer.

# 2. Do you get paid for maternity leave?
> Unfortunately, according to the only federal law guaranteeing maternity leave in the U.S., maternity leave is unpaid. The law will protect your job for up to [保有原工作] 12 weeks after childbirth or adoption.

# 3. How does maternity leave work if it’s unpaid?
> Despite the crappy [差劲] federal laws on maternity leave, some employers do offer paid leave of their own volition, so check your company’s policies. But typically people try to save up their vacation and sick time [将年假和病假节省下来], and then use it to cover all or part of the time they’re on leave [用这些假期来覆盖部分或者全部产假].

# II.grammar
# 1.let alone
> “Let alone” is a phrase that indicates that a second option is more difficult or less probable than the first option. Although it’s predominantly used in a negative sense, it can also be used positively to express that something unexpected actually happened.

- 1. He wasn’t able to handle one job, let alone two.

- 2. I wouldn’t trust her to look after a pet, let alone a child.

- 3. I never thought I would leave my home country, let alone travel all over the world.

# 2.one/two-child policy & bundle of joy /ˈbʌndəl/ [新生儿] & terrible twos [可怕的两岁]
> 1)we normally say one-child policy or two-child policy. just keep in mind, when we're talking about this policy or rather the evolution of this policy, we don't say only-children policy or two-children policy.

> 2)a two-year-old is a bundle of joy said “no mother ever”.we call those terrible twos.

# 3.mat/maternity /mə'tɝnəti/ leave [产假]  & maternity ward /wɔ:rd/ [产科病房] paternity leave /pəˈtɜ:rnɪti li:v/ [陪产假]
> 1) so maternity is basically just related to being a mother.or your pregnancy,or being pregnant.you have a maternity section,which is the clothing section for women who are pregnant.

> 2)maternity leave it could be a very short leave. It could be a very long leave. But the point is at the end of the day, it's still leaving and the boss takes that into consideration when he or she is hiring people. especially if you might take two maternity leave.maternity leave is not the easiest thing to say, So we do often just say "mat leave".

> 3)and we also have paternity leave,if we have like one year,then maybe the mother can take six months and the father can take six months.because you want the baby to be with its mother,but you know the father here is also very important.

# 3.ingrained /ɪnˈgreɪnd/ [adj.根深蒂固的] & ingrained bias
> 1)So ingrained it kind of means that you grew up with this idea, and this idea is kind of a part of you now. the grain here refers to "wood", that something is in the wood like that you can't get it out. It's an essential part of it.Remember just because something is ingrained, it doesn't mean it can't be removed. It's just very difficult.

> 2)often we might have this ingrained bias that you know other countries or are like worse, or like other countries are more dangerous,because we mainly just like learn the perspective that we have in our own countries.even in our own country, we might have an ingrained idea that say one gender is better than another gender or one race is better than another race. it's just the way that you are raised, but it doesn't necessarily mean that that is true.

> 3)Now fortunately, with some education and information, a lot of ingrained ideas or biases can be changed and people can come around to new ideas.

# 4.coming around to the idea [phr.开始接受这个想法] & warm up to [phr.对...变得更有兴趣]
> 1)this phrase coming around to you, it is a lot like warming up. Because when you warm up to an idea, it's not like you're just suddenly saying like "Oh, people are equal?"it’s just slow process.

> 2) I think we don't really put anything else there besides idea.But what we can do is we can just say coming around, like I think he's coming around.I think he's coming around,or even coming around to it. if you've already talked about the idea and you know the idea from the context, then, absolutely.

# 5.shrinking workforce/ profits [adj.萎缩的] & shrink your waist/worries
> 1)shrinking means that it's getting smaller.so we would not say like a reducing workforce. We would not say a dropping workforce. We might say like the workforce numbers are dropping.

> 2)shrinking workforce is a collocation.shrinking is almost always negative.so for example, you might have shrinking profits never good.you don't want shrinking profits. Now I don't really have a lot of profits to begin with. So I'm more worried about my clothes.if you put them in the dryer, they come out way too small. they might shrink in the dryer.

> 3)Now one thing that is positive that you hear in a lot of advertisements is shrink your waist.

- China's got a shrinking workforce and an ageing population. this is a set of problems that is not unique to China, but definitely apparent in China. 

# 6.nurturing /ˈnɜ:rʧərɪŋ/ [照顾人的] & raise
> 1)So nurture you know kind of similar to nurse, it basically means to take care of someone to help this thing grow.But nurturing has a more emotional aspect, and it's kind of like giving your child love. Love and advice and all. All the things that parents need to do, that's more than just "here eat this".

> 2)raise is more general and often it refers to things like feeding your children, clothing them, these kind of processes. And a lot of ways that parents help their children become nurturing is actually to give them a pet.

# 7.company [n.陪伴] & two’s company,three’s crowd [ptcp.两人成伴，三人不欢] 
> 1) it's a really good phrase, for example, if you have someone over at your house and someone calls, you can say: "Oh, I can't talk now. I've got company."

> 2)There is one other phrase that I've always loved, which is two's company,three's a crowd.that just means that two people are great, but three people is too many people.

# 8.bring out [phr.使...展示/显示] 
> 1)this phrase bring out means kind of like make something that was hidden or not very apparent open or apparent.but the basic thing to remember here is that it just makes something appear or makes it more visible.maybe you think that someone is caring, but they don't really show it, so you want to bring out their caring side to show other people. also with the clothing we use a lot like this blue shirt really brings out your eyes, makes your eyes look more blue.

> 2)And food as well like the wine really brings out the flavor of the steak.

# 9.sibling /ˈsɪblɪŋ/ [兄弟姐妹] & step-sibling [继父/继母的孩子]
>  a sibling is a brother or sister, could be older, could be younger. Doesn't even really need to be related by blood, I know this could be like a step sibling, adopted just a brother or sister any age.

# 10.vouch for sb/sth /vaʊʧ/ [phr.保证] & I can confirm that...
> 1)vouch just means that you can confirm this.when you were vouching for something,you're kind of responsible for saying that thing was good, and you might have to pay the price if it's not.you’re confirming that it is true.you can also vouch for a person.this often happens,if you recommended a friend for a position.And your boss wants to know can you vouch for him? Can you say that he is good? 

> 2) "I can confirm that"sounds a little formal.

# 11.holding you back [phr.束缚你] & juggling /ˈʤʌgəlɪŋ/ 尽量兼顾 
> 1)holding back just means what’s stopping him.we often think about kind of like these mental ideas that hold us back. I want to be a great opera singer,but the fear of failure hold people back.

> 2)juggling is an activity. I wouldn't say it's a sport but it's something that people do. It's when people throw those three balls into the air and you have to always keep one in the air.

# 13.It’s hard enough...let alone... [phr.更不用说] 
> So it just means that the first option is hard enough and the second option is even harder. 

- 1. it's hard enough for me to cook breakfast, let alone dinner.

- 2. It’s hard enough juggling work and one kid,let alone two kids.

# 14.surging /ˈsɜ:rʤɪŋ/ [adj.飙升的] 
> 1)so surge is normally a bad thing. For example, you have a power surge and then all your lights disappear.That's when there's just so much electricity like an overwhelming amount of electricity that our electronics just can't handle it.

> 2) it is good when you have a surging economy though, I suppose I mean it's like we said before, just because a word like shrinking or surging. I mean just because we generally use those in negative ways, does not mean that you can't use them in positive ways.

# 15. put it on ice [搁置] & mafia /ˈmɑː.fi.ə/ 黑手党 & pay the price 付出代价
> the basic meaning of put it on ice just means like postpone it or delay it.because you know long long ago, we did not have refrigerators, we did not have technology to keep things fresh. So you would actually need to put things on ice, just to keep them kind of like alive or going.when you remove it, you know, from the freezer when you take it off the ice, it does melt again.

# III.pattern
***Hey, Jayce. Now, that China has a two-child policy. Have you thought about having a second child?***

***Honestly, as an only child growing up, I’ve always had this ingrained idea that “one is enough." But, these days I’ve been coming around to the idea.***

***Oh yeah? What’s changed your mind?***

***A couple of things. For one, we’ve got a shrinking workforce and an aging population.***

***Fair, but I assume that’s not the main reason.***

***No, definitely not. My wife and I both think my son could use some company. Having a sibling might also bring out his nurturing side.***

***As the eldest of three siblings, I can vouch for that, so what’s holding you back?***

***Well, It’s hard enough juggling work and one kid, let alone two kids.***

***True. The surging cost of childcare and living would be an added pressure too.***

***Yup. My wife is also concerned that a second maternity leave might hurt her career.***

***Mmm...and if you can’t find affordable help, she may have to put it on ice indefinitely.***

***Exactly. But, as much as we’d love another bundle of joy, we aren’t in any rush. So, we’ll just wait until the time is right.***
