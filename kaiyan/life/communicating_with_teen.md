# I.3 psychologist-backed tips for improving communication with teenagers
> The key to building a positive relationship and sorting out any communication difficulties with your teenager is to keep the channels of communication open. Below are some tips for improving communication with teenagers. 

# 1.use open questions
> Using open questions is a vital tool in making communicating with teenagers easier. A closed question that you can answer with a yes or no stops communication rather than starts it. Instead, an open question can encourage them to say more and to share ideas and feelings. For example, you can say, "Tell me more."

# 2.use "I" statements to communicate 
> If there is an issue you're concerned about, it isn't always effective to broach it with a "you" message. Instead, using "I" statements can help you more clearly communicate how your teen's behavior is impacting you. For instance, "Your bedroom is a disgrace," becomes "I need you to pick up your things."

# 3.use more than dos than don'ts
> Often parents know what they don't want to happen, so they lead in with a "don't" statement. The downside of "don't" statements is that they fail to promote the positive behavior you want to see. If anything, they reinforce the behavior you don't want. You can swap your "don'ts" for "dos." For example, "Don't hit your brother," becomes "Play gently with your brother." 

# II.grammar
# 1.to nip sth in the bud
> It is an idiom that means to stop something at an early stage before it becomes unmanageable. Interestingly enough, this phrase actually originated as a gardening term. "To nip it in the bud" literally means to cut the buds of the flowers off before they are able to fully bloom. However, it's
frequently used metaphorically, to talk about halting problems before they grow bigger.

> Note that some native speakers may accidentally say "nip this in the butt." This is a common mistake that has arisen because of the similarity in pronunciation between "butt" and "bud."
