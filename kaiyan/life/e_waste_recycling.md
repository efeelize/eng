# I.what can we do about the growing e-waste problem
# 1.why the upsurge in e-waste
> Technology is integrated into our lives. Meanwhile, the life span of devices is getting shorter. As prices are dropping, electronic devices are in demand around the world.

# 2.what's in e-waste
> Electronic devices contain a complex mix of materials that include gold, silver, copper, and other elements. But they also comprise toxic heavy metals like lead, mercury and hazardous chemicals, which can harm human health and the environment.

# 3.the state of e-waste recycling
> Formal e-waste recycling usually involves disassembling the electronics, separating and categorizing the contents by material and cleaning them. At these informal recycling workshops, people recover valuable materials by burning devices to melt away non-valuable materials, using mercury and acids to recover gold, and dismantling devices by hand to reclaim other materials of value.

# 4.what can we do about e-waste
> The best thing you can do is to resist buying a new device until you really need it. Before recycling, seal up any broken parts so that hazardous chemicals don't leak. Recyclers with the E-Steward label on their websites have been certified to meet the cleanest and most responsible standards for e-waste recycling.

***Sam, I don't know what to do with my old phones.***

***Whatever you do, don't toss them. E-waste is extremely hazardous to the environment.***

***I've heard. Apparently, if it ends up in landfills, contaminants can seep into the soil.***

***Yep, and burning it just creates fine particulate matter in the air.***

***Crazy. Do you ever sell your used electronics to shops that salvage the parts?***

***Yeah, but I'm skeptical about how much they really benefit the environment. Often they just extract the precious metals, but other recyclable parts are thrown away.***

***Yikes!Tech companies should incentivize people to recycle more,like Apple's trade-in program.***

***True, but that's just a drop in the bucket. And with the expansion of electric vehicles, the e-waste problem will likely get worse.***

***Hmm... And planned obsolescence doesn't help either. Phones usually only last 2 years.***

***Right. I feel people would be more inclined to safely dispose of stuff if there were more recycling depots.***

***Yeah, and just educating people to reduce, reuse and recycle would help.***

***Personally, I'm in favor of a recycling deposit.***
