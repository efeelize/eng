# 1.knowing yourself

# 2.empathy
> Empathy is defined as the ability to truly know others, all the while understanding their feelings, being able to perceive their point of view, cultivating a sincere interest for their concerns and hence being able to sustain harmonious relationships with a wide range of personalities.

# 3.social skills
> It is usually quite easy to talk to and appreciate people with great social skills, which is a manifestation of emotional intelligence. People who have strong social skills are usually team players by nature. Rather than vying for their own success, they would rather help others develop and shine to their full potential. They know how to communicate efficiently and have great conflict resolution skills, all the while being adept at developing and maintaining healthy relationships with others.
