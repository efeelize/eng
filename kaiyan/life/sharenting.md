# 1.on the flip side
> Alice thinks sharenting is bad, so she mentions some of its negative aspects. Next, Jeff tries to defend sharenting, so he mentions some
positive aspects about it by saying, "on the flip side, it helps parents form bonds and swap parenting ideas."

> This is a common way to use the idiom "on the flip side." It helps us introduce a different or opposite aspect of something. It can be a positive or negative aspect. It’s similar to the expression "on the other hand." You
can think of the "flip side" as the "opposite/other side."

> For example, if someone wants to talk about the positive and negative aspects of a situation, like their job, they might say, "I have to work a lot of overtime and my office is far from my house, but on the flip side, I
like the work and the salary is great."

# III.grammar
***Babe, look! The video I posted of Jeremy dancing on his birthday got 200 likes!***

***Sweetie, our son is only two. Don't you think you're taking this sharenting thing too far?***

***What? No. It's how people document their kids' childhood in the digital age.***

***I know, but it just seems like everyone is vying for attention online with baby pics.***

***OK, but on the flip side, it helps parents form bonds and swap parenting ideas.***

***True, but at what cost? It all seems innocuous, but have you thought about the digital footprint Jeremy will inherit?***

***You think these posts will come back to haunt him and then he'll resent us?***

***Well, we are invading his privacy before he's even old enough to give consent.***

***Yeah, but it's not like we're commodifying him or posting anything too embarrassing.***

***I know. But down the road, everyone on social media may look at these posts. Who knows what they'll do with them?***

***Fine. I'll change the privacy settings.***

***Thanks, honey.***
