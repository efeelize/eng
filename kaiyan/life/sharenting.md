# Sharenting
# I.5 questions to ask before you post
# 1.why are you sharing it?
> this is probably the most important question to ask.you should have a good reason before you send content out into the world.

# 2.would you want sb to share it about you?
> this isn't always the perfect barometer,as you might be an extrovert who is happy to share and your child might grow up to be an introvert who is not.if your child is old enough to ask,ask them.

# 3.could your child be embarrassed by it,now or in the future?
> granted,it's part of the parental job to embarrasss our children.but it's one thing to show an embarrassing picture to their future partner,and it's another thing to send it out to the world.

# 4.Is there anyone in the universe who shouldn't see this about your child,now or at any point in the future?
> if what you are thinking of posting could come back to bite your child in any way ever,don't do it.

# 5.How does this part of digital footprint paint your child?
> you'd probably like your child to come across as smart,industrious,well-behaved,and kind,right? Does what you are posting help that-or hinder it?

# II.pattern 
# 1.on the flip side/on the other hand 
> This is a common way to use the idiom "on the flip side." It helps us introduce a different or opposite aspect of something. It can be a positive or negative aspect. It’s similar to the expression "on the other hand." You
can think of the "flip side" as the "opposite/other side."

> For example, if someone wants to talk about the positive and negative aspects of a situation, like their job, they might say, "I have to work a lot of overtime and my office is far from my house, but on the flip side, I
like the work and the salary is great."

***Babe, look! The video I posted of Jeremy dancing on his birthday got 200 likes!***

***Sweetie, our son is only two. Don't you think you're taking this sharenting thing too far?***

***What? No. It's how people document their kids' childhood in the digital age.***

***I know, but it just seems like everyone is vying for attention online with baby pics.***

***OK, but on the flip side, it helps parents form bonds and swap parenting ideas.***

***True, but at what cost? It all seems innocuous, but have you thought about the digital footprint Jeremy will inherit?***

***You think these posts will come back to haunt him and then he'll resent us?***

***Well, we are invading his privacy before he's even old enough to give consent.***

***Yeah, but it's not like we're commodifying him or posting anything too embarrassing.***

***I know. But down the road, everyone on social media may look at these posts. Who knows what they'll do with them?***

***Fine. I'll change the privacy settings.***

***Thanks, honey.***
