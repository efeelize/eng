# I.three tips to maintain a healthy work-life balance
# 1. Actually leave the office
> While working long hours is inevitable once in a while, be cautious about partaking in long work days on a regular basis. Long work hours can actually be dangerous for your health.

> If you find yourself consistently staying late to finish up work, try setting an alarm on your email or phone at a certain time each day. This will remind you that it's time to go home, forcing you to assess if the work you are doing can be finished up the following day.

# 2.Quit responding to non-emergency emails after business hours
> Responding to email after business hours can give people the impression that you're available to them whenever they need you. Suddenly, the other person has the power over you, causing you to essentially be tied to your mobile device at all times.

> To set email boundaries, try informing your coworkers and clients that they should contact you via phone call if there is a true work emergency that needs to be addressed immediately.

# 3.Participate in an activity after work
> Instead of watching TV after a long day at the office, try participating in some type of physical activity that will get you moving while allowing you to escape your work.

> Go for a run or bike ride, play a game of catch with your child, or walk your dog. Just do something.
