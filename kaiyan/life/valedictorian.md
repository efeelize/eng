# I.Celebrity Graduation Speeches
> Most graduation ceremonies in North American include many speeches. Most students only have the opportunity to watch a local politician, or maybe an old professor speak at their graduation, but if you are one of the lucky few who go to American's elite schools, then you might get to listen to a speech given by a celebrity. 

> Today's lesson is a collection of some of the best graduation speeches made by politicians, business leaders and celebrities to the class of 2016. Some of the voices you heard include Steven Spielberg and President Barack Obama. 

> Often, speeches are given by actors or comedians, and so naturally the subject matter is quite funny. Even Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling [搞笑] in her speech Harvard students in 2008 joked that "Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honor, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight." [还帮我因为演讲的恐惧减了几公斤体重]

> However, sometimes comedians take a more serious approach to the subject matter, like John Stewart did in his speech to William & Mary students in 2004: “College is something you complete. Life is something you experience. Don’t worry about your grade, or the results, or success. Success is defined in myriad ways [许多方式] and you will find it and people will no longer be grading you. It will come from your own internal sense of decency.[你内心的尊严] ”

> Many speeches focus on character building [性格建设]. Oprah Winfrey reminded Harvard students that “Even though this is the college where Facebook was born, my hope is that you will try to go out and have more face to face conversations with people you disagree with. That you’ll have the courage to look them in the eye and hear their point of view and help make sure that the speed, and distance, and anonymity [匿名性] of our world doesn’t cause us to lose our ability to stand in someone else’s shoes and recognize all that we share as a people.”

> all the more poignant /'pɔɪnjənt/ [adj.深刻的] after the celebrity has passed on, and their death adds weight to their words [更有分量]. For example, in 2005 Steve Jobs, who just a year before had been diagnosed with cancer, gave an inspiring address to the graduating students of Stanford University. In his speech, he told the students that “Your time is limited,” he said, “so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma [信条]—which is living with the results of other people’s thinking [别人生活和思考的结果]. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice [别让别人的意见变成噪音干扰了自己内心的声音]. And, most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition [直觉]. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”

# II.commencement speeches
> It's the moment that all students wait for during their university degrees. They can finally be recognized for their accomplishment and celebrate the start of their careers. Universities usually have a notable guest speaker to perform the speech, and Ivy league universities are no exception. 

> Often, a university will have famous alumni [知名校友] to give commencement speeches when possible. Some of the most famous commencement speeches have come from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling at Harvard University in 2008, Apple's Steve Jobs at Stanford University in 2005, and President John F. Kennedy at American University in 1963.

# IV.grammar
***I know that many of you made miracles happen to get to this day.You've shown between challenging classes and Greek Life...You worked hard, studied late into the night.You’ve survived so much to get to this moment. However you got here, you made it.You have come to this moment of incredible achievement, receiving your degree.***

***But then again Jeannine and I have only been here for an hour. And we’re also getting one. It’s a great day, because today marks the end of one era of your life and the beginning of something new.What you choose to do next is what we call in the movies the "character defining moment".The stories you’re about to live are the ones you’ll be telling your children, grandchildren and therapists.***

***But seriously, I know that graduation speakers are supposed to inspire and offer good advice. But I’m gonna be honest.The world is full of bastards. You won’t always get everything you want.Life is like the Star Wars movies. Some of it is great. Some of it sucks. But you have no choice but to sit through all of it.***

***The moments that really matter are the moments when life tells you “no”. The days that challenge you to your very core. So don't lose hope. No matter how dark it gets.Just please be honest with yourself. Live your dreams, not the dreams of others. Go make it happen.***

***I believe in you. I can’t wait to see how it turns out. I wish you all a true Hollywood style happy ending.Congratulations, the class of 2016. Good luck!***

# V.pattern
***Now I'm an unlikely speaker today, not just because I dropped out, but because we're technically in the same generation. Today, I want to talk about purpose. But I'm not here to give you the standard commencement about finding your purpose.***

***We're millennials. We try to do that instinctively. Instead, I'm here to tell you that finding your purpose isn't enough. The challenge for our generation is to create a world where everyone has a sense of purpose.***

***I remember that night I launched Facebook from that little dorm in Kirkland House. I went to Noch's with my friend KX. And I remember telling him clearly that I was excited to help connect the Harvard community, but one day someone would connect the whole world.***

***The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us. We were just college kids. We didn't know anything about that. There were all these great big technology companies of all these resources, and I just assumed one of them would do it.***

***But this idea was so clear to us — that all people want to connect. So we just kept working on it day after day after day.And I know that a lot of you will have your own stories just like this. A change in the world that seems so clear, that you are sure someone else is going to do it. But they're not. You will.***

***Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world that needs purpose, and it's up to you to create it.***
