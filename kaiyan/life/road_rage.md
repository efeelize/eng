# I.tips fro avioding road rage
# 1.a relaxed mood
> Most road ragers are usually dealing with some sort of emotional crisis, so if you experience something bad or you are emotionally unstable, be extra careful when you get behind the wheel. Give yourself some time to defuse before getting behind the wheel.

# 2.be predictable
> Focus on your driving and always check your blind spots and use your signals when you change lanes so you don’t turn anyone else into a road rager. Checking all the views around your vehicle and being a considerate driver should help with preventing road rage.

> If it's rush hour or you find yourself in a traffic jam due to an accident, listen to music and just come to terms with the fact that you're going to run late. It's okay. No need to be inconsiderate to drivers around you by making impolite gestures at people trying to merge into your lane.

# 3.aviod mad motorists,if at all possible
> If you try to speed up to pass a road rager or prevent them from merging in your lane, it only makes things worse and can put your life in danger! Let them pass and leave plenty of room between you and that grump.

# III.pattern
***What's the matter Jim? You look perturbed.***

***I just had a bit of an incident on the road. Some guy cut me off and I just flew off the handle.***

***But you're such a chill guy! I didn't think you'd be prone to road rage.***

***I know, but this other guy was weaving across the lanes and I guess I just overreacted.***

***That's not surprising. With road rage, you're basically driving under the influence of impaired emotions.***

***But is there something about cars themselves that causes road rage, or is it something innate in us?***

***Well territoriality is innate. We feel ownership of the road, and when that is threatened it can trigger an intense response.***

***So are we forever doomed to take a back seat to our lizard brains?***

***No, there are lots of choices we can make to prevent getting road rage, like focusing on our own driving.***

***I guess I could have left earlier too. I might not have reacted the same way if I weren't already running late.***

***Little things can go a long way!***
