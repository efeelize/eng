# 1.Commitment
> When you’re in a relationship, it’s common for one person to feel more invested [付出更多]. Although it doesn’t always cause problems, issues may arise when topics like marriage or moving in together [同居] are brought up [出现].

# 2.Chores
> Being in a relationship is all about balance, and that includes balance in the home. When one person takes on “the lion’s share," [大部分家务] fights commonly occur. Although women typically bear the brunt of these tasks, men have also reported feeling underappreciated for their efforts. 

# 3.Social Media
> Addiction to [沉迷] social media platforms can also spark problems between couples. Often this occurs when one partner posts about the couple’s lives excessively online [整日沉迷网络], or keeps in contact with an ex.

# 4.Finances
> Money is always a sticky topic and couples often find themselves in blame [相互埋怨] games over spending. Usually, the saver ends up [最终] blaming the person who spends more, and the bigger spender begins to think that the saver is cheap [小气].

# 5.Work-life balance
> Having a poor work-life balance can put strain on [带来压力] the relationship. As a result, people who are in relationships with workaholics, or individuals who prioritize work [优先处理工作] over their partners, have reported feelings of betrayal.

# 3.you share [phr.你的那部分] & do one's share 
> 1) when you're doing your share, you're kind of doing your half of the work.we have to share the responsibility here. Now of course, in that case, "share" is a verb. you can use it for different situations, for example, if we're eating and someone says, "Hey, do you want the other pizza or something?" I can say, "No, no, no. I've had my share." It's all yours.you're making me think about songs, like "I've had my share of regrets, my share of headache, my share of joy."

> 2)But "do one's share", it's a noun.

> 3)Now of course there is one other way that this gets used a lot and that is when we are paying taxes.I mean we're just saying tax returns. All done now, though.It's always the same argument that comes up again and again, are people paying their, their fair share of taxes.That's right because there are a lot of people that are trying to evade them.

# 4.blush off [phr.拒绝听，不理睬，敷衍] & get a lot on my plate [phr.忙不过来]
> So "brush it off" means kind of like ignore.So you can kind of think about like a piece of dust on your shoulder and you just kind of like brush it off your shoulder.But we can use this in a lot of situations, for example, maybe you could brush off an embarrassment, And that situation you' re kind of forgetting about it and you treat it as nothing.It just didn't happen, you can also brush off your responsibilities. if what they're saying is important, then you probably shouldn't brush it off.

- 1. She told him about her concerns, but he brushed them off. [但他对此置之不理] 

- 2. Some people are better at brushing off embarrassment than others. [有些人比其他人更善于摆脱尴尬]

- 3. Being brushed off is never a pleasant feeling, especially when it’s by a significant other.[被人置之不理从来都不是一种愉快的感觉，尤其是当被一个重要的人忽略的时候]

# 5.cut me some slack & ease up on sb [放我一马吧] 
> 1)cut me some slack, basically means give me a break. so "slack", you can kind of think of something that's like loose. For example, you hear this word a lot, like as if you hear that someone has been slacking off at work, So they haven't really been working hard.

> 2)So if he wants her to ease up on him, it means that he wants her to go easy on him.just don't be so mean.

# 6.rhetorical /rɪ'tɔrɪkl/ question [n.反问句]
> So rhetorical question here is basically a question that doesn't need a response. This person is just kind of talking to themselves or maybe they are talking to that person, but they just don't want them to answer.It's functioning as a statement. Even using a question to, to say something.

# 7.pick a fight [phr.挑起战争] & start a fight 
> so fight can be verbal,so with words or physical.so this is a little bit different than start a fight, because if you start a fight, it kind of just happens, maybe you throw the first punch. But if you are picking a fight with someone, then you're looking for this fight, you want it to happen.

# 8.considerate [adj.体贴的]
> Because when you're considerate, you're thoughtful, you're thinking about others. it's one thing to say that you are considerate or even to be considerate, it's quite another thing entirely to actually do your share around the house.

# 9.look & look,I know...but...
> 1)so "look" as a really common expression that we use to say, And it really again the tone here is really important, because you don't want to say, you know, like look, look.That's really gentle.it really needs to be forceful and stressing.and short.when I use this one, it really is because somebody didn't understand what I was saying or maybe they tried to put words into my mouth that was not my meaning, you know. So I will have to say it again, "Look, I am not saying that", you know, blah blah blah, "all I'm saying is..." Blah blah blah.

> 2)but when you say "look", you're kind of showing that the person that you're kind of listening and understanding, you're just trying to get your point across. like I know you're busy, I know you're tired, I know… It's kinds of like you want to make that not a bit longer.

# 10.it's only right 
> it means that this is just fair,this is just proper.but we can use this in a fight to be, maybe persuasive.It's only right, that you know, if I'm working very very very hard, that I should come home and rest.

# 11.split the chores /tʃor/
> 1)"chores" :Just stuff you do around the house.So, it's like the cooking, the cleaning. Basically, this like just housework.It is housework,  my grandfather was a farmer, so chores for him were at the born, you know, like it would be, milk the cow, feed the pigs, scare the chickens, cut the grass.So it's like different for everyone.Just depends on where you live.

> 2)"split":It is very very very similar to share or divide.so splitting the chores means to divide the chores.So you've probably heard this like a lot, with splitting the bill.split the work, split the credit.

# 12.Does that sound fair & Is that fair to you?
> 1)"Fair". So you can just say it by itself.Just to say like is, what I'm saying fair, is it equal to you?

> 2)if you are in a couple already, you probably know, sort of develop your own language and of course you also want to save time. So you know, you wouldn't say like, "Does that sound fair, is that fair to you?"It sounds like you're talking to your boss or coworkers, something like that.Maybe even like a kid.You're trying to reason with them.OK, you can have the ice cream, but first, you have to do your homework, does that sound fair?
