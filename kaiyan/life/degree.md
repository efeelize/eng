# PHD_MAB
# I.most valuable PHDs.
> For PhD students, their degree represents both a tremendous amount of work as well as a potentially high future salary. However, at the end of the day, not every PhD will guarantee the same income or stability down the road. When it comes to the earning potential of various subjects, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) always reigns supreme [代表卓越]. In fact, computer engineering is one of the highest-paying PhD out there: workers with a PhD in electrical and computer engineering enjoy six-figure salaries after gaining 10 years of experience. Three of the next highest-earning majors (computer engineering, chemical engineering and biomedical engineering), also pay in the six-figure range. If science or tech isn't your cup of tea, a PhD in economics will open its own fair share of doors.

> Of course, not everyone pursues PhDs for financial reward. Adam had a lot of fun in today's lesson teasing Humanities students, because their subjects consistently rank at the bottom of these kinds of lists, both for early career salary and mid-career salary. Now with that said, many of these students are keenly aware that they are doing their degree for the love of the subject, and not the love of money. Money isn't everything, and knowledge can be a powerful motivator.

# II.make the MBA degree a wise investment
> Though it’s true that the investment on an MBA degree from the best business schools can seem like a huge expense, the outlook is fairly appealing[前景非常诱人]. It affords unmatched [无与伦比的] networking opportunities, confers invaluable credibility that can unlock professional doors, and boosts [提高] lifetime earning power [终身赚钱的能力] for most graduates. Getting an MBA might be one of the smartest career decisions you ever make.

> However, the choice of business school is perhaps more crucial. Lisa Bevill, IE’s director of admissions, notes the advantages of studying at a top-ranked business school: A key part of your learning will come from your classmates. High-quality alumni network [校友网络] has a huge impact on your future career; top ranked schools will also be audited [认可] by rankings and are more likely to be recognized by world leading accreditation bodies.

> Whether the school is the right "fit" is equally important. Liz Wagoner, assistant director of admissions at Boston University's School of Management, says: "Students should look at their career goals and which program is the best to help them achieve those goals. We encourage candidates to consider the resources and the network that they’ll have access to."

***Alright Tyler, why don't you tell me a little about yourself? Why do you want to do a PhD?***

***Well, Professor Bell, my time as an undergraduate opened my eyes to the wider benefit of science. Also, I had the chance to do some original research for my Masters, which has inspired me to take up the challenge of a PhD.***

***Before you start your PhD, are there any training needs you can identify?***

***I'm really interested in communicating my research to a wider audience, but I'm not that great of a public speaker.***

***I understand the department offers relevant training here, which I feel would be a big help to me, both academically and more generally.***

***What would you like the impact of this project to be?***

***Well as I just mentioned, I'd be excited to share my passion for this subject with a wider audience.***

***Apart from social media, I'd also like to contact some local schools and museums to discuss putting on some educational events.***

***What do you plan to do after you complete your PhD?***

***I feel my PhD project can open up new lines of inquiry for this field, and want to use it as the foundation for a fruitful research career. But I'm also interested in the wider development opportunities that the program has to offer.***

***I want to be an academic, but I'm happy to keep other options open.***

# V.pattern
***Hey, Jared. Do you have a sec? I need some advice on doing an MBA.***

***Honestly, it's a personal decision. Have you weighed the pros and cons?***

***About a million times. I just really want some more credibility to move up the corporate ladder.***

***That's huge, yes. An MBA will also equip you with the know-how and analytical skills you need on the front lines.***

***Yes. I'm also hoping to expand my professional network.***

***Absolutely. It's just that it comes at a huge cost.***

***Yeah. For starters, I don't know if I can juggle an MBA and a full-time job.***

***It's indeed very demanding. That's why many people quit their jobs and focus on their MBA full time.***

***But I'm not sure if I can afford to do that. Quitting my job and paying tuition at the same time.***

***I think if you can get into a prestigious school, it's definitely a solid choice career-wise. Your ROI will be high.***

***Good point. These days, MBAs are a dime a dozen, so it's worth spending the extra pennies for a school that sticks out.***
