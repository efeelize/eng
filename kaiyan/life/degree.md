***Alright Tyler, why don't you tell me a little about yourself? Why do you want to do a PhD?***

***Well, Professor Bell, my time as an undergraduate opened my eyes to the wider benefit of science. Also, I had the chance to do some original research for my Masters, which has inspired me to take up the challenge of a PhD.***

***Before you start your PhD, are there any training needs you can identify?***

***I'm really interested in communicating my research to a wider audience, but I'm not that great of a public speaker.***

***I understand the department offers relevant training here, which I feel would be a big help to me, both academically and more generally.***

***What would you like the impact of this project to be?***

***Well as I just mentioned, I'd be excited to share my passion for this subject with a wider audience.***

***Apart from social media, I'd also like to contact some local schools and museums to discuss putting on some educational events.***

***What do you plan to do after you complete your PhD?***

***I feel my PhD project can open up new lines of inquiry for this field, and want to use it as the foundation for a fruitful research career. But I'm also interested in the wider development opportunities that the program has to offer.***

***I want to be an academic, but I'm happy to keep other options open.***

***Hey, Jared. Do you have a sec? I need some advice on doing an MBA.***

***Honestly, it's a personal decision. Have you weighed the pros and cons?***

***About a million times. I just really want some more credibility to move up the corporate ladder.***

***That's huge, yes. An MBA will also equip you with the know-how and analytical skills you need on the front lines.***

***Yes. I'm also hoping to expand my professional network.***

***Absolutely. It's just that it comes at a huge cost.***

***Yeah. For starters, I don't know if I can juggle an MBA and a full-time job.***

***It's indeed very demanding. That's why many people quit their jobs and focus on their MBA full time.***

***But I'm not sure if I can afford to do that. Quitting my job and paying tuition at the same time.***

***I think if you can get into a prestigious school, it's definitely a solid choice career-wise. Your ROI will be high.***

***Good point. These days, MBAs are a dime a dozen, so it's worth spending the extra pennies for a school that sticks out.***
