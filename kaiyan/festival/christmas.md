# I.Christmas Eve
> Christmas Eve, also known as the Vigil /'vɪdʒɪl/ of Christmas [圣诞节守夜], is perceived /pɚ'siv/ [vt.察觉] as the culmination /'kʌlmə'neʃən/ [n.顶点] of the Advent season [降临节]. Christmas Eve is the day before Christmas Day and is associated with celebrating Jesus Christ's birth, although his actual birth date has been disputed among many scholars.[许多学者都质疑]

> However, many Christmas traditions that are around today have their roots [源于] in pre-Christian [基督教前] winter festivals [冬季节日]. These include the importance of candles and decorations made from evergreen bushes and trees [常青灌木和常青树], symbolizing everlasting /ˌɛvɚ'læstɪŋ/ [永恒] light and life.

> In Roman times, a mid-winter festival [中冬节] was held. This was a relaxing time with a lot of parties [聚会不停] and merry-making [欢乐不断]. It was also common to give other people small gifts, such as dolls for children and candles for adults. This festival culminated /'kʌlmɪnet/ with the celebration of the winter solstice /'sɑlstəs/ [n.冬至], which fell on December 25 in the Roman calendar [罗马历法].

> Christmas Eve is a public holiday [法定假日] in countries such as the Czech Republic [n.捷克共和国] and Estonia /ɛˈstoniə/ [n.爱沙尼亚]. Some banks and businesses are closed in some countries, including Austria and Germany, on Christmas Eve.

> In some countries, Christmas Eve is celebrated with large family meals featuring traditional Christmas dishes [圣诞节美味佳肴]. Many homes have their Christmas trees lit up [点亮], mistletoes /'mɪslto/ [n.槲(hu)寄生] hung, and other Christmas decorations, such as holly /'hɑli/ [冬青] and ivy /'aɪvi/ [常春藤], at this time of the year.

# II.grammar
# 1.being
> 1)An appended clause [附加成分] is extra information we add to a sentence.We can use an appended clause with "being" when the verb in the clause and the verb in the main sentence have the same subject.[从句中的动词主语和主句中的动词主语相同]

- Being a student, he gets a discount

> 2)We use appended clauses with "being" to shorten what we are saying.Without an appended clause [当从句中的动词主语和主句中的动词主语相同时], we'd have to add "Since he" to our example:

- Being a student, he gets a discount.

> 3)We use appended clauses with "being" to shorten what we are saying.[附加成分来缩短我们说的话].Without an appended clause [不使用附加成分], we'd have to add "Since he" to our example:

- Since he is a student, he gets a discount.

> 4)So instead of saying "because you are," we can say, "being + noun" or "being + adjective."

- Being Canadian, I love the outdoors.

- Being sick, he couldn't come to work.

- Being tall, sometimes it's uncomfortable riding the train. I'm like really squished in there.

- Being kind of like a disorganized person around Christmas time, I often do my Christmas shopping a little too late.

- 1. Being the first to leave work, I avoid all the traffic.

- 2. Being a new employee, she needs to ask a lot of people for help.

- 3. Being from different countries, we have a hard time communicating.

# 2.so far [phr.到目前为止]
> 1)it's not about distance,it's about time.so "so far" means until now, so "how's your day been so far" means from the morning until now.We use this a lot when people are in the middle of something, like in the middle of their day, or in the middle of their meal. "How's your meal been so far?"Or if someone has just recently started a new job, you can say, "How's work been so far?"

> 2)People can say "So far so good." That just means "I'm not having any problems."

# 3.unwrapped gifts & emptying stockings 
> 1)When you unwrap a gift, you open the gift by taking off the wrapping paper. So you wrap a gift, and you give it to someone and they unwrap it.I know for me there's always like one gift I don't unwrap because I usually regift it, so I give it to someone else and just leave it wrapped.

> 2)Unwrapping gifts is always the best part of Christmas. We do it really, really early in the morning. Besides like boxed presents, we also have stockings.Stockings are these big red socks that we hang over the fireplace, we put little gifts in them.They're usually little toys, or chocolate, or maybe gloves.

# 4.Christmas carols /'kærəl/ [n.圣诞颂歌]
> so here they're singing some Christmas carols around the fire. Now you could also have said Christmas songs.But when we use this word "carols" or "carol," we're talking about special songs that we sing at Christmas time.If you're walking around the city during Christmas time, you'll hear carols everywhere almost like too much. I think they're kind of overplayed this time of the year.Super overplayed. So you're going to a mall, you'll hear it on the radio. You'll hear it in your home. You'll hear it everywhere. There'll be carols everywhere.

> 2)Here it's a noun, but you could also say "go caroling." And when you go caroling, you, I guess... walk around the city and you sing songs.

# 5.go to a church service [n.做礼拜]
> 1)Perhaps if you are Christian, you might go to a church service. Now we're not talking about room service here, or customer service. It's a church service.A church service is when you go to the church, you listen to the priest talk. Maybe you light some candles and you read some stories about the birth of Jesus Christ, because that's kind of what Christmas is all about.

> 2)this service is like an event,we say hold an event,hold a chruch service,same thing.we also have funeral /ˈfjunərəl/ services when someone dies, or a memorial service to remember them.

# 6.feast [n.& v.大餐、盛宴]
> 1)when we described it as a nouns,It's more than just a big meal. We usually have these feasts around special times like a Christmas feast or a wedding feast.when you have a feast, it usually means that the food is really good.And maybe you have like lots of different types of food.

> 2)so you could feast on desserts, but just a note here, the verb is more formal, so you'll often see it in writing, but not that often in speaking.

# 7.extended family [n.大家庭] & immediate family [n.直系家庭]
> 1)your extended family, this is your, like your aunts, your uncles, your cousins, your cousin's cousins.

> 2)so your immediate family. This is like your parents, your children, your spouse /spaʊs/.

# 8.a national/public/statutory /ˈstætʃətɔːri/ holiday [n.国家法定假日]
> it's that time of year we're all counting down to. It's when the whole country has a day off.That's a holiday for everyone. We can also call it a public holiday.Or a statutory holiday.but that's much harder to say. Some examples of national holidays include New Year's Day or Labor Day.

# 9.I guess...
> it's not actually guessing,it's about stating a fact or showing something that you noticed.you know this and you just want to talk about it.Say you just missed the bus, you could say, "Oh, I guess we missed the bus."Or like "I guess it's raining," I'm outside. I can see the rain.
