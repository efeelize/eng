# I.Can white be worn after Labor Day?
> In the late 19th century, the society ladies were engaged in an invisible battle with the nouveau riche /ˌnuvo ˈriʃ/ [n.〈法〉暴发户], one that could only be won by the subtle manipulation of fashion.

> The "you can't wear white after Labor Day" rule was created to separate the old money elitists  /e'litɪst/ [n.优秀人才,杰出者] from the new money group. "It [was] insiders trying to keep other people out," according to Valerie Steele, director of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology, in an interview with Time, "and outsiders trying to climb in by proving they know the rules."

> For those who had money and could leave the city during warmer months, white was considered vacation attire /əˈtaɪr/ [n.度假服装]. "If you look at any photograph of any city in America in the 1930s, you'll see people in dark clothes," Charlie Scheips, author of American Fashion, has said.

> The true reason could be much simpler: After Labor Day became a federal holiday in 1894, it came to mark the end of summer. Vacationers packed away their breezy [轻盈的] white dresses in favor of darker-hued [深色的] clothing. "There used to be a much clearer sense of re-entry,[回归感]" explained Steele. "You're back in the city, back at school, back doing whatever you're doing in the fall - and so you have a new wardrobe."

# II.How do Americans celebrate Labor Day?
> Labor Day is one of the 10 federal holidays celebrated in the U.S. It takes place on the first Monday of September and marks the achievement and success of workers around the world. Typical festivities include parades with shows and speeches on workers rights and communities. 

> However, as time passes, ideas of Labor day continue to change and many now see the holiday as a weekend for picnics and barbecues. Since it also marks the end of summer vacation, many families view it as a final opportunity to go on a summer trip. As a result, most Americans may not celebrate the holiday with rallies and speeches, but it gives the workers much needed rest and a chance to reconnect with their family members.

# III.Labor Day and International Workers' Day
> Many countries celebrate Labor Day on May 1st because May 1st is International Workers' Day. The United States celebrates in September. So why don't Americans celebrate with the rest of the world?

> On May 1st, 1886, workers in Chicago went on strike for an 8-hour work day [8小时工作]. The strike quickly became violent and many strikers [抗议者] and police were killed. Three years later the International Socialist Conference [国际社会主义者代表大会] declared that in memory of the strike, May 1 would be an international holiday for labor, International Workers' Day. 

> In the following years, many American leaders knew that they had to have a day to celebrate labor, but they thought that if they chose May 1st, that would be giving too much power to the workers. Fortunately, another little country called Canada had been celebrating their Labour Day (with a u) in September for many years already, so America decided to do the same. Yet another thing borrowed from Canada by the Americans.

> 2)Now freedom as an adjective is basically just be free or not be free. this can be free like a bird is free to go anywhere. But it can also mean like available,  Are you free this weekend? "Woo, you know, I got a lot of open language comments to respond to."

***I usually just have a cookout at home, but a lot of people like to hit the beach, go camping or even hit the back-to-school sales before hanging up their white pants for the season.***

***Yeah, for some reason it's long been a fashion no-no to wear white pants after Labor Day.***

***Really? That sounds silly, Fred.***

***Tell me about it. So besides traveling, what else do you guys do on Labor Day?***

***That depends, places like my hometown have a big tug of war competition every year.***

***That sounds like a ton of fun!***
