> Halloween has become a billion-dollar industry [价值数十亿美元] in the United States. Americans are estimated to spend $9 billion [90亿] on Halloween-related items and activities in 2018, down from $9.1 billion [91亿美元] in 2017, according to the National Retail Federation's annual survey.

> While more than 175 million [1.75亿] Americans are expected to partake /pɑr'tek/ [vi.参与;分享] in Halloween festivities, the population that spends the most on the celebration is not evenly distributed throughout the country [在全国各地分布不均]. States in the South and Northeast are estimated to spend the most on costumes, candy, decorations, and greeting cards [贺卡上] combined than states in the Midwest and West. For example, those living in the South are estimated to spend, on average, $90.35 per person on these items in 2018. This is much greater than the average estimated expenditure on Halloween items in the Midwest [中西部] of $78.91.

> According to the NRF [美国零售联合], Americans who celebrate Halloween intend to spend an average of $86.79 each in 2018 ($3.2 billion [32亿] will be spent on costumes, $2.7 billion [27亿] on decorations, $2.6 billion [26亿] on candy, and $400 million [4亿美元] on greeting cards).

# II.grammar
# 1.I don't blame  someone
> 1)This expression "I don't blame people" and it kind of means like "it's not really their fault."It's like you understand why they do it.It's understandable like for example, if a company has to fire a bunch of employees because they don't have a choice, you could say "Well it's too bad that they fired them but I don't blame the bosses, because they had to do it."

> 2) Or there could be like a couple and they seem really good together, but maybe they broke up and you're like, "Well I don't really blame her like the guy was kind of crazy."it's understandable. You can even use it for yourself. You could say "I don't blame myself for doing that, maybe I had to do it."Maybe you just didn't know better at the time.

- 1. “But I don't blame people for wanting to have fun. [但我能理解人们想找点乐子的心情]

- 2. It's too bad that they fired him, but I don't blame the bosses [但我理解老板]. They had to do it.

- 3. I don't blame myself for doing that.[我不怪自己那样做]

- 4. I don't blame you for wanting to move somewhere warmer.[我能理解你想搬到更暖和的地方的心情]

# 2. preoccupied /ˌpriːˈɑːkjəpaɪd/ [全神贯注的；心事重重的]
> 1)"occupied" is another way to say that something is taken are reserved.So a washroom can be occupied, or maybe a meeting room is occupied, so you can't use it right now.

> 2)preoccupied" could be like when you're not listening to somebody, if I'm reading the news but someone's talking to me, I could say "Oh sorry, I was preoccupied with the news." so it's kind of like being distracted. You're not ignoring them but your brain is busy somewhere else. So we have people being too preoccupied to make things themselves, but they bring up another point here, why they think Halloween has become a consumerist holiday.

- 1. He seemed a bit preoccupied.

- 2. I was too preoccupied with work to pay my taxes.

- 3. She's been really preoccupied recently because her dad is sick.

# 3.cut down on [phr.削减] & raked (it) in [轻易赚（很多钱)] & splurge /splɝːdʒ/ [挥霍、花大笔钱]
> 1)There's no actual cutting. Maybe you cut up your credit cards but you're not actually cutting something down like a tree. if you eat too much fat or too much sugar, and you know you're not healthy, you might say, "I need to cut down on fat or I need to cut down on sugar."it doesn't have to be food like, it could be something that you're just doing too much of. 

> 2) So we use "rake in" when companies make a lot of money in a short time, like Alibaba on Singles' Day, or movies. When movies come out, they make a lot of money in a short time.And we can say "rake in $9 billion" or "raked $9 billion in." But if we want to use "it," we have to say "raked it in." We can't say "raked in it."

- 1. She works in finance, so she rakes in over $200,000 a year [一年赚20多万美元].

- 2. Apple is really raking it in with their new iPhone.[苹果公司凭借新推出的iPhone大赚了一笔]

- 3. A lot of computer programmers really rake in the money.[许多计算机程序员确实赚的很多]

> 3)It means spend a lot, usually at one time. I find when people get their paycheck, like your company just paid you and you want to go out shopping and you might splurge on something new like, a new pair of shoes. Or if you have really excessive amounts of money, you might splurge on a new car.

- 1. Allen just turned 50, so he splurged on a new Corvette.[Allen刚满50岁，所以他挥霍了一笔钱买了辆新科尔维特跑车]

- 2. Parents have no problem splurging on their kids' education.[父母无疑会大力投资孩子的教育]

You want it now. You don't want to wait till later, so you just go out and buy it. 

> 2) consumerism are people that spend excessive amounts of money on clothes or shoes or even food.

> 3)”Commercialized" is talking about big business making money. it's all about making cash this time of year for these these large companies, these big businesses.So "commercialized" can be used for other situations or holidays, especially like Christmas.

# 5.scrambling /ˈskræmblɪŋ/ [仓促地做某事]
> So "scrambling" is rushing, rushing around to do something like, in this case buying something.We do it a lot around holidays like particularly Christmas time. We have to scramble around to buy presents. So typically when we're scrambling we don't have a lot of time.

# 6.thrift/secondhand  store [旧货商店、二手商店] & thrifty /'θrɪfti/ [adj.节约的] & retailers /ˈriːteɪlɚz/ [零售商] & supplier [n.供应商]
> 1)when we're talking about a thrift store, we're talking about a second-hand store.People give their old clothes or old toys or things to a second-hand store then other people can buy it, usually old vintage things clothes and we call it a thrift store or a second-hand store.I feel like thrift stores donate their money more. They kind of make money and then they donate it to people that are homeless or that kind of thing.

>2) if you're thrifty, meaning if you like to save money, you can go to a thrift store.

> 3)Retailer is just a store or a business that sells directly to the customer. and you have "large retailers," "small retailers," "online retailers."A supplier sells to the retailer, then the retailer sells to the customer.

# 7.trending towards/away [远离] & a growing/common trend [日益增长的趋势]
> 1)if something is "trending away," it means it's getting maybe less popular, or less like that thing ,that basically means it's moving away from what it started as.

> 2)"trend" in "trending" that means getting popular.

> 3)These days in North America, for example, people's diets are trending away from meat and more to vegetarian diets.

# 8.excessive /ɪkˈsesɪv/ [adj.过度的] & excessively [adv] & excess /ˈekses/ [n.无节制 & adj.额外的]
> 1)So if something's become "excessive," it's become too much.

> 2) this could be an adverb as well like someone maybe "talks excessively." That's "talks too much."

> 3) if something's "excess," it's just more than you need. It's not necessarily negative. It just means you ended up with more than you anticipated.So an excess of money isn't bad. That's good. It's more than you need.

# 9.origins & roots [起源] 
> 2)roots:We often use this word when talking about, for example, a company like Apple. Apple got its roots in a garage.And they started off making computers, but now there's a growing trend where they make more cell phones, iPods, or watches.Or it could just be the place that you're from. I have my roots in my hometown.
