# I.the origin of the term "calligraphy"
> Calligraphy is the art of beautiful handwriting. The term may derive from the Greek words for “beauty” (kallos) and “to write” (graphein). It implies a sure knowledge of the correct form of letters along with the skill to make and properly order the various parts and proportions harmoniously.[将正确的字母书写形式和书写技巧结合起来，可以使各个部分顺序合适、比例和谐] However, calligraphic work, as art, need not be legible in the usual sense of the word.

> In the Middle East and East Asia, calligraphy by long and exacting tradition is considered a major art, equal to sculpture or painting. In Western culture, the plainer Greek-derived [希腊语字母] and Latin-derived alphabets [拉丁语字母] and the spread of literacy have tended to make handwriting in principle an art that anyone can practice.

> Nonetheless, after the introduction of printing [印刷术] in Europe in the mid-15th century, a clear distinction arose between handwriting and more elaborate forms of scripts and lettering /'lɛtərɪŋ/ [更为精细漂亮的文本字迹]. In fact, new words meaning “calligraphy” entered most European languages around the end of the 16th century, and in English the word calligraphy did not appear until 1613. Writing books from the 16th century to the present day have continued to distinguish between ordinary handwriting and the more decorative calligraphy.[将普通的手写和更有美学装饰性的书法艺术区分开来]

# II.10 Spring Festival rituals and customs in and outside of Mainland China.
# 1.the family reunion dinner. 
> Just thinking about all the delicious homemade delicacies that are eaten on New Year's Eve is making my mouth water, especially the fish!

# 2.hongbao
> Red envelopes, or "hongbao", takes the number 2 spot today. I mean, really, no Chinese New Year would be complete without the exchange of these little cash filled guys.

# 3.eating nian gao, dumplings and mandarin oranges.
>  If you're from the north, it's likely that you're munching on dumplings. If you're from the south, it's likely to be nian gao. And as for the oranges, well, they seem to be enjoyed by almost everyone.

# 4.firecrackers and fireworks.
> Made from strings of rolled red paper containing gunpowder, firecrackers are super loud and believed by some to scare away evil spirits.

> However, they're not super safe to play with and thus have been banned in many cities for safety reasons. In addition to firecrackers, many cities put on astounding fireworks displays. Honestly, I have yet to see a better fireworks display than that of one during Chinese New Year.

# 5.lion and dragon dances
> I loved seeing today's number 5 custom as a child at Chinese New Year parades in the US, and that custom is lion and dragon dances. Said to bring good luck, these colorful dances are often performed as part of a street parade and involve a troupe of acrobatic dancers. Super exciting!

# 6.decorating
> You know it's Chinese New Year time when streets, storefronts and homes are all decorated in red in some fashion or another. I just love seeing all of the red lanterns, posters and auspicious phrases everywhere!

# 7.Praying at the temple
> Worshippers typically visit temples on the third day of Chinese New Year to light incense and pray to the deities for blessings and good luck.

# 8.shopping
> Similar to festive markets, shopping takes the number 8 spot on today's list. Every year retail sales surge thanks to CNY.

# 9.house cleaning.
> I actually never knew this was a Spring Festival custom, but I've heard that families give their homes a thorough cleaning in the days leading up to New Year's Day.It's said that in preparation for the new year, people sweep away the bad luck of the past year and avoid dusting on New Year's Day, for fear that good fortune will be swept away.

# 10.festive markets.
>  With Chinese New Year around the corner, you'll find both indoor and open-air markets selling decorations, red envelopes, toys and all types of other things that are totally CNY.

> In places like Hong Kong and Macau, you'll even find tons of flowers at such markets as it is a New Year's tradition to give flowers in those areas.

# III.grammar
# 1.yet
> 1)As an adverb, its meaning is similar to "still" or "even", and of course is often used in phrases like "I haven't finished yet".

> 2)  as a word that links two adjectives with opposite meanings [连接两个意思相反的形容词]. We see it in the phrase "graceful yet chaotic". You wouldn't want to use "and" here, because "graceful" and "chaotic" are two words that seem like they should not be connected. However, when you use "yet", you are showing that they can be.This structure is used a lot when giving opinions about art, but that is not its only use.
