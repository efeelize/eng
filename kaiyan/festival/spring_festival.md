# I.the origin of the term "calligraphy"
> Calligraphy is the art of beautiful handwriting. The term may derive from the Greek words for “beauty” (kallos) and “to write” (graphein). It implies a sure knowledge of the correct form of letters along with the skill to make and properly order the various parts and proportions harmoniously.[将正确的字母书写形式和书写技巧结合起来，可以使各个部分顺序合适、比例和谐] However, calligraphic work, as art, need not be legible in the usual sense of the word.

> In the Middle East and East Asia, calligraphy by long and exacting tradition is considered a major art, equal to sculpture or painting. In Western culture, the plainer Greek-derived [希腊语字母] and Latin-derived alphabets [拉丁语字母] and the spread of literacy have tended to make handwriting in principle an art that anyone can practice.

> Nonetheless, after the introduction of printing [印刷术] in Europe in the mid-15th century, a clear distinction arose between handwriting and more elaborate forms of scripts and lettering /'lɛtərɪŋ/ [更为精细漂亮的文本字迹]. In fact, new words meaning “calligraphy” entered most European languages around the end of the 16th century, and in English the word calligraphy did not appear until 1613. Writing books from the 16th century to the present day have continued to distinguish between ordinary handwriting and the more decorative calligraphy.[将普通的手写和更有美学装饰性的书法艺术区分开来]

# II.10 Spring Festival rituals and customs in and outside of Mainland China.
# 1.the family reunion dinner. 
> Just thinking about all the delicious homemade delicacies that are eaten on New Year's Eve is making my mouth water, especially the fish!

# 2.hongbao
> Red envelopes, or "hongbao", takes the number 2 spot today. I mean, really, no Chinese New Year would be complete without the exchange of these little cash filled guys.

# 3.eating nian gao, dumplings and mandarin oranges.
>  If you're from the north, it's likely that you're munching on dumplings. If you're from the south, it's likely to be nian gao. And as for the oranges, well, they seem to be enjoyed by almost everyone.

# 4.firecrackers and fireworks.
> Made from strings of rolled red paper containing gunpowder, firecrackers are super loud and believed by some to scare away evil spirits.

> However, they're not super safe to play with and thus have been banned in many cities for safety reasons. In addition to firecrackers, many cities put on astounding fireworks displays. Honestly, I have yet to see a better fireworks display than that of one during Chinese New Year.

# 5.lion and dragon dances
> I loved seeing today's number 5 custom as a child at Chinese New Year parades in the US, and that custom is lion and dragon dances. Said to bring good luck, these colorful dances are often performed as part of a street parade and involve a troupe of acrobatic dancers. Super exciting!

# 6.decorating
> You know it's Chinese New Year time when streets, storefronts and homes are all decorated in red in some fashion or another. I just love seeing all of the red lanterns, posters and auspicious phrases everywhere!

# 7.Praying at the temple
> Worshippers typically visit temples on the third day of Chinese New Year to light incense and pray to the deities for blessings and good luck.

# 8.shopping
> Similar to festive markets, shopping takes the number 8 spot on today's list. Every year retail sales surge thanks to CNY.

# 9.house cleaning.
> I actually never knew this was a Spring Festival custom, but I've heard that families give their homes a thorough cleaning in the days leading up to New Year's Day.It's said that in preparation for the new year, people sweep away the bad luck of the past year and avoid dusting on New Year's Day, for fear that good fortune will be swept away.

# 10.festive markets.
>  With Chinese New Year around the corner, you'll find both indoor and open-air markets selling decorations, red envelopes, toys and all types of other things that are totally CNY.

> In places like Hong Kong and Macau, you'll even find tons of flowers at such markets as it is a New Year's tradition to give flowers in those areas.

# III.Gifts on a budget 
> If you’re buying gifts for family members on a budget, or you have a big family, here are some ways from Time.com that can help you be more frugal /'fruɡl/ [adj.节俭的] during the holiday season.

# 1.Cut Out the Adults 
> Only exchange gifts for the kids. You can save more than $200 this way, and the adults will be happy that their kids are happy.

# 2.Rotate /'rotet/ [vt.使旋转] Recipients
> Rotate between the four siblings /'sibliŋz/  and their families[轮着给兄弟姐妹和他们的家庭买礼物]. It’s fair and it makes the gift-giving more meaningful.  

# 3.Agree to Get Crafty /'kræfti/ [adj. 灵巧的] {原创礼物}
> Do homemade gifts, like a photo album. Not only are they fun, the recipient will appreciate it even more.

# 4. Focus on Experiences
> Consider giving experience gifts—whether[可以考虑赠送体验性质的礼物] that means buying tickets for a ball game or making plans to take the kids to a matinee /ˌmætn'e/ [n.戏票]movie.

# 5. Pick One and Be Done [挑一个人送礼物]
> Rather than try to spend $50 on everyone in each family—which would total $500—pick one name to buy for[取而代之的是挑一个人赠送单价更高的礼物], with a set price range of $100 to $150 per person.

# IV.spring festival taboos
> With Spring Festival just around the corner, it's time to start planning all those fun activities. I'm sure that a lot of you have some family traditions, but you might also have a few Spring Festival taboos /tə'bu:z/. What are these? Well, they're things you're not supposed to do around this time of year!

# 1.cleaning or sweeping 
> First on our list is to avoid housework. Before the Spring Festival, there's a day of cleaning. This is to sweep away the bad luck. But during the actual celebration, it becomes taboo. Cleaning or throwing away garbage may wash away your wealth for the coming year.If you must sweep, start from the outside and sweep everything into the middle of the room. This symbolizes collecting wealth.

# 2.eating porridge
> Number two has to do with our first meal of the new year. Some people believe that eating porridge for breakfast will bring bad fortune. I myself love a bowl of porridge in the morning, no matter the occasion, so I don't follow this belief. But if you want to stick with tradition, cook up some dumplings instead.

# 3.breaking dishes
> Next up, it's believed that breaking things will break your connection with prosperity and fortune. If you happen to break something, wrap /ræp/ it in red paper while repeating auspicious /ɔ'spɪʃəs/ [adj.吉祥的] words or phrases. After the new year, throw the wrapped objects into a lake or river. This will reverse /rɪ'vɝs/ [v.反转]your misfortune.

# 4.giving the wrong gifts
> OK, last but not least, there's gift giving. Many people bring gifts when they pay a visit to family and friends. However, bringing the wrong gift can bring bad luck to both you and the recipient. With the red envelopes[n.红包], make sure you don't give an odd amount of lucky money. It's best to give even amounts, unless it contains the number four.Also,borrowing or lending money at this time is taboo.

> Well, there you have it. These rules may seem excessive /ɪkˈsɛsɪv/ [adj.过度的] during the Spring Festival. Especially when you add the other customs that come with this holiday. But like most things, it's better to be safe than sorry.

However, when you use "yet", you are showing that they can be.This structure is used a lot when giving opinions about art, but that is not its only use.

***Okay, and the last stop on our tour is the study.***

***Oh wow, this is incredible. Look at all the books! And what's all this stuff on the desk?***

***That's my calligraphy gear: ink, paper, brushes, and an inkstone. We call them the Four Treasures.***

***Amazing. It looks so graceful yet chaotic at the same time.***

***Balance and rhythm are essential in calligraphy. At its very heart, it's all about correct strokes, stroke order, and character structure.***

***I was pretty good at handwriting in school, but I'm not sure I could ever do this.***

***My son is taking lessons, maybe he can give you a few pointers on penmanship!***

***Do lots of kids study calligraphy?***

***In my day, we did. But I always read that it's on the wane with the younger generation, which is really a shame.***

***What do you mean?***

***Well, calligraphy requires a high level of concentration and patience, things which I think are invaluable to a person's refinement.***

***So, in a way it's a kind of aesthetic meditation?***

***That's it exactly!***

***Laura, you have had so many deliveries lately.***

***That's right, Mason. I'm going home for Chinese New Year this week, and I'm still doing some last-minute shopping for everyone.***

***Don't you give red envelopes instead of gifts on Chinese New Year?***

***Yes, but those are usually for the kids. I wouldn't give my adult relatives cash or even coupons for that matter.***

***Yeah, I guess that would be a bit awkward. So what do you get them then?***

***For my older relatives, I usually buy things like health supplements.***

***So you buy gifts for your extended family then, not just your immediate family members?***

***Both. I come from a very close-knit family. My parents are very close to their siblings. So am I to my cousins.***

***Do you all gather together for the New Year?***

***We sure do! And we also make a point of going to visit other relatives throughout the holiday. And when you go visit, it's not polite to go empty-handed.***

***But buying gifts for everyone does add a bit of pressure. Money aside, I'm just running out of ideas.***
