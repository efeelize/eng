# Independence Day
# I.The Faces [头像] of U.S. Banknotes
> The Founding Fathers [建国之父] of the United States are featured [印在] on many of the U.S. dollar bills, also called banknotes. 

> The most famous is, of course, George Washington, who was the first president of the United States and is prominently /ˈpr ɑmənəntlɪ/ [adv.显著地;] featured on the $1 dollar bill. 

> Thomas Jefferson, also a Founding Father [建国之父], is on the $2 dollar bill. Jefferson was the main author of the Declaration of Independence [独立宣言]. You may have never seen a $2 [从来没有见过两元纸币] note because they have limited circulation [流通受限制]. Next we have perhaps the most famous U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln, on the $5 note, although he was not a Founding Father. In fact, Lincoln wasn’t even born until 30 years after the Declaration of Independence. 

> The next three notes [面值], the $10, $20, and $50 [10美元，20美元和50美元], all feature presidents (Alexander Hamilton, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses Grant [尤利西斯·格兰特]), however none of them were Founding Fathers. Finally, the $100 bill features Benjamin Franklin, one of the most important Founding Fathers. Franklin was an author, politician, postmaster [邮政局局长], scientist, inventor, civic activist [公民活动家] and a diplomat [外交家]. A little known fact is that Franklin invented bifocal /'baɪ'fokl/  glasses [双焦镜].

*** I’ve always known that the Fourth of July is your national day. But I don’t even know what year the United States was founded.***

***It was 1776, when John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Thomas Jefferson drafted and signed the Declaration of Independence. Those three and a few others, like George Washington, are called the Founding Fathers.***

*** Interesting. America was still a part of Great Britain before that, right?***

***Yep. The U.S. was only composed of thirteen colonies governed by England. They wanted to be self- governing. So on that day, they declared themselves a new nation.***

***Was that the American Revolution?***

***Not exactly. The American Revolution was set in motion 10 years before that as many Americans grew increasingly intolerant of British rule.***

***Oh, I see. I’ve always liked the American flag. It looks very nice!***

***Yeah, we call it the Star-spangled Banner, and each star represents one of the 50 states. The original only had thirteen stars. Each time a state joined the union, they added a star.***
