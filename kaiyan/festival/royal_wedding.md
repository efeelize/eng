# I.The Role of the British Monarchy
> The British Monarchy /'mɑnɚki/ [英国君主制] is known as a constitutional /ˌkɑnstə'tuʃənl/  monarchy/'mɑnɚki/ [君主立宪制]. This means that, while The Sovereign /'sɑvrən/ [n.君主] is Head of State [国家元首], the ability to make and pass legislation [通过立法] resides /rɪ'zaɪd/ [vi. 居住] with an elected Parliament [民选议会]. Although The Sovereign no longer has a political or executive role [行政职务], he or she continues to play an important part in the life of the nation.

> As Head of State [国家元首], The Monarch undertakes constitutional and representational duties [代表职责] which have developed over one thousand years of history. In addition to these State duties [国家义务], The Monarch has a less formal role as 'Head of Nation'. The Sovereign acts as a focus for national identity [国家认同], unity [团结] and pride [自豪]; gives a sense of stability [彰显稳定] and continuity; officially recognizes success and excellence; and supports the ideal of voluntary service. In all these roles, The Sovereign is supported by members of their immediate family [直系亲属].

***Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are finally tying the knot. Marrying an actress is no surprise, but I never thought I’d see an American join the Royal Family.***

***I guess you could say this is just another form of globalization, Winston. I say, since Harry is known as the Prince of Wales, what will Meghan’s title be after they get married?***

***That’s a good question, Reginald. I heard that she will be regarded as a duchess and a princess.***

***Two titles at once? And what’s a duchess?***

***A duchess is the female equivalent of a duke, old boy.***

***According to European nobility, a duke is the highest rank below the monarch. For example, Harry’s father, Charles, Duke of Cornwall, is next in line to the British throne.***

***But he is also a prince; this is making my head spin. So, are all princes and princesses both dukes and duchesses?***

***No, since the Queen must first grant a royal dukedom, there are Windsors who have yet to receive this title.***

***Gosh, I never knew the aristocracy was so complex!***
