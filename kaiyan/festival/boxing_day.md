> You just kind of lay back, take it easy. What do you think about you know other people on Boxing Day, because actually these traditions here are some of the things that people now do on Boxing Day. People really do go swim the Channel. You can't go fox hunting anymore, but people do go shopping at the sales. I mean some of the stuff is here so you watch the football. If you don't go to the game, then watch on TV. go to the sales, if you've spent your Christmas with your parents and married, Boxing Day you would go to the in-laws.If you spend the Christmas with your in-laws, then Boxing Day you'll go to your parents.it's a pretty relaxed day for most people.So it's basically just an extra day, you know on the Christmas holiday to allow you to relax and just kind of take it easy.

# III.pattern
***Hey Gavin, do you have any Boxing Day plans?***

***No special plans: probably just eating some leftovers and drinking a few with my mates. You?***

***Well, since the old fox hunting tradition has been banned, I thought I'd pick up a new tradition and give swimming the Channel a try.***

***I'm serious! I thought it'd be fun, plus it would excuse me from having to go to the bloody sales with the missus after lunch.***

***I think I'd rather relax, eat some ham and mince pies, and go shopping with my lady than take a dip in the Channel this time of year.***

***If I had it my way, I'd just watch the match, but the wifey usually has other plans for me.***

***Bollocks, my wife just sent a message saying she wants me to visit the in-laws on Boxing Day. Suddenly, swimming the Channel doesn't sound too bad!***
