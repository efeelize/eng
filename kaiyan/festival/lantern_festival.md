# Lantern festival traditions
# I.Culture: Lantern Festivals in North America
> Lantern Festivals have been held in large North American cities like New York and San Francisco for decades. However, with an increase in the Chinese migrant population, and in an effort to boost tourism, many more cities all across North America have begun to take part in the festivities in recent years. From more well-known cities like Las Vegas and Montreal to lesser visited locations like Tulsa, Oklahoma and Cary, North Carolina, Chinese lanterns of all shapes and sizes are illuminating the dark night sky. Contradictory to actual Chinese tradition, many of these festivals are not actually held on the 15th day of the first lunar month. In fact many of them seem to coincide a bit more with the Western holiday season. For example, Vancouver’s most recent Chinese Lantern Festival was held from December 15, 2017 to January 21, 2018, ceasing far before the actual holiday.

> Chinese food was the first Asian cuisine /kwɪˈzin/ [n.菜肴] to land in the New World. Beginning to attract a fast-growing non-Chinese clientele /'klaɪən'tɛl/ [顾客,客户] of diverse ethnic /'ɛθnɪk/ [adj.种族的] backgrounds in major cities across the nation around the end of the 19th century, Chinese food was the first ethnic cuisine [最先登陆新大陆的亚洲菜肴] to be highly commodified  /kəˈmɑdəˌfaɪ/ [vt. 使商品化]as a type of food primarily to be prepared and consumed away from home at a national level. As such, it injected /ɪn'dʒɛkt/ [vt.注射,注入] a refreshing air of diversity to a country long dominated by an Anglo culinary /'kʌlɪnɛri/ [adj. 厨房的,烹饪的] monotony, which remained evident as late as the 1960s. John Steinbeck recalled [回忆] that “in the eating places along the roads the food has been clean, tasteless, colorless, and of a complete sameness [不好吃也不好看]”after taking a cross-country road trip in 1960. By 1980 Chinese had become the most popular ethnic cuisine in the United States as a result of changes in Chinese immigration.

> Moreover, Chinese food has also been a vital lifeline [重要命脉] for Chinese Americans, existing as one of the two main sources of employment for them for decades. Its development, therefore, is an important chapter [重要篇章] in American history and a central part of the Chinese American experience.But for example all over America and North America, in small cities that people haven't even really heard of, I haven't heard of, are starting to have these big Lantern Festival.

> The UK, we have Lantern Festivals every year in mainly the big cities, obviously, London. Liverpool, really big Chinese population. And I think that's an old, a really old Chinatown there. They have that, Manchester, Birmingham. All the big cities. All have big Lantern Festival.

> Not as far as I remember growing up. There might be one now. There are a lot of Chinese students flowing into the city. We had a new university has been there for the last ten or fifteen years. it might be, by the time I go home there might be a Lantern Festival in Lincoln. I mean the world is becoming more, you know, it's becoming a smaller place. You know, here in China you see Christmas decorations in December and now in America Lantern Festivals in February. 

# II.grammar
# 1.around the corner
> 1)to express that a location is not far away, or that one location is in close proximity to another. so like on the street, down the street, maybe. But here, she doesn't mean like a festival is happening down the street.

> 2)the phrase is to express that an event is imminent /'ɪmɪnənt/ [adj.迫近的] , or is likely to happen very soon.she means basically the holiday is, well, it's coming up, it's going to be very soon, it's coming up soon, 

- 1. Starbucks isn't far from here, it's just around the corner. 

- 2. St. Patrick's Day is just around the corner, do you have any green clothes to wear? 

- 3. He is so devoted to his company and believes that a promotion is right around the corner.

# 2.to make A out of B
> The phrase "to make A out of B" means to take an object and transform it into something else. The first noun (A) always the new product, and the second noun (B) is the original object or material. It's commonly used in discussions about cooking and crafts.

- 1. We made lanterns out of paper for the festival. 

- 2. In the summer, the kids like to make castles out of sand.  

- 3. We made happy faces out of the cookie dough.

# 3.handmade [手工制作的] & from scratch [phr.从零开始，从无到有做一件事情] & store-bought /stɔr-bɑt/ [成品，商店买的]
> 1)handmade,made by hand, they might have bought the materials but they put it together with their hands. Nowadays, you can find handmake, what, one thing that is nice is like a card. Christmas cards, birthday cards.Instead of buying it, put a bit more effort in, make something.or if you go to a store, you know, someone might say, this is handmade clothing. This is handmade jewelry. This is handmade pottery. So anything that is made by hand can be called handmade pretty much.

>2)So if you make something from scratch, that means that you don't buy anything. Nothing is pre-made, you make it all from the beginning yourself. for example,my grandmother used to bake cakes from scratch. She would take the flour and the eggs and the butter and the, the sugar, everything. Put it all together and make it from scratch.

> 3) if you don't make your own dumplings and you have them pre-made at a store, they are store bought. straight forward.the opposite nowadays a lot of people you might buy cake mix which is not from scratch.you just put it in a bowl and you kind of mix it together, and you get yourself cake. So maybe that cake mix is store bought.

# 4.got such a kick out of that[从中得到无比乐趣]  
> Get a kick out of something. If you get a kick out of it. It means that you enjoy it.like I really got a kick out of video games.

# 5.true story [phr.说的有道理]
> basically you're right. You're right. 

# 6. long gone [早已消失] & the good old days[美好旧时光] 
> 1)long gone,we use it a lot,and it just means,gone for a long time.we haven’t seen it for a long time.so if you're thinking about how, when you were young and you were in school and maybe all your school friends and what you used to do. You could say those days are long gone. So usually long gone we used to, basically it's usually used to describe something that is not happening anymore, I had to hang up my guitar, my rock and roll days are long gone.also like athletes. Sportsmen or athletes can say, oh my playing days, my playing days are long gone.so if you're like a retired football player, you can say oh, you know, my football days are long gone, right? Really you can use this for anything. My days as an attorney are long gone, right? My days as a doctor are long gone.

> 2) the good old days just means, you know, when you were young, it was a time where you were really happy and you enjoyed life, you enjoyed things.good old days, the days that are now long gone. You, you, at the time you remember them as, being, maybe the best times of your life or certainly the time you really enjoy.We're living in the new times which in the future maybe good old days, but we don't know yet.I think this is something that actually you often hear parents or old people say when they're referring to their childhood. How things used to be better. I think that was a simpler time or all those kind of ideas.

# 7.riddles /ˈrɪdəlz/ 谜语 & rabbit-shaped lanterns /ˈlæntərnz/ 兔子灯

# 8.recall & reminisce /ˌrɛməˈnɪs/ [回忆、召回] & nostalgic /nɔˈstælʤɪk/ [adj.怀旧的、怀念的] & nostalgia [n.]
> 1)Recall basically means to like remember,it's pretty much the same meaning. but recalled actually, I feel like it has some more uses than remember. And there's also another meaning that just means to recall, to like take something back at the same time.

> 2) So another meaning might be if a company has a product, that maybe, turns out it's dangerous. They need to recall that product. so they can fix it and then they can put it back on the market. For example, Samsung, their phones started to blow-up. And I think they had to recall the phones maybe, for a little bit.

> 3)Nostalgic is an adjective, I get nostalgic for the general one, the old cartoons. I used to watch when I was a kid. A lot of those old cartoons that you just, it's very difficult to find them now. but you do remember that feeling like Sunday morning sitting in front of the TV, watching these cartoons. Some of them I don't even remember the name of them. If you get nostalgic, it means you kind of like, you become happy when you think about the memories. But you're also kind of sad that, you know, you can't do it anymore in real life, That it doesn't happen anymore. 

> 4)nostalgia is a noun, So you can get nostalgic about old memories or you can feel nostalgia when you think about old memories. 

# 9. old fogey /fogey/ [老派的人、守旧的人] & geezer /ˈʤizər/ & old fart [老头，老家伙] & old bag/bat [老女人]
> 1)And old fogey is a term for an old man usually. But maybe not so respectful. it's usually old fogey, old fogey. He's probably like this unhappy, you know, kind of stupid old man maybe. he's out of touch. He doesn't understand the modern world.he doesn't understand today, today's world. You kids today in your video games, well, back in the old days, you know.We used to play with the metal hoop, stick.......
> 2)Another word for an old man, a bad term, these are bad terms, You can call someone an old fart or a geezer,these are bad words. You do not want to call your grandpa a geezer. it's pretty rude,it’s not like some of swear words. If you say this to someone, it's rude. But if you just say in conversation it's not offensive.

>3)we call old women like an old bag. In England you might hear old bag. In America you would hear old bat.It's kind of mild. I think it's not the worst thing you could say.

# 10.the essence of sth [n.精华]
>  the essence of something is like at the heart of it. It's the most important thing, the reason why something exists. So the reason why you do something.so it's kind of like the meaning or the spirit. Or like the basic quality of something.

# 11.since & because
> 1)since will be the word, you would use at the beginning of the sentence Since is a lot like the word because, but it's used a bit differently grammatically. it's related to time. Basically it's since something is this or a certain way, then it's something else like this as well.

- 1. Diana, since you don't eat beef, do you not eat chicken as well?

- 2. since it is raining today, do you think it will rain tomorrow?

> 2)because is going to be the conjunction you use in the middle of a sentence. I remember having English teachers when I was young saying "do not put because at the beginning of a sentence. Don't do that." And it might be related to time, but not necessarily.

# III.ingredients [原料]
# 1.sweet dumplings & soup rice balls [汤圆] & savory tangyuan [咸味汤圆] & minced pork [猪肉糜] & ground beef [牛肉末]

# 2.filling /ˈfɪlɪŋ/ [馅料、内陷] & packed /pækt/ [塞满了]
> the filling is what goes inside the dumpling. so you fill the dumpling, you put it inside. There's all kinds of fillings. Depends on what you're eating. But just remember guys that too fill means to like put something else inside of something. For example, we said one cup of water. So if you have a cup of water, you first have to fill the cup with water.

# 3.sticky rice [糯米] & glutinous /ˈɡluːtənəs/ rice flour /ˈflaʊɚ/ [糯米粉] & fermented glutinous rice [醪糟] 
> 1)So there's a type of Chinese food, another one very popular called Zongzi. And that's glutinous rice dumplings, but we also just call them sticky rice.

> 2)first of all rice flour is what you use to make, let's see, buns, dumplings, and noodles.Glutinous means sticky,ou don't hear it too often in English actually. It means sticky.  But here we have glutinous rice flour. So it's kind of like sticky rice flour.it's different from wheat flour.

> 3)Unfilled tangyuan are served as part of a sweet dessert soup.[糖水中配以无馅料的小汤圆]

# 4. black sesame /ˈsɛsəmi/ [黑芝麻] & black sesame/red bean/chocolate/taro /ˈtɑro/ paste /peɪst/ [黑芝麻酱/红豆沙/巧克力馅/香芋馅] & fruit preserves [水果馅] & crushed peanuts [花生碎]
> So paste is very sticky, and it's made by, you know, cooking the red beans for a long time and just kind of mushing them together. So you can kind of like we say smash maybe. Before it might be a bunch of little beans, but then you kind of mush them together into one paste. And that's what you get in the dessert.

# 5.knead /niːd/ [揉] & dough /doʊ/ [面团] & wrap /ræp/ sth around sth  [包裹] & mixing bowl /mɪksɪŋ boʊl/ [混合碗]
> 1)You use dough to make dumplings. You use it to make bread.you use it to make pizza or cookies.This is what it looks like when you put water and flour together, and you haven't baked or cooked it yet.So dough is kind of the paste.It's kind of like a flour paste almost actually.a little thicker though. it's thicker. But we knead it by using our hands. We kind of press on it to make sure it's mixed together well kind of.you know you push down on it, and you roll it around like a ball.

> 2)they're going to make balls out of the dough and pastes. So they're going to do that by kind of kneading and rolling.But then they need to flatten the dough balls so they can wrap the dough around the balls of paste.

> 3)so when you wrap it, you just put something around something.so there's so many things you can wrap.Just the key thing here to remember is that you are moving this object around and covering it.so we usually say wrap something around something.

> 4)this mixing bowl is made for, well cooking. You don't eat out of a mixing bowl.it's really large,And you just put a lot of different ingredients in it, and you combine the ingredients together.

- 1. Make sure that the table surface is clean before you start kneading the dough.

- 2. Make sure to wrap the leaves tightly around the sticky rice.

# 6.simmer /ˈsɪmɚ/ [煮] & boil & float /floʊt/ [漂浮] & surface /ˈsɝfɪs/ [表面]
> 1)So when you simmer, you cook in hot water.but the temperature is a little bit lower than boiling.

> 2)so boiling is when the water is filled, it has a lot of big bubbles. But simmer is just a little cooler than that,so maybe a little bubbles.

> 3)So if they're floating, then they're are like kind of on top of the water. Many things can float. For example, boats.

> 4)this word surface is really a good word. It's used a lot. So surface, like you said top of water, but everything usually has a surface,Or like the surface of your skin on your body. 

# 7.measuring cup & cups [量杯]
> So when you are cooking from a recipe, they usually have the number of measuring cups you need to use.so we need two cups of glutinous rice flour and one cup of water.

***Hey Tom, the Lantern Festival is just around the corner. Are you as excited as I am?***

***What is there to be excited about? The Lantern Festival just isn't what it used to be.***

***What do you mean?***

***Things have changed in so many ways. I feel like the traditions and overall essence of the holiday are long gone.***

***I think you're exaggerating a bit. What sort of traditions have we really lost?***

***Well, back in my day, the lanterns we used were handmade by my parents, and my grandparents would make sweet dumplings from scratch. Nowadays, everything is just store-bought.***

***Ok, yeah, I see what you mean there. I recall how my parents made a rabbit-shaped lantern for me when I was a kid. I got such a kick out of that!***

***Exactly. It's such a shame that kids nowadays don't get the full experience. I'm so nostalgic for the good old days.***

***Tom, you sound like such an old fogey. Things aren't quite the way they used to be, but what is? Besides, the significance of the Lantern Festival is still here: people get together with their loved ones to celebrate the final day of the Chinese New Year festivities.***

***True story. So what are your plans for the holiday?***

# V.pattern
***Hey Alan, would you like to try some soup rice balls? I just got some delivered.***

***Soup rice balls? What are those?***

***They’re made of sticky rice. The filling is usually black sesame, red bean paste or pork.***

***Oh, I’d love to try some. Thank you!***

***In fact, today is the Lantern Festival. We eat these rice balls to celebrate it. It also marks the end of the Chinese New Year celebration.***

***Oh, I didn't realize the New Year lasted so long!***

***Yeah, the public holiday is just a week. But traditionally it’s 15 days.***

***No wonder the streets are still not as crowded as usual. I guess a lot of people are still home.***

***Exactly.***

***Since you call it the Lantern Festival, do you also buy a special lantern?***

*** Yes, lanterns are a big part of it. We've got lantern riddles. Kids also get special rabbit-shaped lanterns which they can carry or drag around.***

***Wow, that sounds so cool! I want one of those too!***

# V.pattern
***Ok let's make sure we have the ingredients to make our sweet dumplings.***

***Sure! We need 2 cups of glutinous rice flour and 1 cup of water.***

***For that we need red bean paste and black sesame paste, which we have right here.***

***Great. First let's put the flour in a mixing bowl, add the water and then mix well. After that, we'll need to knead the dough.***

***Got it, and then what?***

***Then make little balls out of the dough and pastes. After that we'll flatten the dough balls so we can wrap the dough around the balls of paste.***

***No problem. Then we just cook the balls, right?***

***Then we finally get to eat them, right? I can't wait!***
