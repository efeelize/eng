# I.The story between Santa Claus and Coca-Cola
> The Santa Claus we all know and love — that big, jolly man in the red suit with a white beard [白胡子] — didn't always look that way. In fact, prior to the 1930s, the image of Santa was in a state of flux /flʌks/ [n.连续的改变] , depicted as everything from a tall, thin man to an eerie /ˈɪri/ -looking elf [从一个瘦高个儿的男人到一个长相怪异的小精灵].

> At the beginning of the 1930s, as the burgeoning /'bə:dʒəniŋ/ [adj.迅速成长的;迅速发展的] Coca-Cola company was looking for ways to increase sales of their product during winter (then a slack time of year for the soft drink market), they turned to a talented commercial illustrator named Haddon Sundblom, who created a series of memorable drawings (inspired in large part by Clement Clark Moore's 1822 poem "A Visit from St. Nicholas"[n.圣尼古拉斯来访]) that associated the figure of a larger than life, red-and-white garbed Santa Claus with Coca-Cola and the slogan "The Pause That Refreshes.[养精蓄锐]"

> Since then, Coke's annual advertisements [年度广告] featuring [绘制] Sundblom-drawn Santas holding bottles of Coca-Cola, drinking Coca-Cola, receiving Coca-Cola as gifts, and enjoying Coca-Cola has become a perennial /pə'rɛnɪəl/ [adj.经常出现的] Christmastime feature, which in turn reinforces the red and jolly [红彤彤，喜气洋洋] image of Santa as we know it today.

# II.grammar
# 1.着重引号: so-called & "quote" & "quote unquote" 
> 1)It's most commonly used when the word is not used with the standard meaning, or when the speaker wants to cast doubt on the subject. Their function is similar to the phrase "so-called," so it can be used to criticize someone's opinion.

> 2)In spoken English, the speaker indicates the quotation marks by saying "quote" or "quote unquote" before the word.English speakers also often use body language to represent scare quotes using two fingers on each hand to make the shape of quotation marks. These are called "air quotes" and resemble a gesture of bunny ears.

- 1. A: Ben is sick today so he won't be coming in? B: He's "sick," is he? I doubt it

- 2. A: The service here is terrible! B: I know. I won't be coming to this "restaurant" again!

- 3. A: Your car is so old! B: This "old" car is worth more than your house!

# 2.perpetuate /pɚˈpetʃueɪt/ [vt.使持续；使长存] & Perpetual [adj. 永久的; 终身的] & propagate /ˈprɑːpəɡeɪtɪd/ [传播，散播（意见、谣言）]
> 1)Perpetuate. "Perpetual" means forever. That's kind of where this comes from.So you're kind of passing on this information or you're allowing something to continue."Perpetuate" just is continuing like kind of in a straight line. 
- 1. Making it easier to buy guns will only perpetuate the gun problem.

- 2. The movie perpetuates stereotypes of a minority.

- 3. A very important issue in society is the perpetuation of discrimination.

> 2)"Propagate" is really about spreading.Far and wide in all different directions.Basically means "spread bad stuff." usually bad stuff. Generally opinions, beliefs, lies.We should be clear, it doesn't necessarily mean bad stuff. It's just usually, propagating ignorance, propagating lies.

- 1. The propagation of hateful messages on social media should be addressed.

- 2. The virus propagated to millions of computers.

- 3. Light waves propagate close to a million times faster than sound waves.

# 4.credulity /krəˈduːləti/ [轻信；易受骗]  &  incredulity /ˌɪnkrə'djʊləti/ [n.怀疑] & tantamount  /ˈtæntəmaʊnt tuː/ to  [n.等同于]
> 1)Credulity we're looking at not necessarily the etymology but some etymological connections here. "Cred, cred," sounds a lot like "credit." like a credit card. People believe that you're gonna pay the money back. that's what this word is about. It's willing or wanting to believe something, even when it might not be true.

> 2) Now it does have an opposite, which is used just as much, and that's "incredulity."If there was some really shocking news that people didn't want to believe, you could say, "The news was met with incredulity."

> 3) so "tantamount" basically just means "equivalent to" or "the same."there is one principle that some people believe, which is "not saying anything is tantamount to admitting guilt." That's a principle that I do not agree with.Now there is one principle that some people believe, which is "not saying anything is tantamount to admitting guilt." That's a principle that I do not agree with.But it seems that way. "Why aren't you saying anything?"That's what people definitely believe.

- 1. Too many people mistakenly believe that saying nothing is tantamount to admitting guilt.

- 2. Waiting to hear back about my job interview results is tantamount to torture

- 3. Failing to close the deal was tantamount to a huge yearly loss for the company

# 5.what I don't do is [我不会做的事情是...] & it's the principle of the thing [这是原则性问题] & fair enough [phr.有道理]
> 1) he's using this to kind of contrast with what he just said, right? And to emphasize: "what I don't do..." "I do this thing. What I don't do is this other terrible thing."

> 2) It's the principle of the thing.this phrase we can think about it as a set phrase. And when people say this, it's generally because they disagree with it. They think it's a bad thing. The idea of it is wrong.So Maddie is giving evidence here that kids that believe in Santa Claus turned out alright, but he's saying like "It doesn't matter how they turn out. What I'm most concerned with is the principle. The principle here is lying. Lying to your kids is bad."

> 3)If ever someone says something that you maybe don't totally agree with, but you still want to move the conversation forward, here are two great words that will help you do just that.And Jason uses the word "think" here. He's not really saying you should think about this. He's just giving an example to kind of explain his point. So Maddie says, "Fair enough."

# 6.culturally-endorsed [adj.文化上认可的] & movie camera 
> 1)Culturally-endorsed, so it basically means socially accepted. so when you endorse something, it means you approve it like officially or publicly. 

> 2)So I think in the popular imagination, Coca Cola is really where the modern Santa Claus comes from.The red and white suit, with the big white beard.And of course, they were just drawing pictures of him and putting him in magazines, but then they invented this thing called "the movie camera."

# 7.enlightened [adj & v.启发，阐述]
> 1)"enlightened" kind of means to explain something or to give some information to somebody.Or even just, you think about turning lights on. Somebody is aware of something. 

> 2)Now one thing that we should mention is that I used "enlightened" as an adjective. "He's an enlightened thinker," "an enlightened person." But in the dialogue, it's a verb.

# 8.etymology /ˌetɪˈmɑːlədʒi/ [词源学] 
> It's just where do words come from.the origin of that word. For example, a simple word that you learn at the beginning of your studies in English, "library." That word came from the Latin word "liber," which means book.so you can always ask, "What's the etymology of this word?"so you can always ask, "What's the etymology of this word?"

# 9.personification /pɚˌsɑːnəfəˈkeɪʃən/ [化身；象征]
> So this is basically when you're giving a human quality to a thing.I think of Greek gods, like the god of love or anger, or something.And we see this a lot in movies when maybe the bad guy is the personification of evil and superman is the personification of pure virtue. 

# 10.industrial complex [商业综合体（掺杂社会、政治等因素）]
> now in economics when a business becomes sort of intertwined /ˌɪntɚ'twaɪn/ [vt.& vi.缠结在一起] with social and political things.You cannot have your society function without this deeply intertwined set of social relations that comes generally from having these factories and the products that the factories produce.

# 11.depictions /dɪˈpɪkʃənz/ [n.描述] 
>  so a "depiction," you see "pict" in it, It kind of sounds like "picture" right off the back. I guess we could think about it as sort of being like a representation.It's not the real thing. It's just shown, it's representing that thing. I think of like movies about real people. The actor is depicting or making a depiction of some famous person. And we all know Hollywood loves to entertain. 

# III.pattern
***Hey, Jason. Do you teach your kids about Santa Claus?***

***Yeah, as long as it's the truth. What I don't do is perpetuate a culturally-endorsed lie.***

***Oh, so you've enlightened them about how it originated in the 4th century?***

***Yeah, with St. Nicholas and how he gave gifts to children... hence the gift-giving.***

***Hmm, and so did you tell them the etymology of "Santa Claus"?***

***Sure did. The Dutch version of St. Nicholas. And also how Father Christmas was the British personification of Christmas.***

***That's a lot of history. Don't you think that takes the magic out of Christmas?***

***That "magic" came from the Christmas industrial complex. Think Christmas shopping.***

***Fair enough. There were a lot of marketing campaigns in the early 20th century, like with Coca Cola.***

***Yep, and all the Hollywood depictions have really propagated the modern Santa Claus***

***I still think kids who believe in Santa Claus turn out alright.***

***But it's the principle of the thing. It encourages credulity, and is tantamount to bribing kids for good behavior.***

***Do you know any other way to get kids to behave?***
