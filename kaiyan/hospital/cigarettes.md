# 1.The whole time… it turns out [一直... 结果发现]
> 1)It is a way to express that while originally it was assumed that one thing was the case, in reality it was not the case. It is made up of two phrases that you can use on their own, but putting them together really emphasizes that a situation has developed in a much different way than originally assumed.

> 2)In the “whole time” clause, we usually use the past tense. It’s often in the past progressive [是过去进行时], as seen our dialogue line “they were telling us.” If you want to use verbs like “think” or “assume,” then you can use the past simple.

> 3)In the “it turns out” clause, you can use the simple present [一般现在时] “it turns out” or the past tense.[过去时态]

- 1. The whole time I thought she was American, but it turns out she was British. 我一直以为她是美国人，结果发现她是英国人。

# III.pattern
***Look at all those kids vaping over there. When did this thing catch on?***

***It's been around for a while, but it's all the rage now.***  

***The whole time they were telling us that teen smoking was down, it turns out these kids were vaping instead of smoking!*** 

***I guess the same stigma that applies to cigarettes doesn't apply to e-cigarettes.***

***But are they thinking about the long-term health effects?***

***They're kids! They just want to look cool. They're not worried about getting hooked.***

***That reminds me, have you seen these ads targeting kids? It certainly makes the claim that this product is for adult smokers ring hollow.***

***Yeah, these companies like Juul want to have their cake and eat it too.*** 

***That might explain some of the backlash. Do you think there will be stronger regulations in the future?*** 

***Well, they've already banned flavored cartridges. But I'm not sure I favor an outright ban.***

***Why's that?***

***I guess I'm just worried that if they can't vape, these kids might look for their nicotine fixes in conventional cigarettes.***

***Well that would certainly be ironic, wouldn't it?***
