# E-cigarettes
# I.E-cigarettes and vaping 
> Vaping is a relatively new practice, having only become popular within the past decade. Because of its novelty, researchers have warned that there's a lot we still don't know about how the practice impacts the brain and body.

> Given their relatively recent introduction, there has been little time for a scientific body of evidence to develop on the health effects of e-cigarettes," the authors of a large recent report on the overall health effects of vaping wrote.

> Last spring, researchers examining the vapors in several popular e-cigarette brands found evidence that they contained some of the same toxic metals normally found in conventional cigarettes, such as lead [铅]. They also found evidence suggesting that at least some of those toxins were making their way through vapers' bodies. 

> Consistently inhaling high levels of toxic metals has been tied to health problems in the lungs, liver[肝脏] , immune system, heart, and brain, as well as some cancers, according to the US Department of Labor's Occupational Health and Safety Administration [美国劳工部职业安全卫生局].

> To help prevent young people from vaping, states including Michigan, New York, and Massachusetts have banned at least some e-cigarette products.

# II.grammar
# 1.The whole time… it turns out [一直... 结果发现]
> 1)It is a way to express that while originally it was assumed that one thing was the case, in reality it was not the case. It is made up of two phrases that you can use on their own, but putting them together really emphasizes that a situation has developed in a much different way than originally assumed.

> 2)In the “whole time” clause, we usually use the past tense. It’s often in the past progressive [是过去进行时], as seen our dialogue line “they were telling us.” If you want to use verbs like “think” or “assume,” then you can use the past simple.

> 3)In the “it turns out” clause, you can use the simple present [一般现在时] “it turns out” or the past tense.[过去时态]

# III.pattern
***Look at all those kids vaping over there. When did this thing catch on?***

***It's been around for a while, but it's all the rage now.***  

***The whole time they were telling us that teen smoking was down, it turns out these kids were vaping instead of smoking!*** 

***I guess the same stigma that applies to cigarettes doesn't apply to e-cigarettes.***

***But are they thinking about the long-term health effects?***

***They're kids! They just want to look cool. They're not worried about getting hooked.***

***That reminds me, have you seen these ads targeting kids? It certainly makes the claim that this product is for adult smokers ring hollow.***

***Yeah, these companies like Juul want to have their cake and eat it too.*** 

***That might explain some of the backlash. Do you think there will be stronger regulations in the future?*** 

***Well, they've already banned flavored cartridges. But I'm not sure I favor an outright ban.***

***Why's that?***

***I guess I'm just worried that if they can't vape, these kids might look for their nicotine fixes in conventional cigarettes.***

***Well that would certainly be ironic, wouldn't it?***
