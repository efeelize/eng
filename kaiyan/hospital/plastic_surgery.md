# I.The most popular plastic surgeries in the U.S.
> The decision to get plastic /'plæstɪk/ surgery is a personal one. But as a nation, the United States is showing an increased interest in plastic surgery.

> According to the annual plastic surgery statistics report[年度整形外科统计报告] by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)[美国整形外科医生协会（ASPS）], there were nearly 1.8 million cosmetic surgeries performed in the US in 2017. That number might sound like a lot, but it's nothing [这个数字就显得不值一提] when you factor in the 17.5 million minimally /'mɪnɪmli/ invasive /ɪn'vesɪv/ procedures[微创手术], like fillers /'filə/ [填充剂注射], chemical peels[化学换肤], Botox /'bəutɔks/ [肉毒杆菌素注射], and laser hair removal[激光脱毛].

> Overall, there was a two percent increase in the number of cosmetic surgery procedures since 2016. Tummy tucks /tʌk/ [腹部整形术], eyelid /'aɪ'lɪd/ surgery[眼睑整容术], breast augmentations /ˌɔgmɛn'teʃən/ [隆胸], liposuction /'lɪposʌkʃən/ [吸脂], and nose reshaping[鼻子整形术] are currently the most popular procedures.

# 1.Eyelid surgery
> Eyelid surgery, or blepharoplasty /ˈblɛfərəˌplæsti/ , has seen consistent popularity over the last 2 years, with 209,571 procedures performed in 2017.

# 2.Nose reshaping
> Although nose reshaping procedures are still one of the most popular plastic surgeries around, with 218,924 performed in 2017, they're down 2 percent from 2016.

# 3.Liposuction
> Liposuction, or lipo, saw a five percent increase from 2016, with 246,354 procedures performed in 2017.

# II.grammar
# 1.get/have some work done 
> “get some work done” was used to mean “get plastic surgery.” The structure “get/have something done” is used when you pay for a service that you do not do yourself. Beyond surgery, this can include cosmetic treatments and repairs. However, when the object is a body part, it is usually understood that the person is referring to a cosmetic treatment or surgery.

> “get/have something done”这一结构指你花钱让别人为你服务，不用你自己动手。这个表达不仅可以指整容手术，还可以描述医疗美容和维修等等。不过，如果描述的对象是身体的某个部分，人们通常会理解为，说话人指的就是要进行医疗美容或整形手术。

- I'm thinking about getting my nose done.My bridge[鼻梁] is a little low.

- The older she gets,the more she thinks about getting work done on her wrinkles.[除皱]

- It's been years since we painted the house.Maybe we should get it done.[请人再刷一下]

# 2.plastic [adj.可塑的] surgery  & plasticity /plæˈstɪsətɪ/ [n.可塑性] &  reconstructive & cosmetic surgery /kɑz'mɛtɪk/
> 1)the plastic here is kind of, from the idea that plastic means that something is flexible and can bend right? It can change.So fake is the opposite of natural. Sometimes we often say plastic too, like this person doesn't look real, they look like they are made from plastic.

> 2) reconstructive /ˌrikən'strʌktɪv/ ：so that means they're kind of rebuilding you right? So this happens after an accident like a car crash, and they need to maybe rebuild your face a little bit.Exactly, yeah. If there's a burn, burned victims have to get reconstructive plastic surgery

> 3)so cosmetics have to do with makeup and things that you add to your face. It's not really something for health, it's just to improve your appearance.So this is a type of surgery to change your appearance.this one we're talking about today, which is called cosmetic surgery.

# 3.going under the knife [phr.动手术] & nose job [n.鼻子整形]
> 1）it doesn't matter what kind of surgery it is. When you get surgery, we say you're going under the knife.

> 2)we use this expression something job, it's like when you do some kind of work like in this case, of course a nose job, but let's say if you decide to paint your house, that might be called...a paint job.Or at work, if you have to do some work really really fast, your boss might ask you, hey, can you do a rush job?We could also say like possibly, an eye job or a boob job, which is the area of your chest. But we do not use this for every single body part.you don't say like mouth job or something else like that. Yeah, an interesting thing here, Elis says Hannah got her eyes done.

# 4.saggy /'sæɡi/ [adj.皮肤松弛的] & chubby [adj,胖乎乎的] & facelift /'feslɪft/ [n.拉皮] & botox & liposuction /'lɪposʌkʃən/ & over-the-hill [phr.衰老] & breast implants [n.丰胸] & rolls [n.赘肉]
> 1)So saggy, it means that something is not tight.So in this case, your skin, your skin will be loose. I guess it's kind of drooping.

> 2)chubby means that you're a little bit fat, but it's cute.Like chubby little kids are really cute, babies are chubby.

> 3)facelift:(1)so this is often to stretch your skin tighter.Or sometimes, you know, some people want that kind of slanted /'slɑ:ntid/ eyes[上挑的眼睛].（2）so we also use this word facelift for other things like a house?Yeah, and you could even say it for like a brand, you want to give a brand a facelift.Yeah, because maybe they're not popular anymore right? So they need to change their brands, so people like them.

> 4)botox:it just firms [v.紧致] the skin, it makes it look tighter, so you don't have those wrinkles and lines.But sometimes, it can make their skin or their face or whatever look a little puffy /'pʌfi/ [adj.饱满].

> 5)so lipo means fat.and suction means suck out.so they're basically vacuuming your fat out.

> 6）So over-the-hill means your past, the best part of your life.And it's only going to go down from hill.

> 7)this is because of saggy boobs. Or not always you know. So breast, breast is that chest area right? And implants are basically things that you put inside, and in this case, to make them look bigger and rounder.And implant, yeah, anything like organ or just something you put in your body, like that you can get a tooth implant.Yeah, yeah, or you could even get a chin implant, if you're talking about cosmetic surgery.

> 8) rolls are the fat folds, and usually around your stomach.Yeah, if you sit down, you might see some rolls, like most people do. but we don't really want to say like fat folds or anything right? Like rolls, rolls sounds much better.

# 5.insecure [adj.不自信的]
> So insecure, the opposite, of course, is secure, which kind of means safe, like you know, I feel much more secure in a car, when I'm wearing a seat belt. But we also use it for people, if a person is insecure, it means they don't have any confidence. and they're usually worried about something, like maybe they worry about their kind of personality, maybe they worry about their appearance.

# 6.quest for the perfection [[phr.追求完美]]
> 1)now quest is a little bit of a formal old word, but we do use it in these chunks like a quest for perfection or quest for truth.Yes, or quest for like self-fulfillment?Yeah, like a lot of people from North America go to India on, like a spiritual quest.Yeah, you're searching for something, it's you're not just traveling without a goal, you have a specific goal, something you're looking for.

# 7.get to you [phr.影响你]
> when something gets to you, it finally starts to like affect you.Yeah, it starts to bother you.maybe you're at work right? And your boss is very controlling and you try to endure it, but eventually, it gets to you. But you know what, just make sure that you don't let it get to you.Yeah, especially criticism, you know, don't let that get to you, because everybody is great just the way they are.
