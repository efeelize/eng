# I.The most popular plastic surgeries in the U.S.
> The decision to get plastic /'plæstɪk/ surgery is a personal one. But as a nation, the United States is showing an increased interest in plastic surgery.

> According to the annual plastic surgery statistics report[年度整形外科统计报告] by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS)[美国整形外科医生协会（ASPS）], there were nearly 1.8 million cosmetic surgeries performed in the US in 2017. That number might sound like a lot, but it's nothing [这个数字就显得不值一提] when you factor in the 17.5 million minimally /'mɪnɪmli/ invasive /ɪn'vesɪv/ procedures[微创手术], like fillers /'filə/ [填充剂注射], chemical peels[化学换肤], Botox /'bəutɔks/ [肉毒杆菌素注射], and laser hair removal[激光脱毛].

> Overall, there was a two percent increase in the number of cosmetic surgery procedures since 2016. Tummy tucks /tʌk/ [腹部整形术], eyelid /'aɪ'lɪd/ surgery[眼睑整容术], breast augmentations /ˌɔgmɛn'teʃən/ [隆胸], liposuction /'lɪposʌkʃən/ [吸脂], and nose reshaping[鼻子整形术] are currently the most popular procedures.

# 1.Eyelid surgery
> Eyelid surgery, or blepharoplasty /ˈblɛfərəˌplæsti/ , has seen consistent popularity over the last 2 years, with 209,571 procedures performed in 2017.

# 2.Nose reshaping
> Although nose reshaping procedures are still one of the most popular plastic surgeries around, with 218,924 performed in 2017, they're down 2 percent from 2016.

# 3.Liposuction
> Liposuction, or lipo, saw a five percent increase from 2016, with 246,354 procedures performed in 2017.

# II.grammar
# 1.get/have some work done
> “get some work done” was used to mean “get plastic surgery.” The structure “get/have something done” is used when you pay for a service that you do not do yourself. Beyond surgery, this can include cosmetic treatments and repairs. However, when the object is a body part, it is usually understood that the person is referring to a cosmetic treatment or surgery.

> “get/have something done”这一结构指你花钱让别人为你服务，不用你自己动手。这个表达不仅可以指整容手术，还可以描述医疗美容和维修等等。不过，如果描述的对象是身体的某个部分，人们通常会理解为，说话人指的就是要进行医疗美容或整形手术。
