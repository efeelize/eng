# I.tips to help save your hair
# 1. Mediterranean diet [地中海饮食法]
> A 2018 study revealed that a diet containing raw vegetables and fresh herbs, like the Mediterranean diet, may reduce the risk of androgenic [adj.雄激素的] alopecia /ˌælə'piʃə/ [n.秃头症] or slow its onset [n.开始].

# 2.Protein
> Hair follicles /'fɑlɪkl/ [n.毛囊] are made mostly of protein called keratin /'kɛrətɪn/ [n.角蛋白]. One 2017 study of 100 people with hair loss noted several nutritional deficiencies /dɪ'fɪʃənsi/ [n.缺乏,不足] in participants, including amino /'æmɪno/ [adj.氨基的] acids that serve as the building blocks of protein.

# 3. Multivitamin [多种维生素]
> Scientists have determined that vitamins A, B, C, D, iron, selenium /sə'linɪəm/ [硒], and zinc /zɪŋk/ [n.〈化〉锌] are all important to the hair growth and retention processes, specifically with cell turnover [细胞的更新]. 

# 4. Gentle styling [不伤发的造型]
> Skip tight braids or ponytails that may pull on hair at the root and potentially lead to excessive shedding. While you're at it, let your hair air dry to avoid irritating your scalp.

# 5. Massage
> We know scalp massage feels good, but can it help grow your hair, too? Maybe. One small 2016 study showed participants seeing results with as little as four minutes of massage a day over the course of 24 weeks.

# 6. Yoga
> Hair loss caused by stress may respond well to yoga. Try stress-relieving yoga poses to prevent and slow hair loss.

> 2)This one is negative,it's kind of like if you have like a bad behavior and you do it for a long time, then eventually you're gonna face the consequences.It refers to the moment when a person experiences the negative consequences of an innate or biological problem or prolonged behavior.

## 3)hair restoration /restəˈreɪʃən/ [n.头发修复]

## 4)transplant /trænˈsplænt/ [n.移植]

# III.pattern
***Will, I feel like my hair has been getting thinner lately.***

***Looks fine to me. But many people do start experiencing hair loss at our age.***

***When I woke up this morning, I found a few strands of hair on my pillow.***

***That's nothing. The human scalp tends to lose 50 to 200 strands each day. Our hair is in a constant cycle of growth, rest and renewal.***

***I don't know. After all, my father is bald. Maybe my heredity is finally catching up to me.***

***Well, if you are going bald, genetics is just one potential factor. Constant stress and an improper diet can also trigger hair loss.***

***Maybe that's it. Or maybe I've gotten too much exposure to ultraviolet rays. Why did I go to the beach last summer!***

***OK, let's not freak out here, Brendan. There's still a lot you can do to keep a full head of hair. Maybe you could try a hair restoration product.***

***Laser therapy and hair transplant surgery are popular these days.***

***Yeah, you could go that route. Or, wait a minute, did you get a perm recently?***

***Yeah, so what?***

***I think we might have our answer.***
