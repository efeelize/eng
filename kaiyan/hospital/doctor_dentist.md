# I.Getting Health Assistance in North America
> In North American culture, people generally don't see the doctor unless it's something unusual or untreatable at home [无法进行自行医治]. Sickness like the flu are not enough to visit the doctor unless they get worse. In addition, a family doctor [家庭医生], or general practitioner (GP), is the first person to see before going to a specialist, like a skin doctor. The GP will take a look a look at the patient and recommend the next step to take. GPs have an excellent general medical knowledge, so there is no need to worry about your symptoms. If the GP thinks a patient needs emergency or additional medical care, she will refer the patient or send the patient immediately to a hospital. 

> Although this system of GP then specialist seems like a lot of work for the patient, it saves the specialist time and energy dealing with patients who do not need to be there, and has been an efficient system in North American.

# II.Dental insurance in America
> It is reported that approximately 205 million Americans, roughly 64% of the population, had dental insurance coverage at the end of 2014. Most people get their coverage from an employer or organizational group insurance plan. A smaller number buy individual insurance coverage. Three basic types of dental insurance plans exist:

# 1.Dental health maintenance organization
> DHMOs (dental health maintenance organizations) are structured plans with a set group of dentists who provide care for a low monthly premium. DHMOs are excellent for preventive services (checkups, cleaning and X-rays), which are typically covered at 100%.

# 2.Dental preferred provider organization
> DHMOs (dental health maintenance organizations) are structured plans with a set group of dentists who provide care for a low monthly premium. DHMOs are excellent for preventive services (checkups, cleaning and X-rays), which are typically covered at 100%.

# 3.Dental preferred provider organization
> DPPOs (dental preferred provider organizations) negotiate lower rates with dentists in their network, aka their "preferred providers". Most DPPOs are what is known as "100-80-50" plans: The plan covers 100% of preventative services, 80% of certain basic procedures and 50% for major services such as crowns.

# 4.Indemnity dental insurance
> A dental indemnity insurance plan allows you to visit any dentist. It pays a set amount based on a pre-calculated “usual, customary and reasonable” (UCR) fee. Very often, you must pay an additional amount out of pocket.

# III.grammar
# 1.get+宾语+过去分词
> When we use get + object (o) + past participle (-ed form), it means that we cause something to happen or to be done. It is slightly less formal than using have + object + past participle

- 1. I need to get my computer fixed because I don't know how to fix it. 

- 2. My coworker sometimes gets me irritated. 

- 3. He needs to get this work done as soon as possible so we can submit it.

# 2.as far as something goes [口语]/ concerned [书面] / “关于这个主题”或“关于”
> The expression "as far as something goes" means “regarding this topic” or "with regard to". It's a phrase that is common in casual speech. The similar expression “as far as something is concerned" is more appropriate for formal speech or writing.

- 1. He's been having a lot of trouble with English this year. But, as far as his math grades go, he's been doing great. 

- 2. As far as dental surgeries go, the most painful surgery that I've had has been a root canal [根管手术].

- 3. She has nothing to worry about as far as finances are concerned.

***Hey, Rachel. I think I have a throat infection. Where can I get some antibiotics?***

***Oh, have you been to a doctor here before?***

***No, so I’m anxious about it because I don’t know where I should go.***

***Well, many people have family doctors, but you don’t necessarily need one.***

***Oh, so can I go straight to a specialist?***

***No, you can just see a GP, or regular doctor, at a walk-in clinic.***

***Walk-in clinic? So I don’t need to make an appointment?***

***It’s better if you do, but you can just show up there. You just fill out your name, insurance and medical history, like allergies, then sit and wait for the next opening.***

***Then when can I see a specialist?***

***You might not need one. The doctor will take a look, and if you need more specialized care, he’ll give you a referral.***

***Oh, so then if I need medicine or drugs, do I pick them up at the doctor’s office?***

***No, the doctor will write you a prescription, but you have to get it filled at a pharmacy.***

***Oh, sounds like a lot of work.***

***Not really. There’s usually a pharmacy within a block of any doctor’s office.***

***Hey, Tyler. How are you doing today? Toothache still bothering you?***

***Yeah. I think I have a cavity. I have a lot of sensitivity in my left molar when I eat sweets.***

***Ok. Let's take a couple x-rays first and do an oral examination. After that, the dental hygienist will give you a cleaning and we'll go from there.***

***So, it looks like you have some tooth decay as well as some gum inflammation.***

***Does that mean I'll need a filling?***

***Not yet. If you floss properly and use a fluoride mouthwash you should be fine. But, you do have a crack so you may need a crown later.***

***Ok. I was also thinking about having my teeth whitened and straightened.***

***As far as cosmetic dentistry goes, I can whiten your teeth. But if you want braces, I'll refer you to an orthodontist.***
