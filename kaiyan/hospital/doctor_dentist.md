# I.Getting Health Assistance in North America
> In North American culture, people generally don't see the doctor unless it's something unusual or untreatable at home [无法进行自行医治]. Sickness like the flu are not enough to visit the doctor unless they get worse. In addition, a family doctor [家庭医生], or general practitioner (GP), is the first person to see before going to a specialist, like a skin doctor. The GP will take a look a look at the patient and recommend the next step to take. GPs have an excellent general medical knowledge, so there is no need to worry about your symptoms. If the GP thinks a patient needs emergency or additional medical care, she will refer the patient or send the patient immediately to a hospital. 

> Although this system of GP then specialist seems like a lot of work for the patient, it saves the specialist time and energy dealing with patients who do not need to be there, and has been an efficient system in North American.

# II.Dental insurance in America
> It is reported that approximately 205 million Americans, roughly 64% of the population, had dental insurance coverage at the end of 2014. Most people get their coverage from an employer or organizational group insurance plan [集体保险]. A smaller number buy individual insurance coverage. Three basic types of dental insurance plans exist:

# 1.Dental health maintenance organization [牙科健康维护机构]
> DHMOs (dental health maintenance organizations) are structured plans with a set group of dentists who provide care for a low monthly premium [较低的月保险费]. DHMOs are excellent for preventive services [口腔疾病预防服务](checkups, cleaning and X-rays), which are typically covered at 100%.

# 2.Dental preferred provider organization [牙科优选医疗机构]
> DPPOs (dental preferred provider organizations) negotiate lower rates with dentists in their network, aka their "preferred providers". Most DPPOs are what is known as "100-80-50" plans: The plan covers 100% of preventative services, 80% of certain basic procedures and 50% for major services such as crowns [人造牙冠].

# 4.Indemnity dental insurance [牙科赔偿险]
> A dental indemnity insurance plan allows you to visit any dentist. It pays a set amount based on a pre-calculated [提前计算好] “usual, customary and reasonable” (UCR) fee [常规、照例且合理费用]. Very often 【经常】, you must pay an additional amount out of pocket.
