# I.The Desert Survival Exercise for Team Building
> The situation on which today's lesson is based is one that is often run [运用] by organizations like schools, businesses, etc. Whereas in our survival situation you are alone in the desert, usually this is run as a group activity. Although it may be used to evaluate individuals, it's most often used as a teambuilding exercise that promotes synergy /'sɪnɚdʒi/ [协作力] among the team members. At the same time, it also objectively measures [客观的衡量] whether the team is achieving synergy.

> Synergy takes place when the interactive efforts of two or more people make a solution that is superior to their independent solutions [互动努力达成比独立行动更为优质的解决方案]. For businesses, this is clearly desirable as a means to improve team dynamics [提高团队动力]. For schools, it's a good way to teach students to work effectively in groups.

> Your task for today:1) Decide whether you are staying, waiting to be rescued or setting out to look for help;2) Rank 5 items at your disposal /dɪ'spozl/ [n.处理] in the order of importance;

# II.The Survival Genre /'ʒɑnrə/ [生存游戏]
> In this series we have been focusing on a desert survival situation. Survival is also a common theme in Western literature /'lɪtrətʃɚ/ [n.文学], cinema [电影], and television. Although the desert setting is not always used, stories of one person's or a group's survival have always been able to attract the public's attention.

> One of the first survival stories was the ancient Greek epic poem [古希腊史诗], "The Odyssey" /ˈɑdɪsi/ [奥德赛]. At one point in the story the hero is shipwrecked /'ʃiprekt/ [失事] alone on an island for years. Many of the most famous stories in the centuries that came after follow that lead [影响了后来几个世纪]. Daniel Defoe's "Robinson /'rɑbɪnsən/ Crusoe /'kru:səu/" [鲁宾逊漂流记], published in 1719, is about a man who, after being left alone on an island, learns how to grow food, hunt, and make wine. 

> The 20th century saw many more novels that followed this pattern [遵循这种模式]. "The Lord of the Flies" [苍蝇之王](1954) by William Golding [威廉·戈尔丁] is a very dark story [黑暗的故事] about a ship full of British schoolchildren who must learn how to build a society on their new island home. More recently, "Life of Pi" [少年派漂流记]tells the story of a boy alone on a lifecraft floating across the ocean. Both these books, along with several others, have been made into [拍摄成] very successful movies.

> Speaking of movies, "Castaway" was a big hit [火了一把] for movie star Tom Hanks. And more recently, the survival genre was relocated to the planet Mars with "The Martian" [火星人], starring /stɑr/ [v.主演] Matt Damon.

> On the small screen [电视屏幕上], "Gilligan's Island" [吉利根岛] was a comedy [喜剧] that told the story of a small group of castaways /'kæstəwe/ [n.被抛弃的人] on a desert island. In the 1990s and 2000s, "Survivor [幸存者]" was a long-running reality TV series [真人秀] that placed competing teams in remote areas around the globe. And who could forget "Lost"?[经典的美剧]

> People have always enjoyed survival stories, not just because the characters [人物] demonstrate great bravery [勇气] and skill, but also because they always show what humans are like outside of society [脱离社会]. Humans are social creatures [社会生物], but by placing them in situations outside of society, the author can make some very interesting points about how society functions, or what the ideal society should be.[反而对社会如何运作或者理想的社会应该是什么样子，产生有趣的观点]

> 3) It's basically what's left behind after a crash. let's say you have a car crash on the road, and two cars hit each other and neither one can are drivable /'draɪvəbl/ [adj.可行驶的]. So the cars that are left behind you can just call wreckage. Brooken glass, bent medal, stuff like that.

***Do you stay at the crash site hoping to be rescued? Or do you set off to find help?After you decide which course of action to follow, you need to rank 15 items salvaged from the airplane in the order of importance to your survival.***

***Let's see what the survival experts say.First and foremost, you need to decide on the course of action: stay or go?The answer is stay. Why? You simply don’t have enough water to sustain you as you walk to the nearest town.***
