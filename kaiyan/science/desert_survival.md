# I.The Desert Survival Exercise for Team Building
> The situation on which today's lesson is based is one that is often run [运用] by organizations like schools, businesses, etc. Whereas in our survival situation you are alone in the desert, usually this is run as a group activity. Although it may be used to evaluate individuals, it's most often used as a teambuilding exercise that promotes synergy /'sɪnɚdʒi/ [协作力] among the team members. At the same time, it also objectively measures [客观的衡量] whether the team is achieving synergy.

> Synergy takes place when the interactive efforts of two or more people make a solution that is superior to their independent solutions [互动努力达成比独立行动更为优质的解决方案]. For businesses, this is clearly desirable as a means to improve team dynamics [提高团队动力]. For schools, it's a good way to teach students to work effectively in groups.

> Your task for today:1) Decide whether you are staying, waiting to be rescued or setting out to look for help;2) Rank 5 items at your disposal /dɪ'spozl/ [n.处理] in the order of importance;

# II.The Survival Genre /'ʒɑnrə/ [生存游戏]
> In this series we have been focusing on a desert survival situation. Survival is also a common theme in Western literature /'lɪtrətʃɚ/ [n.文学], cinema [电影], and television. Although the desert setting is not always used, stories of one person's or a group's survival have always been able to attract the public's attention.

> One of the first survival stories was the ancient Greek epic poem [古希腊史诗], "The Odyssey" /ˈɑdɪsi/ [奥德赛]. At one point in the story the hero is shipwrecked /'ʃiprekt/ [失事] alone on an island for years. Many of the most famous stories in the centuries that came after follow that lead [影响了后来几个世纪]. Daniel Defoe's "Robinson /'rɑbɪnsən/ Crusoe /'kru:səu/" [鲁宾逊漂流记], published in 1719, is about a man who, after being left alone on an island, learns how to grow food, hunt, and make wine. 

> The 20th century saw many more novels that followed this pattern [遵循这种模式]. "The Lord of the Flies" [苍蝇之王](1954) by William Golding [威廉·戈尔丁] is a very dark story [黑暗的故事] about a ship full of British schoolchildren who must learn how to build a society on their new island home. More recently, "Life of Pi" [少年派漂流记]tells the story of a boy alone on a lifecraft floating across the ocean. Both these books, along with several others, have been made into [拍摄成] very successful movies.

> Speaking of movies, "Castaway" was a big hit [火了一把] for movie star Tom Hanks. And more recently, the survival genre was relocated to the planet Mars with "The Martian" [火星人], starring /stɑr/ [v.主演] Matt Damon.

> On the small screen [电视屏幕上], "Gilligan's Island" [吉利根岛] was a comedy [喜剧] that told the story of a small group of castaways /'kæstəwe/ [n.被抛弃的人] on a desert island. In the 1990s and 2000s, "Survivor [幸存者]" was a long-running reality TV series [真人秀] that placed competing teams in remote areas around the globe. And who could forget "Lost"?[经典的美剧]

> People have always enjoyed survival stories, not just because the characters [人物] demonstrate great bravery [勇气] and skill, but also because they always show what humans are like outside of society [脱离社会]. Humans are social creatures [社会生物], but by placing them in situations outside of society, the author can make some very interesting points about how society functions, or what the ideal society should be.[反而对社会如何运作或者理想的社会应该是什么样子，产生有趣的观点]
