# II.grammar
# 1.hold a meeting/event
> the verb hold has several meanings and can be used with several kinds of words. In this lesson, it means “to make a meeting or event happen”.

- 1. Can we hold a meeting to discuss this tomorrow? 

- 2. The company is set to hold a conference about its future vision. 

- 3. The election will be held on October 8.

# 2.nudge /nʌdʒ/ [n & v.推动]
> it's like a little push, usually with your elbow, not always but usually. And, and when you're pushing someone, you might be trying to encourage them.Encourage them to do something.you just gonna, just nudge them a little bit.you know my brother owes me some money. A lot of money, and he keeps forgetting to send it to me, so I have to like nudge him. Hey, hey, I'm not actually pushing him, I'm just giving him a little hint.Just a little reminder.

# 3.recipient [n.获奖人] & receiver /rɪ'sivɚ/ [n.接收人] & laureate /'lɔrɪət/ [n.获奖者，常指学术类奖项] & over the years [phr.历年] 
> 1)somebody who receives a, a bank transfer or an e-mail is called a recipient.Now in that case you probably could say "receiver"?You could. It's possible.But it's just better to just use this word "recipient".

> 2)we we are going to keep coming back to this idea of honour and glory winning this award, so you wouldn't say just like a receiver.it's something we use in in football and some electronics. So just to make it less confusing, stick with recipient.

> 3)So laureate here is a really another word that, that just makes me think about honor and glory, and all of those prestigious words that I said earlier.so it's kind of like a recipient in this case, but there's also this high honor.

# 4.classical economics & behavioral economics [n.行为经济学]
> 1）So classical economics believes that people are reasonable or they, they make logical decisions. Based on what they need. You know like, I am a reasonable person who needs to eat. I see that the price of beef is much more expensive than the price of pork, so I will probably buy pork.

> 2)But we all know that people can be very emotional and kind of, a little bit crazy.We have so many emotions and so behavioral economics is, it's much more modern.So like, it's just study of people's behaviours, their, their psychology, yeah, and the decisions that people make.

# 5.specialty /ˈspɛʃəlti/ [n.专业;专长] & area & field 
> 1)So he focuses or he specializes /'spɛʃəlaɪz/ [vi.专门从事] in behavioral economics. That's his field or his specialty.we could also say area,in his subject that he's studying.

> 2)So the Nobel prize has six fields in total: physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, peace, and economics,and that usually goes to like, world leaders, like Obama got the peace prize.That's a prestigious one.If you ask me something about some subjects that I, I don't know much about, I might say, that's not really my field.

# 6.ceremony & pomp and circumstance [phr.排场宏大] & give out rewards [颁奖] & Alfred Nobel
> 1)Ceremony, it's like the event.It's the event is a good way to put it. Because it's not only the place but it's also what happens at the place, who comes to the place.people dress up in nice suit and, and they give a speech, that's what, that's holding the ceremony.

> 2)And one thing about ceremonies, and it doesn't matter if it's a graduation ceremony or you know it's Nobel prize ceremony, there's always what we call pomp and circumstance.So again we're talking about this honor and respect.When you go to a ceremony like this, you should dress in like a tuxedo, or a nice suit.since it's one of the most prestigious ceremonies in the world, there is this pomp and circumstance.

> 3)I think I'm also thinking wedding, like the wedding ceremonies, I mean we usually be dressed up for wedding ceremonies, we could say there isn't as much ceremony these days.if you're going to some other kind of ceremony that, that, a little more casual, maybe you don't need to wear a suit.

> 4)So at these ceremonies, this is where they give out the awards, they do speeches, but they give out the awards.So it's always going to be give out an award, I mean you could say you know we gave an award to someone.But usually when you're talking in general, like at the Oscars, they give out the Oscar.

> 5)The reason they have this prize, the Nobel prize is because he invented dynamite /'daɪnə'maɪt/ [n.炸药].so if you guys know TNT,I mean, you can blow up mountains. Like it's pretty amazing. Unfortunately you can also blow up your brother, which is what Alfred Nobel did.So the story goes, he felt so guilty about killing his brother that he started this foundation to give out not only gold medals, but also a handsome sums of money to different people.

# 7.foundation /faʊn'deʃən/  [n.基础，基金会] & handsome sum of money [phr.一笔相当可观的钱] & put forward [v.用于]
> 1) the foudation is like the bottom of a building, the first when you start building.Or like the foundation of like a language. You have to build a foundation.

> 2)So it's kind of like one person or one organization is giving to many people like many awards.It usually is kind of one, you know, authority figure kind of giving out something to many people.And the reason they give out the awards in Sweden is that's where the foundation started.So this is an organization and it's usually for helping people.like the Clinton Foundation. There's also the Bill Gates Foundation.So they often give money to people, they do research to trying to help the world.

> 3)handsome sum of money, just means unusually large, or or or generous.I mean usually hear those two words together, it might sound kind of strange because you know, handsome, sum.

> 4)put toward.So when they get this handsome sum of money, it's often used, they invest it in research.it's an honourable thing to do, they don't want to use that money to buy a new car.But the thing is, even if they wanted to, I mean let's say here, you know I'm a recipient, but you know I also have a kid, who needs to go to university, I could also say I'm going to put this money towards my kid's college education.a lot of people put money towards their student loan. they need to borrow money to go to university.and then you know after you've paid down that student loan, you could put some money toward a down payment on a house.It's any big thing that you use money for. 

> 5)Now one interesting thing is that, in the dialogue you will hear "put toward." Probably you have also heard us also say "put towards."it's kind of a slang thing. It's just easier to say "put towards."if you want to get like grammatically correct, maybe "put toward."
