> 当前，世界更加看好中国，不少外国人羡慕中国人的好日子。诸多欧美学者认为，西方骄傲自大的“中心主义”蒙蔽了其心智，面对中国的成功，西方应及时反思和学习。在别人认同“中国经济前景光明论”时，我们不能自己唱衰自己，误判世界发展大势和我国促进，低估自身发展潜力，妄自菲薄，丧失信心。当然，我们也要有忧患意识，居安思危，要看到各种风险和挑战，不能高枕无忧、无所作为。多数机遇都不是不争自来的，机遇需要我们自己去创造和把握。只要我们继续走自己的路，谦虚谨慎，开拓进取，攻坚克难，不断加强和发展自身的优势，我们的例子就会越过越好。

Currently,the world is more optimistic about china,and many foreigners actually are envying Chinese people's **good days**,A number of European and American scholars believe that the West has been blindfolded by its arrogance and egocentricity.Facing China's success,the West should reexamine itself and learn from China in a timely manner.While others agree to the "theory of China having a brilliant economic future,"we have no reason to **lower our own morale,misjudge the global development trend and China's own conditions,underestimate our development potential and even look down upon ourselves and lose confidence.**
Of course,we should always be vugilant against possible danger and trouble,be aware of various risks and challenges,and should not be over-confident or do nothing.Actually,most opportunities are hard-earned,and therefore,we need to creat and seize them.As long as we continue to focus on our own development and to be **modest,cautious,enterprising and brave,continuously strengthen** and develop our own strength,our days will certainly become better and better.

earning us the irksome epithet"boomerang generation"给我们带来了啃老一族的坏名声

we're hanging out in our parents' basements rather than marrying and starting legally recognized unions of our own.
我们在父母房子的地下室里谈情说爱，而不愿意结婚，成为合法夫妻。

partly as a result 由于这部分原因

These standard,American-dream-style signposts still retain an incredibly strong hold over young people's desire and aspirations.
那些标准的、美国梦式的标杆仍然令人难以置信的主宰着年轻人的欲望和抱负。

> 中文是世界上最古老的文字之一，传说中的仓颉造字让中国人有了共同的根。从甲骨文到简体汉字，中文伴随着中华民族绵延至今。中文铸造了中华民族的精神品格。比如说，中文书写各笔画都要伸缩有毒，相互映衬，取长补短，以使整个字浑然一体。这体现了中国人谦让包容、合作共赢的处事风格。中文富有哲理，很多字由意生字，寓意丰富。中文的“信”由“人”和“言”组成，意思就是“人要言而有信”。这是中国人的做人原则，也是中国与世界各国的相处之道。中文的优美、简练举世公认。中文是从象形字演变而来，逐步发展成一种可以欣赏的书写艺术，这在世界上是独特的。

Chinese is one of the oldest languages in the world.The Chinese characters,which were saild to be created by the legendary Cang Jie,are an important part of the shared cultural root of the Chinese people.From **oracle bone inscriptions** to simplified Chinese characters,the language has evolved along with the Chinese nation.The Chinese language has shaped the mind and character of Chinese nation.**For instance,the strokes come in different shapes and they are well structured to form balanced characters**.In a small way,this reflects the Chinese perefernce for modesty,accommodation and achieving win-win results through cooperation.
**This Chinese language is a product of philosophical thinking.The way a character is structured carries deep meaning.**For example,the character xin,meaning trust,is made up of two parts,which stand for"man"and "word"respectively.This shows that trust means a man should keep his word.This is the principle that guides the interpersonal relations of every individual Chines,and the way through which China manages its relations with other countries.The beauty and simplicity of the Chinese language is widely recognized in the world.The characters can be traced back to the ancient **pictograph**,which were literally drawings of things.Today,the writing of Chinese characters,knows as **caligraphy**,has become an art of drawing.In this way,the Chinese language is a unique language in our world.

that wry phrase describes us all more than we'd like to admit.
这句嘲讽的话是给我们大家的写照，而我们却不大愿意承认。

that all of us possess many beliefs that are flawed or flat-out wrong ——and also that we cling to these fallacies with remarkable tenacity.
我们都保佑许多有问题的、乃至全然错误的观念，而我们还异常顽固的坚持这些错误的观念。

but especially when our previous beliefs(even though faulty)have proved useful to us,and when they appear to be confirmed by everyday experience,we are reluctant to let them go.
然而有期是在我们先前的观念（尽管是错误的）已被证明对我们是有用的，且这些挂念师傅得到日常经验证实的时候，我们是不愿意放弃这些观念的。

students ingored correct textual information when it confilicted with their previously held concepts.On measures of free recall and recognition,the students consistently let their incorrect prior knowledge override incoming correct information.
学生们在正确的文本信息和他们先前持有的观念发生冲突时，他们会无视这些正确的信息，就进行自由回忆和认知程度而言，学生们始终会让他们先前不正确的知识凌驾于解除的正确信息之上。

> 历史是一面镜子。以史为鉴，才能避免重蹈覆辙。对历史，我们要心怀敬畏、心怀良知。历史无法改变，但未来可以塑造。铭记历史，不是为了延续仇恨，而是要共同引以为戒。传承历史，不是为了纠结过去。而是要开创未来，让和平的薪火代代相传。“大道之行也，天下为公”。和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由，是全人类的共同价值，也是联合国的崇高目标。目标远未完成，我们仍需努力。当今世界，各国相互依存、休戚与共、我们要继承和弘扬联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，打造人类命运共同体，为此，我们需要做出共同努力。

History is a mirror.Only be drawing lessons from history can the world aviod repeating past **calamity**,We should view history with awe and human consciences.The past cannot be changed,but the future can be shaped.Bearing history in mind is not to perpetuate hatred.Rather,it is for mankind not to forget its lessons.Remembering history does not mean being obsessed with the past.Rather,in doing so,we aim to create a better future and pass the torch of peace form generation to generation.
As an ancient Chinese adage goes.**The greast ideal to create a world truly shared by all/A public spirit will rule all under the heaven when the great Way prevails/When the great way is followed,all under heaven will be equal.** Peace,development,fairness,justice,democracy and freedom are common values of all mankind and the lofty goals of the United Nations.Yet these goals are far from being achieved,and we must continue our endeavor to meet them.In today's world,all countries are interdependent and share a common future.We should renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,build a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation,and creat a community of shared future for mankind.To achieve this goal,we need to make joint efforts.

In barely on generation we've moved from exulting in the time-saving devices that have so expanded our lives to trying to get away from them - often in order to make more times.
仅仅一代人的时间，我们就变了：从为省时装置大大扩展了我们的生活而欢欣鼓舞，发展到试图远离他们——往往是为了腾出更多的时间。

we appear to have gone from knowing nothing about the world to knowing too much all but overnight.
几乎在一夜之间，我们从对世界一无所知变成了知道的太多
