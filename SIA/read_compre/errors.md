> 当前，世界更加看好中国，不少外国人羡慕中国人的好日子。诸多欧美学者认为，西方骄傲自大的“中心主义”蒙蔽了其心智，面对中国的成功，西方应及时反思和学习。在别人认同“中国经济前景光明论”时，我们不能自己唱衰自己，误判世界发展大势和我国促进，低估自身发展潜力，妄自菲薄，丧失信心。当然，我们也要有忧患意识，居安思危，要看到各种风险和挑战，不能高枕无忧、无所作为。多数机遇都不是不争自来的，机遇需要我们自己去创造和把握。只要我们继续走自己的路，谦虚谨慎，开拓进取，攻坚克难，不断加强和发展自身的优势，我们的例子就会越过越好。

Currently,the world is more optimistic about china,and many foreigners actually are envying Chinese people's **good days**,A number of European and American scholars believe that the West has been blindfolded by its arrogance and egocentricity.Facing China's success,the West should reexamine itself and learn from China in a timely manner.While others agree to the "theory of China having a brilliant economic future,"we have no reason to **lower our own morale,misjudge the global development trend and China's own conditions,underestimate our development potential and even look down upon ourselves and lose confidence.**
Of course,we should always be vugilant against possible danger and trouble,be aware of various risks and challenges,and should not be over-confident or do nothing.Actually,most opportunities are hard-earned,and therefore,we need to creat and seize them.As long as we continue to focus on our own development and to be **modest,cautious,enterprising and brave,continuously strengthen** and develop our own strength,our days will certainly become better and better.

> 中文是世界上最古老的文字之一，传说中的仓颉造字让中国人有了共同的根。从甲骨文到简体汉字，中文伴随着中华民族绵延至今。中文铸造了中华民族的精神品格。比如说，中文书写各笔画都要伸缩有毒，相互映衬，取长补短，以使整个字浑然一体。这体现了中国人谦让包容、合作共赢的处事风格。中文富有哲理，很多字由意生字，寓意丰富。中文的“信”由“人”和“言”组成，意思就是“人要言而有信”。这是中国人的做人原则，也是中国与世界各国的相处之道。中文的优美、简练举世公认。中文是从象形字演变而来，逐步发展成一种可以欣赏的书写艺术，这在世界上是独特的。

Chinese is one of the oldest languages in the world.The Chinese characters,which were saild to be created by the legendary Cang Jie,are an important part of the shared cultural root of the Chinese people.From **oracle bone inscriptions** to simplified Chinese characters,the language has evolved along with the Chinese nation.The Chinese language has shaped the mind and character of Chinese nation.**For instance,the strokes come in different shapes and they are well structured to form balanced characters**.In a small way,this reflects the Chinese perefernce for modesty,accommodation and achieving win-win results through cooperation.
**This Chinese language is a product of philosophical thinking.The way a character is structured carries deep meaning.**For example,the character xin,meaning trust,is made up of two parts,which stand for"man"and "word"respectively.This shows that trust means a man should keep his word.This is the principle that guides the interpersonal relations of every individual Chines,and the way through which China manages its relations with other countries.The beauty and simplicity of the Chinese language is widely recognized in the world.The characters can be traced back to the ancient **pictograph**,which were literally drawings of things.Today,the writing of Chinese characters,knows as **caligraphy**,has become an art of drawing.In this way,the Chinese language is a unique language in our world.

that wry phrase describes us all more than we'd like to admit.
这句嘲讽的话是给我们大家的写照，而我们却不大愿意承认。

that all of us possess many beliefs that are flawed or flat-out wrong ——and also that we cling to these fallacies with remarkable tenacity.
我们都保佑许多有问题的、乃至全然错误的观念，而我们还异常顽固的坚持这些错误的观念。

but especially when our previous beliefs(even though faulty)have proved useful to us,and when they appear to be confirmed by everyday experience,we are reluctant to let them go.
然而有期是在我们先前的观念（尽管是错误的）已被证明对我们是有用的，且这些挂念师傅得到日常经验证实的时候，我们是不愿意放弃这些观念的。

> 历史是一面镜子。以史为鉴，才能避免重蹈覆辙。对历史，我们要心怀敬畏、心怀良知。历史无法改变，但未来可以塑造。铭记历史，不是为了延续仇恨，而是要共同引以为戒。传承历史，不是为了纠结过去。而是要开创未来，让和平的薪火代代相传。“大道之行也，天下为公”。和平、发展、公平、正义、民主、自由，是全人类的共同价值，也是联合国的崇高目标。目标远未完成，我们仍需努力。当今世界，各国相互依存、休戚与共、我们要继承和弘扬联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，构建以合作共赢为核心的新型国际关系，打造人类命运共同体，为此，我们需要做出共同努力。

History is a mirror.Only be drawing lessons from history can the world aviod repeating past **calamity**,We should view history with awe and human consciences.The past cannot be changed,but the future can be shaped.Bearing history in mind is not to perpetuate hatred.Rather,it is for mankind not to forget its lessons.Remembering history does not mean being obsessed with the past.Rather,in doing so,we aim to create a better future and pass the torch of peace form generation to generation.
As an ancient Chinese adage goes.**The greast ideal to create a world truly shared by all/A public spirit will rule all under the heaven when the great Way prevails/When the great way is followed,all under heaven will be equal.** Peace,development,fairness,justice,democracy and freedom are common values of all mankind and the lofty goals of the United Nations.Yet these goals are far from being achieved,and we must continue our endeavor to meet them.In today's world,all countries are interdependent and share a common future.We should renew our commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter,build a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation,and creat a community of shared future for mankind.To achieve this goal,we need to make joint efforts.

In barely on generation we've moved from exulting in the time-saving devices that have so expanded our lives to trying to get away from them - often in order to make more times.
仅仅一代人的时间，我们就变了：从为省时装置大大扩展了我们的生活而欢欣鼓舞，发展到试图远离他们——往往是为了腾出更多的时间。

we appear to have gone from knowing nothing about the world to knowing too much all but overnight.

> 我们正处在一个快速发展变化的世界。世界多极化、经济全球化、社会信息化深入推进，各种挑战层出不穷，各国利益紧密相连。零和博弈，冲突对抗早已不合时宜，同舟共济、合作共赢成为时代要求。中国人历来讲究“信”。2000多年前，孔子就说：“人而无信，不知其可也。”信任是人与人关系的基础，国与国交往的基础。我们要通过经常性沟通，积累战略互信。中国宋代诗人辛弃疾有一句名言，叫做“青山遮不住，毕竟东流去”。只要我们坚定方向，qi而不舍，就一定能推动中美两国关系建设得到更大发展。

We now live in a world of rapid development and changes.The move toward multi-polarity,the increasing trend of globalization,and the quick application of information technologies have all been accompanied by growing challenges of various sorts,and have brought contries even closer than ever before.It is a time when ideas of **zero-sum game conficts and confrontationn** must give way to common development and win-win cooperations.
For the Chinese,trust has always been a philosophy upheld vastly.In the world of Confucius,who lived over 2000 years ago,**a man without trust can hardly accomplish anything.** Trust stands as the basis of relationship among people,and provides a prerequisite for state-to-state exchanges.We need to maintain frequent communication and build up strategic mutual trust.Xin Qiji,**a poet in China;s Song Dunasty,one wrote,"Thick mountains could not stop the river from flowing into the sea."(It means that all rivers have to travel a meandering course befor reaching their destination.)** For China and US,as long as we stay focused on our goal and preserve in our efforts,we will be able to make even greater progress in building the new model of major-country relationship.

The British public's vote to leave the EU has set off political and scientific shock waves that could roil Europe and the world for years to come.The decision has dismayed scientists in the UK and cross Europe,as it stands to disrupt scientific funding and teh UK's stature in the European and international research communities.
英国脱欧公投在政界和科学界都引起了轩然大波，它将对今后若干欧洲乃至全世界带来动荡。英国和欧洲各国的科研人员都对脱欧决议表示失望，他们认为此举扰乱了科研资助体制，影响了英国在欧洲和国际学术界的地位。

The Brexit might possibly cause potontial damage to the UK's reputation as a destination for top-flight researchers.Also at stake is European funding for the UK's research universities.
英国一度享有“一流科研人员工作理想地”的美誉，然而“脱欧”则很可能使英国不再具有这种吸引力。

> 英国时最早开始探索代议制的国家。早在13世纪，英国议会就初具雏形，成为世界上最古老的议会。在中国，以民为本和依法治国的思想自古有之。约在四千年前，夏禹时期就有“民惟邦本，本固邦宁”的说法。中国古人认为：“国无常强，无常弱。奉法着强则国强，奉法者弱则国弱。”两千多年前，中国就有了成文的法典。现在，中国人民正在全面推进依法治国，既吸收中华法制的优良传统，也借鉴世界各国法治的有益做法。目标就是坚持法律面前人人平等，加快建设中国特色社会主义法治体系。在这方面，两国的立法机关可以加强交流互鉴。

Britain was the first country to establish the system of representative government.The British Parliament,which came into being in the 13th century,is the oldest parliament in the world.In China,the concept of **putting people first and following the rule of law** emerged in the ancient times./**About 4000 years ago,during the regin of YU the Greast in the Xia Dynasty,there was already a saying that the people are foundation of a country.and only with a stable foundation can a counyry enjoy peace.** The ancient Chinese believed that"no country will stay strong or weak forever.**He who abides by the law will make a country strong while he who fails to do so will make a country weak.** Chinese first code a statutes was complied over 2000 years ago./Today,as Chinese people are advancing the rule of law in an all-round way,they draw inspiration from not only China's own legal traditions,but also the best practices of the rule of law of other countries.Our goal is to ensure that all are equal before the law,and accelerate the development of system of socialist law-based governance with distinct Chinese features.The legislatures of our two countriess should initiata/can have more exchanges to enhance mutual learning in this regard.
