> 当前，世界更加看好中国，不少外国人羡慕中国人的好日子。诸多欧美学者认为，西方骄傲自大的“中心主义”蒙蔽了其心智，面对中国的成功，西方应及时反思和学习。在别人认同“中国经济前景光明论”时，我们不能自己唱衰自己，误判世界发展大势和我国促进，低估自身发展潜力，妄自菲薄，丧失信心。当然，我们也要有忧患意识，居安思危，要看到各种风险和挑战，不能高枕无忧、无所作为。多数机遇都不是不争自来的，机遇需要我们自己去创造和把握。只要我们继续走自己的路，谦虚谨慎，开拓进取，攻坚克难，不断加强和发展自身的优势，我们的例子就会越过越好。

Currently,the world is more optimistic about china,and many foreigners actually are envying Chinese people's **`good days`**,A number of European and American scholars believe that the West has been blindfolded by its arrogance and egocentricity.Facing China's success,the West should reexamine itself and learn from China in a timely manner.While others agree to the "theory of China having a brilliant economic future,"we have no reason to lower our own morale,misjudge the global development trend and China's own conditions,underestimate our development potential and even look down upon ourselves and lose confidence.Of course,we should always be vugilant against possible danger and trouble,be aware of various risks and challenges,and should not be over-confident or do nothing.Actually,most opportunities are hard-earned,and therefore,we need to creat and seize them.As long as we continue to focus on our own development and to be `modest,cautious,enterprising and brave,continuously strengthen` and develop our own strength,our days will certainly become better and better.
