       Q:what kinds of businesses you think will be important for the economy in china in the future?
       A： 1）Financial Services
              Financial Services is a huge industry and includes services such as banking, investment
              banking, mutual funds, foreign exchange and much more. A successful modern economy is mostly
              dependant on a steady and efficient financial system making financial services an essential
              ingredient of a thriving economy. So as long astrong economies are required Financial 
              Services are required.

           2）Sharing Economy
              There are 100s of things that we have, but don't use it all the time (home, car, office, 
              bike). Sharing economy refers to someone else using it while you are not using. This is 
              already a billion dollar industry (led by AirBnb). However, we have not seen the biggest yet 
              and could easily be 10s of billions. I have booked 50+ days with Flightcar (renting someone 
              else's car while they are on travel), and I can see potential. There are 100s of segments of
              this industry that are emerging (such as AirEnvy and Homejoy). Things like research labs will
              be a part of this economy.
           
           3）Electric cars
              Tesla has finally started to produce a more sustainable electric car model. However, we have
              a long way to go in revolutionzing battery technology, distribution stations, and creating
              automobiles. Most likely, this will be a repacement industry.
           
           4）Online education and training
              Online education and training: The MOOCs have started scratching the surface of education. 
              However, moving just videos online doesn't make a school. Education is a trillion dollar 
              industry and it will take 2 decades to enable the industry to reach to major inflection 
              point.
