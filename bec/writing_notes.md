- The aim of this report is to show the company’s results in the years 2001-2003.

# 2.body para 
    介绍主要数据（不用写每一个 percentage）+对比

- 1)In 2001, the company’s operating profit peaked at the $500 million and its turnover reached $6200 million as well. The whole year they sold $20 million units, which says it was a dramatic year.

- 2)In the following year, the company had to handle a huge decrease in operating profits of 20% and a decline of their turnover of almost $1 million. It was perhaps because of the less units sold.

- 3)In 2003, the company was able to deliver more units again, which was nearly 15 million. Their turnover, therefore, could jump at the same level of 2001. It was disappointing that their operating profits still went down, because they had to meet more marketing expenses.

## 2.1.动态图
       一个数据在不同时间的变化
- The graph illustrates changes in the amount of beef,lamb,chicken and fish consumed in a particular European country betweeen 1979 and 2004.

- In 1979 beef was by far the most popular of these foods,with about 225 grams cousumed per person per week.Lamb and chicken were eaten in similar quantities(around 150 grams),while much less fish was consumed(just over 50 grams).

### 2）逐个介绍数据变化

- However,during this 25-year period the consumption of beef and lamb fell dramatically to approximately 100 grams and 55 grams respectively.The consumption of fish also declined,but much less significantly to just below 50 grams,so although it remained the least popular food,consumption levels were the most stable.

       3.2）X 个降；
       3.3）X 个平

- The consumption of chicken,on the other hand,showed an upward trend,overtaking that of lamb in 1980 and that of beef in 1989.By 2004 it had soared to almost 250 grams per person per week.

- Overall,the graph shows how the consumption of chicken increased dramatically while the popularity of these other foods decreased over the period.

***Introduction:(目的)This proposal sets out to examine options for the successful globalization of [our ‘B’ brand]. (调查对象)The initial market under consideration is [Continental /kɒntɪ'nent(ə)l/ Europe]. (考查范围)For the purposes of this proposal, we will be considering [three aspects] of the brand, namely our logo, the ‘B’ concept and finally, the product itself, ‘B’ boots.***

     国际品牌，优势在何处?(万能思路)
