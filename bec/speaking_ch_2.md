       Q:what kinds of businesses you think will be important for the economy in china in the future?
       A： 1）Financial Services
              Financial Services is a huge industry and includes services such as banking, investment
              banking, mutual funds, foreign exchange and much more. A successful modern economy is mostly
              dependant on a steady and efficient financial system making financial services an essential
              ingredient of a thriving economy. So as long astrong economies are required Financial 
              Services are required.

           2）Sharing Economy
              There are 100s of things that we have, but don't use it all the time (home, car, office, 
              bike). Sharing economy refers to someone else using it while you are not using. This is 
              already a billion dollar industry (led by AirBnb). However, we have not seen the biggest yet 
              and could easily be 10s of billions. I have booked 50+ days with Flightcar (renting someone 
              else's car while they are on travel), and I can see potential. There are 100s of segments of
              this industry that are emerging (such as AirEnvy and Homejoy). Things like research labs will
              be a part of this economy.
           
           3）Electric cars
              Tesla has finally started to produce a more sustainable electric car model. However, we have
              a long way to go in revolutionzing battery technology, distribution stations, and creating
              automobiles. Most likely, this will be a repacement industry.
           
           4）Online education and training
              Online education and training: The MOOCs have started scratching the surface of education. 
              However, moving just videos online doesn't make a school. Education is a trillion dollar 
              industry and it will take 2 decades to enable the industry to reach to major inflection 
              point.

           I choose topic B:'the importance of being willing to make long business trips'.
           Being willing to make long business trips is quite important for career development.
           2.1)long business trips are essential for business people to 'close deals',especially in 
               international transactions.'Face-to-face meetings' can double the chance of closing
               deals,according to a study done by Oxford University.It is important to 'build the trust'
               between parties in the deal and the trust would be more difficult to generate via 
               telephone or internet.
           2.2)Long business trip are also critical for 'bullding the network that promotes career 
               development.Visting colleagues and customers in different parts of the world can 
               'increase understanding'.People in different countries may have different cultural 
               backgrounds and working principles and meetings in person after long trip wil be 
               productive in 'tackling cultural and communication barriers'.
               So,being in front of customers and colleagues results in benefits for business and 
               the willing to do so is important for care development.
