- [总]I choose topic B:'the importance of being willing to make
long business trips'.
Being willing to make 
long business trips
is quite important 
for career development.
- 1)long business trips are essential for business people to 
'close deals',
especially in 
international transactions.
'Face-to-face meetings' 
can double the chance 
of closing deals,
according to a
study done by 
Oxford University.
It is important 
to 'build the trust'
between parties 
in the deal and
the trust would 
be more difficult
to generate via 
telephone or internet.
- 2)Long business trip are also critical for 'bullding the
network that promotes career 
development.Visting
colleagues and customers
in different parts
of the world can 
'increase understanding'.
People in different 
countries may have
different cultural 
backgrounds and working
principles and meetings
in person after 
long trip wil be 
productive in 'tackling cultural
and communication
barriers'.
So,being in front of 
customers and
colleagues results
in benefits for 
business and 
the willing to 
do so is important
for care development.
