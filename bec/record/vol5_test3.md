***{consultant enjoy predicting the changes that their recommendations will make} _10A_it feels even better if they are still around when these are implemented.{In fact,such factors mean some consultants play down the improtance of pay as a motivating factor.}***

***_11B_(They) claim (rather that) they benefit from the whole working style,partly due to the degree of (diversity) within the job.{For example,consultants may be working in teams where as many as (ten diffierent nationalities) are represented.}***

***{...having drawn in recruits with promises that after 2 years in consultancy young graduates will( be able to do almost the job).}_13D_But people in industry also consider such (adaptability) valuable and make very attractive offers to consultants,which are hard to (resist).{The (temptation) /tem(p)'teɪʃ(ə)n/ [n. 诱惑, 引诱] is worrying for consultancy firms as demand for their services,and so their people,continues to grow at a prodigious /prə'dɪdʒəs/ [adj. 异常的,] rate,creating a huge recruitment need.}***

***_14E_It leaves them no choice but to develop the ability to integrate managers switching from industry(E 的重点是必须从外面招人，F 的重点是缺毕业生).{But so far,consultants recruited form the outside,as opposed to fresh form business schools,who adapt successfully remain minority.->consultants adapt successfully minority->从外面招聘的顾问很少能适应 }***
