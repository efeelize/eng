***_14E_It leaves them no choice but to develop the ability to integrate managers switching from industry(E 的重点是必须从外面招人，F 的重点是缺毕业生).{But so far,consultants recruited form the outside,as opposed to fresh form business schools,who adapt successfully remain minority.->consultants adapt successfully minority->从外面招聘的顾问很少能适应 }***
