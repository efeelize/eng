- it is expected that there will be a lot of people coming,so we have to consider the layout of the presentation room,a lecture-hall like auditorium /ɔːdɪ'tɔːrɪəm/ [n. 观众席, 听众席] is good for concentration.
- it should be U-shaped room for seminars or a round-table room for discussion.
- the room has to be equipped with basic presentation facilities,such as flip charts,equipment for using PPT effectively,microphones,white board and OHP,etc,so as to better publicise and promote the product to all prospective customers.

- we'd better choose a starred hotel with a complete range of conference facilities.
- it is likely to be associated with reliablity and professionalism,which can leave a better impression on people attending the presentation.
