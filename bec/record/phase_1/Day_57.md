# 3.topic:felxible patterns of work
## PART I.
### 1.what do you think is the major advantage of telecommuting
- telecommunting helps those with families spend more time together,it results in less pollution,and allows employees to work where and when they want to.

### 2.what's the advantage in working from home rather than an office
- have flexible management of time and work,it improve efficiency,increases production and improve employees' lives.

# PART II.what is improtant when starting jod sharing scheme
> role defining
- if it's shared responsibility,there is no division of duties but the two people have to split the hours clearly to ensure
that the work flows continuously;
- if it's divided responsibility,each partner has to be clear about his own caseload or project to focus on during his working
hours
- if it's unrelated responsibility,the partners have to learn what their separate tasks are in the same department,and each has to do his own share well.

> communication
- when you arrange the job-share,especially for shared responsiblity,partners have to communicate well so that jobs are done smoothly
- using e-mail,voicemail messages,daily logs and notes are some techniques that help facilitate communication.

# PART III:introducing home-working scheme
## benefit
- work-at-home can better control their hours to reserve time for family,hobbies,volunteer work and other personal intereats,while doing the work well.
- it is particularly useful for parents because it leaves them free to drop the children off in the morning and pick them
up in the afternoon,they can reduce child care costs and have more time with families.
- by working from home,they can have more time for further education and learning new skills to better improve themselves.
- means freedom from office politics,less stress and burn-out,they can come and go as they please,wear what they like,work the hours that suit them and focus on delivering good work.
- increase efficiency and improves performance,it reduces office space and cuts costs.

## deficient
- homeworking people need to be self-disciplined and self-motiviated since sometimes it is hard to differentiate between worktime and private time and it can be hard to stay motivated without the support of colleagues.

## how
- meetings should be arranged at regualr intervals for face-to-face communication and share of ideas to encourage staff interaction.
- the company can also have good control of these people by having timely review of their short-term targets,say,we can check their work progress on a monthly basis to see whether they manage their time well.
