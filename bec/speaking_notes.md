### 1.Q:what kinds of businesses you think will be important for the economy in china in the future?
- Argument 1:[Financial Services] Financial Services is a huge industry and includes services such as banking, investment banking, mutual funds, foreign exchange and much more. A successful modern economy is mostly dependant on a steady and efficient financial system making financial services an essential ingredient of a thriving economy. So as long astrong economies are required Financial Services are required.***

- Argument 2:[Sharing Economy] There are 100s of things that we have, but don't use it all the time (home, car, office, bike). Sharing economy refers to someone else using it while you are not using. This is already a billion dollar industry (led by AirBnb). However, we have not seen the biggest yet and could easily be 10s of billions. I have booked 50+ days with Flightcar(renting someone else's car while they are on travel), and I can see potential. There are 100s of segments of this industry that are emerging(such as AirEnvy and Homejoy). Things like research labs will be a part of this economy.***
           
- Argument3:[Electric cars] Tesla has finally started to produce a more sustainable electric car model. However,we have a long way to go in revolutionzing battery technology, distribution stations,and creating automobiles. Most likely, this will be a repacement industry.***
           
- Argument4:[Online education and training] Online education and training: The MOOCs have started scratching the surface ofeducation. However, moving just videos online doesn't make a school. Education is a trillion dollar industry and it will take 2 decades to enable the industry to reach to major inflection point.***
